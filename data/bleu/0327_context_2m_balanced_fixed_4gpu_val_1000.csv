michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, her sister, buster, who she shared her bed.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss mom.
i'll tell her.
i need to write a 000 words on the moral side of the war and the possibility of a conflict.
i'm not sure our vice teacher would like me to cheat while writing.
well, you passed my ethics test.
as a matter of fact, it was desperate for your teacher... who was desperate to have a crush.
even the hands of those who commit small crimes can be brutally chopped off.
no ring no ring no ring no ring no
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted father?
the s.d.k.'s eye was on us.
your dad thought it would make us look better.
he must have imitated my signature.
'maybe i'll have a son who's done slum cheese' a year ago!
you gotta get me out of this.
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't look at her either.
i don't have a mother's compassion and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yes-yes.
by the way, when did you sleep with anyone?
meanwhile, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
i'm telling you why.
i guess it's because there's some things you can't tell your dad about.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set up his teacher... to help him fulfill his motherhood.
there's nothing wrong with that.
however, i must say i'm a little hurt that you didn't think of me for that.
the halas can carry out this mission.
teachers can do that job.
surely, someday, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right in front of you.
lindsay had never been more proud of what she said her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i've been telling you about.
she's really... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
you have a moustache.
i mean, there's milk on the moustache.
yeah.
but gob mistook michael's kindness for sentimental attention... and feels he's competition to interfere.
because, you know, beyond adorable... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
_
and george scr was about to get a surprise visit.
i've read all your teachings and got all your tapes.
and i watched it all over again.
george s.r. recently released a series of tapes he'd given to people... to raise money from the spirituality he'd recently discovered.
i also lost two kilos of your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to learn.
this is a good place to start.
and after michael got rid of the two girls he had an appointment with, he met lindsay at parents' night.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this place have the same floor plan as our kitchen floor with our kitchen floor?
i think she's really good for you.
i used to think it would make him think of the motherhood.
besides, i can't rush into something like this just because my son wants me to, and i can't marry somebody.
i'm miss baerly, the ethics teacher.
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life... that could have been destroyed by a reckless trigger.
and michael got to know his son's ethics teacher.
that's the "rrrr" thing.
you know, it's so annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you were laughing.
"rrrr!" - "rrrr!"
but, you know, she's, like,
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a question for you.
can a parent-teacher invite a drink?
or... or... or... or... or
yeah, he's dead.
i think it's because of this mr. daniels stroke thing...
let's go get a drink.
yeah, maybe it'll help.
_
i've already told you many of my sins.
maybe you can tell me some of your sins.
well, there are legal demonstrations to my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me one of those things about... one of the things that happened in the college dorm.
and what is it that michael's meeting mrs. bayerly on his second date today...
michael, this little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it's him.
you have to peel it down to your pants to say one thing for sure.
yes, mother.
they'll take him back.
don't take your shoes off, little gentleman.!
don't take your shoes off!
he's out of control.
who is it?
this is "annong," your father and i adopted it.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille found out that buster was worried and even jealous.
and she knew how it felt to be overlooked.
annyong is now your sister's sister's sister's
cancel.
it stays.
listen, i'll call you back.
nice driving.
are you making dinner reservations?
he made a korean.
and after the dates....
michael took a step he hadn't taken in years.
well, do you think this is a good idea?
i think that's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we sneak in without waking everyone up?
this may not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i loved.
so i took someone you love.
i said "nashbagerblairjam."
listen, i know you're trying to get revenge on the marta thing.
i was lying to you when i told you i wouldn't try to sleep with her, so...
she has to admit it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i'm lucky i got rid of him.
it's okay.
so romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i have to say i don't know if it's real.
but now... your morality teacher...
yeah, i did it for her.
oh.
she loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm sure you're interested in her on the subject.
i'm sure you don't like sadam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to him to show that i care about him.
about the class?
i mean, i'm telling her that she loves my loyalty...
hey, george michael.
let me go home and think about this.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with him.
well, why did he do that?
why did she sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new...
he's not one of the good shooters who's targeting his target, and he's practically shooting everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think she's old?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
she was accompanying different dance girls... and i thought i'd go to her, go up to her, do something...
"hey, do you wanna dance?"
and she was like, "what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it different across the mirror, but...
but, you know, it was, like, we were dancing with a joke, or something.
i didn't think so detail.
don't you think you should go out with your own age?
like your cousin.
i stubbed a book that was difficult to find a picture of saddam's disappointment in the bathroom suite.
"what would saddam have done?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's exactly like our fire escape.
in prison, george s.r. was getting ready for the evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon is preparing his own prep.
how we doing?
we have a video.
and when george michael was still angry with gob... he went looking for a family expert to cause trouble.
i know you went out with shannon.
with that cheerleader?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different dances.
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and asked him... but he was breathing, and he dropped his phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe we should both go.
right, i mean, a bad example...
hello.
my mother took him.
he's making me sign him up for school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the situation with mrs. bearly and george michael.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
so you're interested in her.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality...
see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's in love with you, so...
she knows we're out.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most unpleasant thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been a half a semester of morality.
look, it was a preemptive move.
my brother was gonna try to sleep with you.
well, i want to leave you right now and i'm not coming back to you.
i understand.
starting right now.
_
george.
and she got to know him.
you can totally spill your heart to me here.
it's weighing on my soul.
you...
he's picking up the camera.
i'm taking you to the grandong dance, that's your dinner, so it's away with mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong man.
watch your back, my immigration little brother!
and the different spring dances were in the final tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you don't let her in just because she doesn't have your perfectly flawed, flawed-shaped nose-shaped eyes, strong square jaws.
wanna dance?
all right!
gob finally found shannon he was looking for...
he found out that gob had cheated on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i messed up our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about it for a long time, and-and...
that's... that's the right thing to do.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing at a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yes, with my ethical teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
i'm really touched that you're trying to protect me after i treated you so badly.
in fact, gob mistook michael's ethical teacher for the ethics teacher.
man, the type... she understands.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a teacher of citizenship.
second move.
i was talking to miss baerly, and i should never have brought gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed on some sad things, but...
i don't think we have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm taking this cake.
hey, you wanna dance?
i can't believe this is working.
next arrested in development.
buster's pull is toast.
stop, stop, stop, stop!!!!!!!!!!
it's forbidden to have candles here.
my mom would freak.
no, it's okay.
i light my candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
it's okay.
right here, let me help you.
these?
okay, here, i'll carry it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is something really, really extreme.
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
all right!
all right!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we'll all go one day, won't we?
four months ago, each of you joined an interview to join a never-before-seen tv show.
and guess what?
you won.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm a total gay guy and i'm proud of it.
that's sweet, isn't it?
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel, from england.
me too.
he's my brother stanton, my parole officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him over the head.
she doesn't know.
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
now they look like barack obama.
each of you will make $00,000, all you have to do is spend a night in this prison.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
fuck!
cool.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know it's not a prank?
right.
it's actually our third show, but we're not gonna run until the fall.
to find out if this is a prank, you're gonna have to play the game and earn the money.
you will be asked to perform a series of duties.
duties will force your borders, your courage and your imagination.
that sounds fun, right?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make up your mind now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i didn't have a girlfriend to admit it when she was high.
i have to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
around.
you'll notice.
the sum of money equally cut to the survivors of the survivors, but if you all get the night out, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can spend the night here.
anyone else want to join him?
i'm not.
there's no way i'm going to the city with this piss boy that i'm
i'm in.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you guys are idiots.
it's a fucking party joke, they're gonna fuck you all up.
you don't look like a bunch of idiots.
can't you see this is a recording party?
or get famous.
there's a human head there!
don't worry, it's not real.
it looked pretty real to me.
that's why they call us "special effects".
isn't it lovely?
a little sign of what's waiting for you in there.
thanks to our bounty special effects team.
follow me, friends.
in the hot swamp water, lazy alligators are waiting for their prey.
the indian crocodiles become long and spotted faces.
such gators...
guys.
i see you're working hard as usual.
ready?
we're all set.
and absolutely.
keep it up.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was a great job to scare them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are gonna go to the show.
you really looked like you were terrified.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, i look at this place, and it gives me the creeps.
did you know that?
the dead homeless?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
it must be a big coincidence.
you really think it's safe there?
safe enough for the insurance on the show.
any other questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're recording.
each of you has chosen your own free will to spend the night in prison to make $00,000 a head.
it's obvious, isn't it?
all right, let's get this party started.
you'll find everything you need in your main camp, that's the warden's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you took everything we had, so how can we write it?
go down the hall, turn right, right, right, then left.
straight up the stairs, left, right, and another left.
would you like me to repeat that?
yeah.
too bad.
there you will find a key to get rid of your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll have to wait and see.
i thought leaving the basement was awful.
enjoy, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to the mission.
would you mind not doing that?
i can't see a damn thing here.
does anybody remember where we were going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, two right, then left.
there was so much going on.
no, go straight down the hall, down the hall, no,
"go back to the left, make it right again, and left.
"then straight up to the stairs,
"sola, right and left again."
what are you?
smart.
illet, it's gonna be a great show.
careful.
careful.
oh, god.
what is this place?
and be ready.
it was fun.
let's speed them up.
okay, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
the power's going down, the generator should've kicked in.
fuck!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's cold in here.
look, the key.
yeah.
okay.
guys, look.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think so.
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what's up, man?
"hey, brave contestants.
"welcome to warden clem harvis' office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room.
"the chess rocks will determine your personal role.
"you cannot exchange your stones with other contestants.
"the raids were her favourite."
"now it's your turn to put your hand in the box".
shit.
well, who wants first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black hawk.
black rook.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
fuck!
that was really crazy.
my little piggies, welcome to duty.
now let me tell you about the pennyville state prison.
in 0000, with the cost in 0000, the cruel warden decided to increase his fortune by destroying certain expenses.
they were prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the warden's crimes were revealed.
the last person to be sentenced to death here was warden harvis himself.
rumor has it the warden was still wandering the halls.
you will be asked to face the principal tonight and face tortured souls under this building.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
does anyone want to change?
hell no!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the church of prison to complete his duty.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first hallway.
that sounds awesome.
thanks.
fuck!
what happened?
they turned off my flashlight.
i can't see anything.
all right, take it easy, randall.
turn right now and go straight.
they hanged the babies!
kids...
i think they've got it covered with speakerons.
the voices are more efficient than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
god!
that sounds lovely.
no, i'm fine, man.
freak.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
something came up.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're making a noise on the speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off the flashlight.
all right now?
_
"you will find the lord's prayer there.
"there has been disrespect for this place that was sacred 00 years ago,
"now this is the focus of unusual events."
oh, "the opposite."
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do that.
"by complete your mission...
"if there's no sign of a president,
"you can go back to camp."
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry about who i'm bothering.
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
" deliver us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"do not let evil rule us.
"and do not overcome us...
"for as we forgive those who owe us, forgive us our debts.
"give us our daily bread today.
"it's so heavenly...
"as in the sky,
"because rule and rule are yours."
please tell me i can go now.
"before i head for camp"...
jesus, randall, you need to blow out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look at the money made.
where'd she go?
from what i understand, the people who did this job had cut off our connection to our homo friend for a while to give us a more creepy weather.
whatever.
absolutely, it went very well.
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, dude, it's not that bad.
it's definitely not worth the money.
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it again.
they can assign you back.
don't joke.
i swear you don't even know how you feel there.
it's like walking in a thick fog, only as cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it just me, or does this feel cooler here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go to the next one.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you expect me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated.
let's get scelzi to go down and have a look, you'll fix it.
scelzi.
yeah.
i need you to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
either we talk or i'll go or i'll go or i
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i had a little research done.
are you talking about the girls from the town you sleep with when you say "don't move"?
am i right?
big lips, large hips, taylor.
okay, well, prison wasn't just for men, was it?
is there a women's department?
and the goddamn crazy manager wouldn't tell anyone if she'd walk around the women's section.
beat them, rape them, get them pregnant, and they starve.
some people say she's been feeding their own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this real story's gonna make a good turn!
everyone might be talking to us.
the story you made up is nothing compared to the truth.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do that, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
yeah?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they do.
good.
scelzi, what is that?
just a little something to get me through the night.
want some?
get your hairy ass here now, okay?
aye, aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the hell out of me.
i've got some pretty good stuff.
suit yourself.
we're totally ready to start.
i'd say my biggest fear is being buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will set you free."
ok, ok,
i'm at the end of liberty.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go right and turn right.
fuck!
what?
blood.
it's not real blood.
no swearing, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs are not below, but going up.
i'm sorry.
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down there, you'll see a door with bars.
he says...
fuck!
welcome to cell number five.
" considering the violence and insanity and the madness,
shit.
tell me what to do and i'll be out of this hell right now.
no!
thanks.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a prisoner can't commit suicide, if he can't,
"you will now live the punishment sent to a prisoner."
okay, where's the pit?
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult mission.
"what will you do when you're in the hole."
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my mission.
connie.
what?
check this out.
what?
it can't be...
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back and i specifically told you that you added something to the show, and you're still asking me why you were fired?
this is not our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you have to get that guy out, okay?
he's gonna fuck up the show.
fuck!
we'll be ruined.
and you didn't bring this?
cut it out, no.
it's obvious.
what's open?
come closer.
i asked you why you put a camera in the control room.
yeah.
the camera footage... they want to record the footage...
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
it's genius, isn't it?
absolutely brilliant.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to record how you scare us by putting something into the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
three.
black king and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you could come back.
smartass.
okay, black king and white horse go right and go to the gas chamber.
the white queen and the black horse go straight, and they go to the prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"the hawk and the horse go left and then right.
"take and ride down the hall to the end of the hall,
"and down the stairs".
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, pick up.
we're in.
"welcome to the gathering room.
there's gotta be a light in the back of your wall, turn it on.
" black king and white horse go into the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
it deserved the best, but it was a real place.
it's the only place the legal department can clean up.
isn't it beautiful?
pretty creepy.
oh, god.
what's that smell?
a documented true execution rooms often carry the smell of death itself.
of course, the smell is not your death.
when a man knows that his life is in its final moments, his anxious anxiety is caused by an epidemic that stinks too much.
in this case, the human smell we breathe now and the smell of the gas that killed him.
now for the fun time, ladies and gentlemen.
the black king is sitting in the chair.
black hawk?
that would be me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you'll find some meat and a pan.
"you'll cook and eat this meat."
man!
the inmates have always eaten the beef, pig, pig...
"or that there is no lamb or another meat...
"they were suspicious of it.
"they thought it was a pleasant meat they never tasted before."
you mean human flesh, right?
are you in?
yeah.
guess what now?
i give up.
you're gonna tie toni up.
i'm telling you, toni should fully experience the fear of the previous prisoners... before gassing gas.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends have some weird wishes.
are you okay?
okay.
"your job is to...
"to find the main van dead and cut the gas."
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
wanna bet?
$000 you're gonna throw up.
okay.
