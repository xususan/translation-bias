hello, <unk> </s>
finally, it comes down to who says the longest <unk> </s>
right? </s>
i would never have <unk> that morning if i hadn't stopped <unk> </s>
you gave <unk> an order to <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> didn't you? </s>
that's why you're a lonely <unk> </s>
no need to worry. </s>
to be <unk> by a foreign power and sacrifice your own lives to be <unk> </s>
americans would have made you general director no doubt. </s>
how many more lives will you spend on that <unk> </s>
<unk> what you think is <unk> <unk> </s>
the service is dying. </s>
but if i realized i was on the losing side, my career would be too short. </s>

i think it came from you. </s>
what's this? </s>
<unk> <unk> can cause more than six hours or <unk> </s>

it's not <unk> <unk> </s>
i ate <unk> <unk> </s>

please. </s>
tell me you didn't betray <unk> </s>
it's been four hours, <unk> </s>
you spend the last two hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd get out of that pretty <unk> </s>
i'm thinking. </s>
your letter said something to me. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
you can't go anymore. </s>
i have something that should be yours. </s>
your father was wearing this the night he died. </s>
<unk> found a way to <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> in a place where they can <unk> and <unk> and <unk> </s>
the night of the <unk> did you wear a wedding ring? </s>
you're lucky you're not good enough, <unk> </s>
after <unk> <unk> </s>
you <unk> </s>
<unk> not going to last forever, will. </s>
then who <unk> </s>
they're like me. </s>
it would really help if we could get rid of <unk> and <unk> men. </s>
there's room for every <unk> in <unk> <unk> </s>
one line is <unk> <unk> </s>
these new problems kill in the dark. </s>
these people will be grateful to you. </s>
i think we should wait here to keep them safe, but i worry that things will get worse. </s>
they have no idea who caused the dark <unk> </s>
besides, it's not what <unk> in the dark we need to worry about. </s>
how do you plan on <unk> this <unk> <unk> </s>
maybe it's a <unk> </s>
this is the last <unk> of <unk> <unk> </s>
i may need your <unk> and a new job. </s>
it's under <unk> but for beauty <unk> it's more than just a <unk> </s>
try to fix it. </s>
we talked about this. </s>
it's almost impossible to destroy the <unk> that <unk> <unk> him. </s>
sure, i just need <unk> information that i don't have. </s>
i'm gonna need a team. </s>
any idea what's going on? </s>
but there's a bad <unk> </s>
it's the only way i can get back to <unk> </s>
and because of the problem with the <unk> it was hard to drive. </s>
an <unk> to help fix the electric <unk> </s>
he <unk> as soon as he found out. </s>
if things didn't work out, i had to go to his <unk> </s>
what the hell do you think you're doing? </s>
<unk> <unk> the killer is out there somewhere. </s>
and i think he really wants to prove to you that he wants to help. </s>
well, whatever the reason, just keep an eye on him for me, okay? </s>
because neither of us have anything to do with new <unk> </s>
i'm not saying it's because it's my mom. </s>
when you leave i'll search the person in school who caused the dark <unk> </s>
he was <unk> and <unk> us. </s>
there was no choice, <unk> </s>
that's the third time in two weeks. </s>
now this is the serial killer <unk> </s>
all right, i'll go talk to <unk> </s>
dad always said you were a good man. </s>
<unk> father? </s>
there might be a way, but you can feel a lot more scary if you want to, so let's not do this.
i can't even find <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
you're telling me you can't find a town with <unk> <unk> </s>
that didn't cause any trouble. </s>
then why didn't we use <unk> to finish the <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
so how do we find him? </s>
a box of <unk> left behind by <unk> <unk> </s>
i don't think i need <unk> <unk> and <unk> is just the first <unk> </s>
<unk> said you'd find him. </s>
it's easy for <unk> to <unk> but sometimes things aren't what they <unk> </s>
i got a town to run. </s>

guys, i'd love to, but i've never done anything like this before. </s>

if all goes well, i'll be back with my <unk> <unk> </s>
that's <unk> husband, <unk> </s>
there's enough panic and fear. </s>
the same person murdered my son 27 years ago? </s>
we call it <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
what else do you expect of me, <unk> </s>
<unk> is doing his best to get the rules <unk> but he's not the type to kill people. </s>
it's the same thing as <unk> <unk> </s>
thanks to our friend there, we're keeping them in a prison of some kind. </s>
<unk> <unk> says he's working. </s>
damn, <unk> must have <unk> the <unk> energy <unk> </s>
that explains why the <unk> <unk> in town. </s>
this is <unk> five minutes or so. </s>
this is all we need to do in the dark. </s>
here, we can <unk> the <unk> <unk> to <unk> faster than the <unk> but there's nothing more we can do. </s>
you better run. </s>
help each other. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>

and who are you? </s>
<unk> is a <unk> </s>
like i said, i have business to attend to. </s>
we need to learn how to handle it. </s>
<unk> said i couldn't accept a present. </s>
then it stays with us. </s>
when the wedding comes, every bride is beautiful. </s>
remember, this is our fault. </s>
sit down. </s>
we'll take what we <unk> from the <unk> </s>
he doesn't want to talk. </s>

would you put aside your <unk> for others? </s>
that's what we all have to do. </s>
if someone is willing to spend their whole life <unk> to others, then they are not. </s>
it must be pretty <unk> to think like that. </s>
try. </s>
either way, tell me the truth. </s>
only then can you look at each other and light a fire in the <unk> </s>
then you'll be husband and wife. </s>

well, if that's true, if religion does help people lead moral lives, then one should take very seriously the <unk> that we're just going to stand here and let the devil take the <unk> </s>
because <unk> can stay with many people, and <unk> is the <unk> of these people. </s>
a lot of people would have meant something, and that's where they came from. </s>

why are you here, <unk> </s>
i don't know. </s>
your mother and i were very happy here, but... </s>
i don't care about things anymore. </s>
i don't know why. </s>
i think we should just forget about the <unk> and start <unk> them. </s>
that's a good idea. </s>
john, you can't do this! </s>
i'll make a list of things we enjoy myself. </s>
yes, sir. </s>
<unk> </s>

i think you made a mistake. </s>
hey, i got <unk> </s>

there was food in the <unk> </s>
i told you. </s>
just a little <unk> that's all. </s>
last night at <unk> <unk> </s>
the night before that, the <unk> <unk> </s>
your father was a foreign <unk> </s>
only the red <unk> <unk> </s>
that's red wine <unk> </s>
mom, that look. </s>
i don't want him to have any <unk> while i'm here. </s>
no one who eats <unk> <unk> is <unk> </s>
relax, <unk> </s>
don't believe anything. </s>
i'm just here with <unk> and don't worry about me. </s>
you sure you want to come, dad? </s>
it's gonna be a long meeting. </s>
no, i will. </s>
it'll do me good. </s>
i could buy you lunch here, you could watch a movie. </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
i'll be fine. </s>
okay. </s>
i want to see john <unk> <unk> <unk> please. </s>
he's expecting you. </s>

this is my father, jake <unk> </s>
dad, this is <unk> <unk> </s>
nice to meet you, mr. <unk> </s>
me too. </s>
will we be here in an hour? </s>
like i said. </s>
okay, well, take care, dad. </s>
wait a minute, wait a minute. </s>
we'll leave your father here. </s>
mr. <unk> why don't you come and work with us? </s>
i can handle this. </s>
<unk> we've given you all our <unk> and now our <unk> are <unk> less than <unk> </s>
how can you be so sure? </s>
<unk> never run a business like this before. </s>
and if you don't, we'll be <unk> <unk> and we'll never be able to do business with you again. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
it will pay for every minute it's open but the property it's on is worth at least 50 million. </s>
how can you be so sure of 50 million <unk> </s>
i can sell it for 40 million dollars. </s>
do you have any <unk> </s>
can i call you <unk> now? </s>
<unk> real value is <unk> million and we don't have a problem with every <unk> around it. </s>
we've <unk> all the general <unk> but we have a plan that will <unk> the <unk> <unk> within a few months. </s>
just selling it isn't enough? </s>
that way we can <unk> the <unk> </s>
if this goes well, we won't have to. </s>
i don't think i can take it. </s>
you can't do this! </s>
the other thing is that food <unk> is a good <unk> </s>
now, <unk> cash seems <unk> but not <unk> </s>
all in all, we don't have a problem with <unk> <unk> </s>
yeah, that looks good. </s>
johnny, what's going on in there? </s>
well, we're a <unk> <unk> <unk> dad. </s>
i didn't know you had information about something like this. </s>
actually, i don't know. </s>
the guy who came to us for money has no idea. </s>
we're just gonna shut down the company and then drop the <unk> </s>
is that your <unk> </s>
are you <unk> <unk> and then <unk> </s>
it's a little <unk> dad. </s>
we take this <unk> to <unk> </s>
the company gets really fucked up later. </s>
this is the third <unk> board coming in, and they're <unk> <unk> </s>
but i have a little <unk> <unk> and that's the point. </s>
<unk> is built on a <unk> <unk> </s>
so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and then <unk> <unk> </s>
have you ever tried these <unk> <unk> </s>
there's no money in that, dad. </s>
world <unk> johnny. </s>

but now you get to buy the job that you do, and then you kill him. </s>
did you hear anything about those <unk> <unk> </s>
rick <unk> </s>
tommy <unk> </s>
they all went to <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
there was no one there to say goodbye. </s>
next morning, no one else did what i did. </s>
the world belongs to two <unk> </s>
<unk> and <unk> </s>
i don't know, dad, <unk> </s>
it's all right, johnny. </s>
there's nothing wrong here. </s>
i'm a <unk> that's all. </s>
but you, you're <unk> </s>
you chose to be <unk> </s>
i refuse to take responsibility. </s>
you're a <unk> </s>
mom? </s>
what do you think? </s>
okay, dad. </s>
"if you see a <unk> <unk> you can see the <unk> </s>
why are you doing this? </s>
i've already written the written <unk> </s>
i know, but we have to be very careful. </s>

oh, i'm sorry. </s>
oh, you can sleep in the car. </s>
what are you talking about? </s>
that's my dad. </s>
those are the rules. </s>

i'll bet the girls are all over it. </s>
don't worry about me. </s>
it's nothing to be ashamed of. </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
is that true? </s>
yes, our <unk> is complicated too. </s>
good thing it wasn't like this when we were kids. </s>
if it was, i wouldn't have <unk> school. </s>
as if you were a student to me. </s>
<unk> was a great <unk> mom. </s>
he graduated high school. </s>
not even the book is <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
yeah, but all my good friends and all my books at the same time have <unk> <unk> </s>
but john was a good <unk> </s>

every friday night i walk out of the <unk> </s>
four books. </s>
if we don't get them back to <unk> we'll have four new books. </s>
you did more than that. </s>
so how does it work? </s>
were the girls on the other floor? </s>
somebody stop that man! </s>
i'm just happy. </s>
while you're here, <unk> and <unk> will handle things for you. </s>
sure, you get so used to hearing it, but you don't believe it's real. </s>
<unk> believe me. </s>
<unk> still <unk> </s>
i'm sorry. </s>
so when do we have to go to school? </s>
i'm not going to school. </s>
i'm thinking of going away for a while. </s>
what's <unk> <unk> </s>
all the <unk> started coming here. </s>
did you know that? </s>
there's a couple of kids from school. </s>
we have very similar <unk> </s>
it's, uh, it's good. </s>
yeah, i do, but believe it or not, you may want to work one day, bill. </s>
your mexican <unk> is nothing to you. </s>

two <unk> </s>
somebody call the <unk> </s>
i'm going to be back to new york soon and i want to put this on its
what does your mother think? </s>
she thinks i made my own decision. </s>
i'm not sure how i feel about this. </s>
we need to talk more about this. </s>
i don't understand why. </s>
i've never talked about it until now, and i know what i want. </s>
johnny, something's wrong. </s>
can you come here and take a look? </s>
that's enough, mr. <unk> </s>
you can come if you like. </s>
is he okay? </s>
yes, fine. </s>
<unk> starts with a <unk> </s>
not yet. </s>
any idea what the problem is? </s>
it could be one of a few things. </s>
i suspect <unk> is <unk> <unk> </s>
the problem is, whether they're good or not. </s>
will this show when you do the <unk> </s>
not exactly. </s>
that's not a good sign. </s>
so it's serious? </s>
i think we should send him to a general <unk> </s>
if it were serious, dad, you wouldn't be <unk> </s>
i can open you right now and <unk> under the <unk> </s>
if it's just a <unk> it's really <unk> </s>
i don't think i should tell my mom that. </s>
if there's nothing there, why <unk> </s>
whatever you say, johnny. </s>
you're the boss. </s>
he told you, didn't he? </s>
of course he did. </s>
then you know there's nothing serious. </s>
if it wasn't serious, you'd have told me yourself. </s>
look, mom, you're going to have to stay away from a potential <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
that's why i didn't tell you. </s>
he says it's just a <unk> </s>
that's right. </s>
a simple operation <unk> </s>
yes, it is. </s>
mom, if anything went wrong, i'd tell you. </s>
sure. </s>
okay. </s>

but he did what he did, just as soon as i hit him. </s>

he was a family man who was willing to <unk> your father's <unk> rights. </s>
i'm sure you had no choice. </s>
i had a <unk> </s>
you broke my promise. </s>
i know my father. </s>
why do you keep your arms <unk> </s>

you can pick him up after <unk> </s>
what do you mean, <unk> </s>
you want to tell me that my father is <unk> </s>
well, of course not, but <unk> speaking there's nothing we can do to him. </s>
if you don't help me get out of the way, you don't go back to <unk> for nothing.

well, i think you're right. </s>
wait till you taste this. </s>
come on, dad. </s>
okay. </s>
hmm, okay. </s>
here. </s>
try this. </s>
come on, dad, take a <unk> </s>
come on, there you go. </s>
let's try <unk> </s>
dad, don't put things in the window. </s>
home <unk> </s>
you don't like it there, do you? </s>
neither did i. </s>
good luck, huh? </s>
come on, dad. </s>
that's better. </s>
okay, dad. </s>
stay that way for a minute and i'll kill you. </s>
i'll take these to <unk> </s>
why are you here, <unk> </s>
why are you here, <unk> </s>
what? </s>
you know, if you're worried about <unk> </s>
where's the <unk> </s>
that's your <unk> dad. </s>
what are you talking about? </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
i'm worried about her. </s>
well, don't worry, dad. </s>
<unk> i'm sure he's okay. </s>
you think so? </s>
yeah. </s>
give me a hand with the <unk> <unk> </s>
it needs to be done now. </s>
look. </s>
what we need now is a good night's sleep. </s>
you always say you have a problem, <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
i mean, there's <unk> now, dad. </s>
let's sit on it. </s>
dad? </s>
dad? </s>
dad? </s>
dad, where are you? </s>
dad? </s>
dad? </s>
dad? </s>
dad? </s>
what do you think you're doing here? </s>
oh, dad, here, let me help you. </s>
come on, dad, come on. </s>
no. </s>
dad, i'm <unk> the bed. </s>
come on. </s>
come on, dad, get out. </s>
dad, come on. </s>
i've got you. </s>
<unk> </s>
come on. </s>
<unk> </s>
i got you, i got you. </s>
i've got you. </s>
mr. <unk> </s>
i understand you brought <unk> back to the hospital. </s>
yeah. </s>
i figured it would be difficult for him to stay home. </s>
that's not the place for him right now. </s>
if you stay at home, you can stay here, right? </s>
maybe we should talk to a lawyer in <unk> </s>
i know what kids say when they say <unk> </s>
you know what that means. </s>
i know what happened to <unk> </s>
mr. <unk> i assume <unk> is also human. </s>
we can handle all the <unk> </s>
every <unk> </s>
we live in a <unk> where old people are finally <unk> </s>
what's your name? </s>
why are you <unk> </s>
there's another doctor in this hospital. </s>
i think he can do better than dr. <unk> </s>
what? </s>
i <unk> everything they said. </s>
he's a good man. </s>
i want a <unk> of her <unk> </s>
mr. <unk> </s>
mr. <unk> </s>
<unk> mr. <unk> </s>
let's make some <unk> </s>
let's get a <unk> and trace the <unk> </s>
give me your <unk> and let's <unk> your vital <unk> </s>
i'm not really sure what caused it, but right now i think it's a <unk> </s>
the question is, what caused it? </s>
and why is there no <unk> </s>
if you want to make any more <unk> about this, just do it. </s>
no, that's not necessary. </s>
well, as we say in <unk> we sit down and do nothing. </s>
<unk> </s>
we've done a series of tests so far, and we'll do more. </s>
so far, the only shot we've got. </s>
i appreciate your <unk> doctor. </s>
but these tests have been done a long time ago, haven't they? </s>
if you stay here a while, <unk> will be able to catch him at all times. </s>
and i'll check in and see him twice a day. </s>
i'm going to move in with him till he <unk> </s>
i'm afraid that's completely <unk> </s>
how long are you going to take this? </s>
i don't know. </s>
i go once a day. </s>
<unk> </s>
i'm talking to him. </s>
i'm coming over and talking. </s>
i thought if i lived there and died i wouldn't have done it. </s>
and what are you going to do with <unk> </s>
<unk> it's <unk> </s>
you're the only one who can make it, john. </s>
why don't you take her to the <unk> </s>
i can't tell you that. </s>
maybe i should be there when it's over. </s>
i don't know. </s>
to prove he's still here. </s>
to prove that i am his son. </s>
so what's the positive so far? </s>
<unk> this man got up every day in his life and went to a <unk> job. </s>
i never trusted him. </s>
he did it because he was <unk> and he had no choice. </s>
you never asked yourself if i was happy or happy. </s>
i never asked if she had the right. </s>
when he <unk> this <unk> he <unk> and <unk> </s>
but i did it <unk> </s>
john. </s>
i couldn't resist him, but my mother <unk> him. </s>
and right now, i'm <unk> </s>
i was upset because i had a marriage that went bad, and i got a job at <unk> and i barely have a son who can barely walk. </s>
maybe this will be hard for me. </s>
but when you die, i will be by your side.
and i killed him, and i covered him. </s>
and at that moment, i <unk> under the <unk> </s>
i owe him that. </s>
when did you get to town? </s>
i've never been. </s>
i'm staying with some friends. </s>
i didn't want to leave <unk> </s>
you come here every day? </s>
when you leave, a nurse calls me. </s>
i'm standing around a half an hour. </s>
i'm <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> dad. </s>
i understand that. </s>
why are you here? </s>
was there an accident or a car accident? </s>
he <unk> </s>
yes, he does. </s>
you sound like a child. </s>
go, uh, dr. <unk> <unk> </s>
please, please. </s>
why are you being so nice to me? </s>
uh, <unk> one of the hospital, dad. </s>
<unk> uh, a <unk> </s>
that's <unk> this is, uh, <unk> </s>
that's my dad. </s>
yes, mr. <unk> </s>
how can i leave you alone? </s>
i took these <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
then we better figure something out. </s>
are you going to starve me here? </s>
okay, first we need some <unk> </s>
remember, i haven't eaten in a long time. </s>
maybe that's why i'm here. </s>
you can't do that, <unk> </s>
all tests are <unk> vital <unk> </s>
this is a healthy human being. </s>
i've seen people come out of <unk> before. </s>
i usually find out why. </s>
there's some <unk> about it. </s>
that <unk> <unk> </s>
like what? </s>
how can we say that the last time we <unk> the <unk> from the <unk> we trust him, and not talk about it? </s>
i see. </s>
you know, when we got home, it was all this <unk> </s>
but in <unk> it became your <unk> and <unk> that <unk> went back to. </s>
i think that's better. </s>
me too. </s>
they're here. </s>
what's going on, dad? </s>
what are you looking for? </s>
your mother and i are living a new life together, johnny. </s>
we need new <unk> </s>
i don't know, dad. </s>
what do you think mom would say about that? </s>
you're probably mad and mad at me, but you're <unk> </s>
i haven't been home in ten years, <unk> </s>
how about that? </s>
thanks. </s>
thank you, thank you. </s>
ladies, ladies, <unk> <unk> </s>
no matter how much you lose during the <unk> you lose your <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and almost a <unk> man, <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
great jake. </s>
i beg you to give him a big <unk> </s>
come on, it's a big <unk> </s>

maybe it's <unk> </s>
this is my <unk> <unk> </s>

i think we should do this more at home. </s>
in fact, i was gonna go see a couple of <unk> but it's not <unk> </s>
that's good to hear, jake. </s>
wait. </s>
there's another one. </s>
i won't ask again. </s>
oh, <unk> <unk> </s>
we can't stop them. </s>
<unk> </s>
<unk> never killed anybody <unk> </s>
but wouldn't that be nice? </s>
i'm telling you, johnny, he's not what he was. </s>
maybe we should give <unk> a <unk> </s>
you know what happens to <unk> </s>
no one believes he's a <unk> who died a few weeks ago. </s>
i mean being with someone. </s>
mom, he's just <unk> </s>
the hole was a golf course, but the <unk> </s>
wonderful day. </s>
after the <unk> they took us somewhere. </s>
that's a good idea. </s>
maybe mom will come along with us. </s>
his <unk> got in the car. </s>
i've run too fast before. </s>
i hate to think about what he loves now. </s>
don't worry about your pretty little head, <unk> </s>
old jake <unk> you'll be safe in <unk> <unk> </s>
and this is gonna be fun. </s>

i want to see if i can still walk away. </s>

this is the second time <unk> has returned to us. </s>
he's worried about us. </s>
<unk> for <unk> means he has nothing to do with this. </s>
good boy. </s>
in the meantime, get out. </s>
why don't you try <unk> that big mouth all the time? </s>
you're the captain of the <unk> team, right? </s>
at least you tried. </s>
<unk> the <unk> you got from <unk> <unk> to <unk> you. </s>
i'm so proud of you. </s>
never hurts to be ready. </s>
if you think <unk> can help you, why not? </s>
i was kidding. </s>
if you want to get to know <unk> <unk> maybe the next time you have her over for dinner you won't ask the rest of us to come along. </s>
i mean, i... </s>
it's that <unk> </s>
i don't think the others noticed. </s>
still, the last thing any of us need to do is be <unk> </s>
office <unk> even under normal <unk> </s>
we live under normal circumstances. </s>
what are the odds of any of us finding someone who can deal with things that we have to deal with?
i don't know, maybe it's <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
i actually wanted to be alone. </s>
<unk> tell him to get off her. </s>
this murder happened a week ago. </s>
why are you telling me this now? </s>
how did you get these? </s>
the police sent these to you? </s>
they usually wear these when the victim is important. </s>
he said she <unk> him. </s>
i was trying to make him proud. </s>
it actually worked. </s>
<unk> look who's here 20 minutes before the crime scene. </s>
what? </s>
okay, nice guy. </s>
and who is it? </s>
are you sure it's him? </s>
if we can find one of <unk> <unk> we can see his face. </s>
yeah, that's him. </s>
now we know why the <unk> woman died to me. </s>
he died because of me. </s>
if <unk> is somehow responsible for this, then so am i. </s>
<unk> </s>
hey. </s>
whatever you're doing now, you're not responsible for this, and neither am i. </s>
but i know who he is. </s>
you seem a little <unk> <unk> </s>
long day at the office. </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
i did this! </s>
i know some of his powers can't be <unk> </s>
billy was totally mad at me, and you believed him. </s>
this <unk> is the most important part of the country. </s>
east <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> wouldn't do anything to them. </s>
it's not like some <unk> <unk> </s>
stay out of trouble. </s>
i don't think <unk> <unk> would be much better. </s>
how about we sneak in and pretend we're <unk> </s>
so, you want to be next? </s>
i think we should stay here. </s>
why didn't you call me when you were <unk> </s>
as far as i know, <unk> has <unk> </s>
i've never loved a woman in my life. </s>
i just love <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
really? </s>
you scared me. </s>
we're taking you in for <unk> </s>
<unk> read him his rights. </s>
who are you? </s>
nobody. </s>
there's a woman i've never told you about my <unk> <unk> </s>
yeah, for 12 million dollars we could <unk> a prison <unk> in <unk> </s>
yes, but for how long? </s>
an <unk> <unk> of <unk> in a demon <unk> couldn't do much, so my guess, regular <unk> not really a problem. </s>
<unk> what are you going to do? </s>
you can't just walk into a police station and wait for <unk> </s>
there's been an accident. </s>
before i hit him, i had no idea what that woman was doing in <unk> </s>
it's not a bad idea to be able to come by and visit a patient at the hospital. </s>
<unk> some of the blood is his. </s>
not human. </s>
he's headed this way. </s>
we'll take a sample and see what kind of billy is. </s>
i'll take care of a <unk> </s>
<unk> daily <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
i don't think you should do this. </s>
how could i <unk> </s>
i managed to get <unk> blood <unk> </s>
maybe we can find out what demon is and how the <unk> works. </s>
will you send me the glass <unk> </s>
thank you. </s>
will you invite me in? </s>
please, come in. </s>
i want you to tell me about <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> tell me everything. </s>
what makes you think i'd do that? </s>
after all, it's your fault. </s>
i know a thing or two about <unk> </s>
<unk> side by side. </s>
<unk> feels responsible for this boy because he brought him back to <unk> </s>
i feel responsible because he did it to save me. </s>
in fact, you're totally responsible for this... for nothing, because you're a <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> this spring is not <unk> </s>
billy <unk> <unk> people. </s>
then why did you choose <unk> </s>
others can take hours. </s>
god, <unk> i hope you're starting to feel <unk> </s>
really <unk> </s>
i have to find <unk> </s>
and i can't help you, why? </s>
do you remember the guy you hired to get into <unk> </s>
you know, what he did to me, what did he look like? </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
it's about <unk> </s>
there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop it. </s>
your life can be destroyed by someone else. </s>
and if a woman is strong enough, she'll never be able to <unk> her <unk> <unk> </s>
where's <unk> </s>
i understand why 14 years of <unk> did this. </s>
there's a reason, am i right? </s>
how many times do you want to talk to <unk> <unk> </s>
did i wake you? </s>
he probably left behind telling her how to drive. </s>
you know these <unk> </s>
probably deserved it. </s>
like i said, </s>
<unk> <unk> here. </s>
hey, <unk> </s>
billy. </s>
i didn't know you were having a party. </s>
i thought we agreed that you weren't going to come here anymore. </s>
do you want to, or should i? </s>
some of the <unk> seem to be <unk> strong. </s>
these are probably from <unk> demon <unk> </s>
then it seems that <unk> is <unk> the people of <unk> </s>
which means it could be <unk> by <unk> or even <unk> </s>
<unk> where's <unk> <unk> </s>
when <unk> got out, <unk> thought he was coming out because he was sleeping with her. </s>
well, i <unk> </s>
you lie to me again, we're gonna have a serious problem. </s>
sit down, <unk> </s>
there's something we need to talk about. </s>
i'm sorry i didn't tell you <unk> left. </s>
we still have to make some changes around here. </s>
change can be good, i guess. </s>
the <unk> <unk> is like <unk> now. </s>
<unk> </s>
maybe your mom and dad never told you what grown men are going through. </s>
you can't come in here all the time, <unk> like this. </s>
he actually forced me to pick him up. </s>
is that what you want? </s>
stop it. </s>
you stand up now? </s>
you put your hair back on the back, close your eyes and then join us in <unk> </s>
you think you can do anything you want to get in the middle of a place because you belong to life? </s>
no. </s>
i'll show you blood. </s>
what do you call a woman with two eyes on her <unk> </s>
nothing you say twice already. </s>
no sense of humor. </s>
to be honest, i'm calling to kill that <unk> </s>
come in. </s>
you have to know the rules about billy. </s>
everybody in <unk> knows these rules. </s>
you leave him alone with your girlfriend and you never let him touch you. </s>
when you want money, drop the table and <unk> </s>
can you tell me something? </s>
why did you invite me in after you told me i wanted to kill <unk> </s>
you're <unk> right? </s>
billy mention me? </s>
she said a <unk> guy named <unk> would come here sooner or later. </s>
that <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
i know what you're doing. </s>
who he is. </s>
you scared me. </s>
he forced me to find you. </s>
like a <unk> game. </s>
you <unk> me with your <unk> <unk> </s>
but you'll never know, will you? </s>
no, you just keep running and running away. </s>
guess what, <unk> i'm not one of your new <unk> <unk> </s>
i'm a <unk> </s>
you showed up, didn't you? </s>
no, <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
you and <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> eat this. </s>
just a <unk> </s>
the real problem is <unk> </s>
why are you telling me this? </s>
do i know you? </s>
i thought we should leave. </s>
the burning <unk> were tortured and tortured to get you out. </s>
i see. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> woman needs to <unk> all the <unk> that were done to him. </s>
no, asshole. </s>
i'm here to take you back. </s>
i mean, of course, you women sell themselves for money and <unk> but men are just as bad. </s>
maybe even worse. </s>
<unk> <unk> even <unk> <unk> for what's under your <unk> </s>
i don't wear pants. </s>
in fact, i'm lucky to have an arrow in my <unk> </s>
and a <unk> <unk> </s>
i don't think so. </s>
you don't have the balls to do it. </s>
<unk> again. </s>
you won't hurt me. </s>
no, i won't hurt her. </s>
i won't hurt her. </s>
here. </s>
i would say <unk> hand <unk> blood is <unk> </s>
you mean the prints on the <unk> downstairs are <unk> blood? </s>
are you saying i should take it in my hand and make it look like some <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
even though i can't live like this, it <unk> me. </s>
i'd better get out of here. </s>
lock the door behind me. </s>
maybe the plan was <unk> </s>
oh, god. </s>
you said you would plan <unk> but what's plan <unk> </s>

about how stupid you are. </s>
after five years of living in a <unk> i believe i went out to be safe, little dark places as <unk> </s>
let's finish this. </s>
i'm sorry, <unk> </s>
you're sorry? </s>
you were right about me loving dark places for <unk> </s>
but you also forget i love <unk> <unk> </s>
i don't either. </s>
i mean, you're a <unk> but why the hell would <unk> <unk> you? </s>
maybe because i'm not human. </s>
and a vampire never <unk> </s>
you know those things that the <unk> show up? </s>
it was always about pain and pleasure. </s>
i think your <unk> <unk> makes you less <unk> than humans. </s>
like a noble person. </s>
i mean, being <unk> <unk> really <unk> </s>
strange. </s>
what? </s>
they're out there <unk> <unk> and they're also <unk> </s>
i understand that. </s>

i don't know what kind of man i am anymore. </s>
i know. </s>

the days after the <unk> were filled with <unk> </s>

and to say hello to <unk> in front of a <unk> <unk> </s>
you really can't be thinking about taking this offer. </s>
<unk> wants to know what he knows about <unk> because he doesn't deserve to be <unk> </s>
and when the time comes, we can get revenge for those who have hurt us. </s>
we keep our own <unk> <unk> </s>
and to <unk> the right <unk> of death. </s>

<unk> can make beautiful <unk> music. </s>
i won't let you play ball and listen to this music. </s>
like <unk> </s>

are you sure you don't want to close your eyes and go <unk> </s>
no, because i'm <unk> that's <unk> </s>
goodbye then. </s>
can i have another beer? </s>
she was looking for her boyfriend. </s>
he's not my boyfriend, <unk> </s>
she told me she was worried about you. </s>

<unk> won't work without you. </s>
you don't belong here. </s>
why? </s>
i can't help you, stupid. </s>
there are fewer <unk> </s>
don't pay me. </s>
why pay for sex? </s>
you can't have someone who really loves you. </s>
i don't want to love anybody, understand? </s>
to find the right person. </s>
i'm not right for anybody, <unk> </s>
come on. </s>
<unk> it's <unk> okay? </s>
i like men, don't you see? </s>
go away! </s>
go! </s>
why? </s>
i can't hear you. </s>
remember when you got home late and you looked like a <unk> and you still <unk> me? </s>
yes, i remember. </s>
i spoke to <unk> today. </s>
you know, normal life. </s>
okay. </s>
i'll have something to do tomorrow. </s>
<unk> i'll be right in. </s>
you want <unk> </s>
i want you to go to bed with me. </s>
and i'm telling you i'm gonna clean up first. </s>
<unk> </s>
<unk> not helping you deal with your brother? </s>

all they do is fuck all day. </s>
<unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
i found <unk> <unk> in the <unk> </s>
<unk> if you don't like <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> all kinds of <unk> </s>
come on, pick it up. </s>
a <unk> </s>
come on. </s>
and one for me. </s>
it tastes good, doesn't it? </s>
i feel different when i was a kid. </s>
<unk> don't like football <unk> or anything like that. </s>
because if you're fat and <unk> no one can tell you why you're acting like everyone else. </s>
no one will ever notice i'm gay. </s>
but i didn't deliver this <unk> to the <unk> special <unk> </s>
they let me <unk> <unk> </s>
and they gave me <unk> </s>
there was this incredibly handsome <unk> who begged me to stop him from being <unk> </s>
i don't know how much <unk> makes me happy, when i get stuck in a <unk> <unk> or when he's taking <unk> </s>
first <unk> is a <unk> </s>
i'm tired of being gay. </s>
really. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
and that's not me. </s>
i've been waiting all night for <unk> </s>
go. </s>
you'll have to pay me anyway. </s>
i'm a <unk> </s>
it's the worst <unk> of all time. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
i'm a <unk> </s>
<unk> aren't supposed to be bad. </s>
we always talked about something we weren't ready for. </s>
so it's better to get away with them than to see where they lead us. </s>
because most <unk> are the answer we're looking for. </s>
put your hands on the <unk> </s>
close your eyes. </s>
let's all breathe together. </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
breathe, breathe. </s>
i thought it was my <unk> but it was okay. </s>
we all have <unk> </s>
the first step we need to <unk> what we want or what we want to do. </s>
i don't know about you, but <unk> </s>
i did it on purpose. </s>
i'm <unk> </s>
<unk> but <unk> </s>
you can run, but i can't lose you. </s>
i warned you, but you didn't. </s>
i warned you, but you didn't. </s>
<unk> but what do you like? </s>
are you doing because you want to, or because you want to keep acting like everything's <unk> </s>
society wants you to be fat. </s>
if they do, everyone will feel better, because they feel <unk> </s>
not anymore. </s>
it's time to take the first step. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
one move, <unk> </s>
but one day of <unk> isn't enough. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> gives you the support you need on the long, hard road. </s>
believe me, there's only one way to find out. </s>
let's move on to stage 3. </s>
