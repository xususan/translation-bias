i guess there are some things you can't tell your father. 
<unk> george <unk> thought he wanted the <unk> <unk> <unk> to give him his <unk> 
there's nothing wrong with that. 
but i have to tell you a little bit about my feelings for that. 
<unk> will do the same for you. 
<unk> will do the same for you. 
someday you're gonna find the right woman to carry out this mission. 
but until then, i'll be right across the hall.

and michael, after <unk> broke up with two girls, she met <unk> 
hey, <unk> is it my <unk> or is this <unk> room the same <unk> as our <unk> 
i think he's very <unk> to you. 
i used to think it was because i was thinking about what it was
besides, i'm not gonna take a job like this with someone just because my son wants it. 
i'm mrs. <unk> <unk> 
<unk> there is no <unk> in the <unk> of life that can be <unk> by <unk> <unk>

michael took a step in <unk> for years. 
well, do you think that's a good idea? 
i think that's a great idea. 
<unk> 
that's a great idea. 
but how do we get in there if we can't get everybody out?
this may not be the best idea i've ever had. 
i'm sorry, michael. 
i'm sorry, michael, but it looks like we're <unk> 
you took someone i love. 
i took someone you love. 
i'm <unk> <unk> 
listen, i know you're trying to get back at me for <unk> 
i wasn't lying when i said i wasn't going to sleep with her, so...

really, i had a chance to get rid of her. 
it's okay. 
<unk> 
who's <unk> <unk>

i wanted to talk to you about something, but first i didn't know you were real. 
but now... <unk> 
yes, i did it for her. 
oh. 
<unk> loves <unk> 
but, you know, i'm sure she'll be interested in him. 
i'm sure <unk> will be fine. 
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her. 
about <unk> 
i mean, you can take him to his <unk> 
hi, george michael. 
i'm gonna go home and think about it. 
i'm gonna go home and watch <unk> <unk> 
dad, what are we doing here? 
michael knew he had a moral reason to tell his son the truth. 
yeah. 
uncle <unk> will take care of him. 
well, why would he do that? 
why did you choose my moral <unk> 
you and i know that, but <unk> <unk> 
<unk> is not a good <unk> and he can shoot almost everywhere. 
you know, but listen, did you really think that was <unk> 
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think? 
we don't even know how old she is. 
nobody knows. 
he was <unk> the young girls in different <unk> and i thought i'd go up to the <unk> and go up to him and do the... 
<unk> would you like to dance? 
and she said, <unk> what <unk> 
i did it in front of the <unk> but... 
but, you know, <unk> <unk> dance or something.

you must surrender. 
come here. 
open up! 
if you think we're going to <unk> 
open the door. 
but he'll kill us. 
too many demons in one room. 
the only way out of here is to deliver it alive. 
you think i want to get out? 
how many people can die in this room, <unk> 
my name is <unk> 
your <unk> 
no one asked you to work for them, <unk> 
if you were a <unk> 
i think <unk> <unk> made it clear. 
i'm <unk> general <unk> 
kill me and kill <unk> 
otherwise, you're nothing but a dead <unk> 
no one's going to see you as a hero. 
by the time we're done, you'll be a <unk> <unk> 
we'll give them a couple of <unk> <unk> and give them free <unk> for <unk> <unk> 
we know you very well, don't we, <unk> 
wait, wait, wait. 
i <unk> the <unk> 
but... 
you fucking <unk> 
i thought we were going to start a higher <unk> 
sorry about your wife's death, <unk> 
i know what this can do to you. 
is that supposed to stop me? 
it's okay. 
stop! 
why did you bring him here? 
i made a choice. 
without plan b. 
why do you think i kept you out of that room? 
people are still <unk> harry. 
the <unk> are less than the ones who die. 
how do you make a choice like that? 
that's my job. 
<unk> <unk> can you come out to play? 
hello, <unk> 
finally, it comes down to who says the longest <unk> 
right? 
i would never have <unk> that morning if i hadn't stopped <unk> 
you gave <unk> an order to <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> didn't you? 
that's why you're a lonely <unk> 
no need to worry. 
to be <unk> by a foreign power and sacrifice your own lives to be <unk> 
americans would have made you general director no doubt. 
how many more lives will you spend on that <unk> 
<unk> what you think is <unk> <unk> 
the service is dying. 
but if i realized i was on the losing side, my career would be too short. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i think it came from you. 
what's this? 
<unk> <unk> can cause more than six hours or <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
how <unk> 
i was afraid that would be the answer. 
that's why i took the chance to make a choice. 
it's not <unk> <unk> 
i ate <unk> <unk> 
say you're lying, harry. 
please. 
tell me you didn't betray <unk> 
it's been four hours, <unk> 
you spend the last two hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd get out of that pretty <unk> 
i'm thinking. 
your letter said something to me. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
you can't go anymore. 
i have something that should be yours. 
your father was wearing this the night he died. 
<unk> found a way to <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> in a place where they can <unk> and <unk> and <unk> 
the night of the <unk> did you wear a wedding ring? 
you're lucky you're not good enough, <unk> 
after <unk> <unk> 
you <unk> 
<unk> not going to last forever, will. 
then who <unk> 
they're like me. 
it would really help if we could get rid of <unk> and <unk> men. 
there's room for every <unk> in <unk> <unk> 
one line is <unk> <unk> 
these new problems kill in the dark. 
these people will be grateful to you. 
i think we should wait here to keep them safe, but i worry that things will get worse. 
they have no idea who caused the dark <unk> 
besides, it's not what <unk> in the dark we need to worry about. 
how do you plan on <unk> this <unk> <unk> 
maybe it's a <unk> 
this is the last <unk> of <unk> <unk> 
i may need your <unk> and a new job. 
it's under <unk> but for beauty <unk> it's more than just a <unk> 
try to fix it. 
we talked about this. 
it's almost impossible to destroy the <unk> that <unk> <unk> him. 
sure, i just need <unk> information that i don't have. 
i'm gonna need a team. 
any idea what's going on? 
but there's a bad <unk> 
it's the only way i can get back to <unk> 
and because of the problem with the <unk> it was hard to drive. 
an <unk> to help fix the electric <unk> 
he <unk> as soon as he found out. 
if things didn't work out, i had to go to his <unk> 
what the hell do you think you're doing? 
<unk> <unk> the killer is out there somewhere. 
and i think he really wants to prove to you that he wants to help. 
well, whatever the reason, just keep an eye on him for me, okay? 
because neither of us have anything to do with new <unk> 
i'm not saying it's because it's my mom. 
when you leave i'll search the person in school who caused the dark <unk> 
he was <unk> and <unk> us. 
there was no choice, <unk> 
that's the third time in two weeks. 
now this is the serial killer <unk> 
all right, i'll go talk to <unk> 
dad always said you were a good man. 
<unk> father? 
there might be a way, but you can feel a lot more scary if you want to, so let's not do this.
i can't even find <unk> <unk> <unk> 
you're telling me you can't find a town with <unk> <unk> 
that didn't cause any trouble. 
then why didn't we use <unk> to finish the <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
so how do we find him? 
a box of <unk> left behind by <unk> <unk> 
i don't think i need <unk> <unk> and <unk> is just the first <unk> 
<unk> said you'd find him. 
it's easy for <unk> to <unk> but sometimes things aren't what they <unk> 
i got a town to run. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
guys, i'd love to, but i've never done anything like this before. 
i can't even afford to park the car to take care of you, but i don't have the money to pay for oil <unk> 
if all goes well, i'll be back with my <unk> <unk> 
that's <unk> husband, <unk> 
there's enough panic and fear. 
the same person murdered my son 27 years ago? 
we call it <unk> <unk> <unk> 
what else do you expect of me, <unk> 
<unk> is doing his best to get the rules <unk> but he's not the type to kill people. 
it's the same thing as <unk> <unk> 
thanks to our friend there, we're keeping them in a prison of some kind. 
<unk> <unk> says he's working. 
damn, <unk> must have <unk> the <unk> energy <unk> 
that explains why the <unk> <unk> in town. 
this is <unk> five minutes or so. 
this is all we need to do in the dark. 
here, we can <unk> the <unk> <unk> to <unk> faster than the <unk> but there's nothing more we can do. 
you better run. 
help each other. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> i'm happy here. 
i got your message. 
get in the car. 
come on, <unk> 
the war <unk> ahead of us, they won't even believe it. 
i don't think there's anything worse than being in love. 
<unk> <unk> 
there are two sides to every story. 
whoever is behind this, is a <unk> 
let's go. 
<unk> <unk> asked me to represent him. 
<unk> you are my brother's <unk> 
that's why he's my brother <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in bigger places. 
none of them were killed by a woman. 
i gave you a second person to <unk> and you were <unk> in <unk> 
and then, friends and <unk> take care of <unk> 
no <unk> here. 
my mother and others will join you. 
<unk> this is <unk> <unk> 
do <unk> always have to be <unk> 
i don't really understand this stuff. 
but i do know that you must be <unk> 
don't listen to him. 
this marriage is <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
what do you do? 
<unk> 
then i shall see you above the wall. 
and who are you? 
<unk> is a <unk> 
like i said, i have business to attend to. 
we need to learn how to handle it. 
<unk> said i couldn't accept a present. 
then it stays with us. 
when the wedding comes, every bride is beautiful. 
remember, this is our fault. 
sit down. 
we'll take what we <unk> from the <unk> 
he doesn't want to talk. 
all right. 
<unk> <unk> it's time. 
are you gonna be the second person to get the <unk> 
for the play. 
we need to talk. 
we need <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> 
if we don't <unk> the <unk> it may be <unk> 
<unk> 
come on, <unk> 
for old time's sake. 
dress <unk> <unk> 
i'm so sorry. 
just a little <unk> 
that's all. 
we'll help <unk> give <unk> his <unk> 
sounds easy. 
<unk> 
open the door! 
<unk> you rotten <unk>

<unk> 
you broke your arm. 
come on! 
<unk> 
quiet, <unk> sleeping. 
is this <unk> <unk> 
i don't understand why you want to marry <unk> <unk> 
i don't think so. 
put aside your <unk> and do your best for everyone. 
would you put aside your <unk> for others? 
that's what we all have to do. 
if someone is willing to spend their whole life <unk> to others, then they are not. 
it must be pretty <unk> to think like that. 
try. 
either way, tell me the truth. 
only then can you look at each other and light a fire in the <unk> 
then you'll be husband and wife. 
have you ever loved anyone? 
no. 
before i got here... 
do you want to be <unk> 
tell <unk> we're done with him. 
<unk> 
come on! 
get out! 
you killed him. 
we're not done here. 
don't you understand? 
i was going to betray my mother and protect <unk> <unk> 
this woman was sent here to kill you! 
i don't know. 
if you say so. 
i killed my brother. 
he was the one who should have been with him today. 
even if the world was <unk> <unk> had everything. 
people love him because they do. 
<unk> called him his first child. 
<unk> <unk> 
then you had the opportunity to get out of there, <unk> 
i don't need anything! 
<unk> <unk> but him. 
<unk> 
after i killed him. 
<unk> i can't tell anybody what happened here today and what happened. 
or stay. 
it's <unk> but it's <unk> 
he went to bed the other night. 
but you don't know who <unk> was talking to. 
light the fire with me. 
you want to be a <unk> 
i can help you. 
<unk> versus <unk> 
<unk> i'm sick of you, <unk> 
with this <unk> you're the <unk> 
<unk> has broken every rule of these rules. 
the life of a killer without blood is <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
all <unk> <unk> to the <unk> will be <unk> by the <unk> 
what right does he have to go fishing <unk> 
and i can't risk your life to catch <unk> every summer. 
that reminds me of <unk> 
<unk> is the most <unk> need of you. 
<unk> 
i've heard enough. 
you're late for <unk> 
some think they're gonna kill him again. 
but if you <unk> the <unk> will be inside the <unk> and not hungry. 
<unk> is wanted for murder, you know that. 
kill him! 
kill me now, <unk> 
i'm <unk> 
do it without any <unk> we're all going to die. 
he hired us to deliver <unk> to the <unk> after <unk> 
you're talking about the guy who helped him escape the first time? 
so let's not make this <unk> 
but we have the <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> as we speak. 
when did you learn to <unk> young women? 
what do you mean? 
for too long, you've been <unk> <unk> 
remember who you're talking to.

the boy asks for the life of his brother, life or blood money. 
i didn't mean to kill anyone. 
hurry! 
thanks. 
<unk> fell in love with her. 
he's looking for some <unk> he thinks he has money, and then he <unk> the money, this asshole. 
he left my mother and took everything with him with him. 
my brother came after you. 
but it cost you your life. 
<unk> is it true?

<unk> <unk> 
<unk> wants to take my place on the <unk> just to take my place. 
you failed me, <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> 
you don't understand. 
tell <unk> <unk> that you want to save <unk> <unk> <unk> 
so tell me you don't believe in <unk> 
say it. 
i'm sorry. 
i knew you killed one of my <unk> but you didn't tell me the story. 
it's just his <unk> 
<unk> nobody's ever said bad things about you. 
that's all i got. 
did you bring it? 
there's no 50 silver here. 
not enough. 
and i'm going to keep that <unk> <unk> 
was there enough money? 
<unk>

<unk> i want to fight <unk> 
<unk> was attacked and i <unk> you.

the view was more like <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i know i let you down. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
but there are <unk> 
you can't just <unk> into one of your own <unk> 
this <unk> needs a <unk> 
<unk> the <unk> 
a <unk> that will <unk> control. 
you're under arrest for <unk> <unk> for the fact that <unk> <unk> has <unk> 
what's the point of having <unk> all of us? 
we are here to <unk> the <unk> <unk> 
<unk> to <unk> <unk> 
it's <unk> 
a new <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
get up. 
<unk>

i'm not playing this game. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
this can't end here. 
from now on, we'll work just like my dad <unk> 
i didn't mean to <unk> 
a good <unk> 
a great <unk> needs a powerful army. 
we don't have to share a bed, but if we share a room, people will talk. 
<unk> always liked this place. 
looks like you've never seen it. 
if i tell my mother the truth, i will lose her
and i also had a chance to get away. 
what about <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
i trust you. 
the decision you make will be <unk> 
and when i do, i'll be there.

<unk> 
come on, hurry up!

people shouldn't leave their precious things lying down. 
you owe mom an apology. 
but i'm a <unk> and it's a <unk> 
so i'll take your life.

<unk> 
i didn't need your help.

there's a <unk> about us. 
<unk> greatest <unk> <unk> 
even the sword <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> 
who's <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
we need to <unk> the <unk> 
<unk> 
<unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
this time, <unk> us. 
<unk> 
today we return to our <unk> and ask for more <unk> and <unk> religious <unk> 
like less talk about <unk> <unk> soviet <unk> or <unk> <unk> 
it's a <unk> situation for people that makes things <unk> especially in <unk> 
it can cause serious problems which are perfectly <unk> within itself. 
we make fun of those people, and the whole world <unk> with us. 
richard <unk> and i have come up with this problem in a <unk> <unk> 
maybe we need to be more <unk> with richard. 
especially with <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> 
i was sure it was just like <unk> said. 
you like bad guys. 
you don't want to write a book like that, <unk> 
but, of course, what would a <unk> do then? 
what <unk> 
how <unk> it is to do that to the people who think <unk> and <unk> are somehow <unk> 
<unk> for many people, is like moral <unk> 
well, if that's true, if religion does help people lead moral lives, then one should take very seriously the <unk> that we're just going to stand here and let the devil take the <unk> 
because <unk> can stay with many people, and <unk> is the <unk> of these people. 
a lot of people would have meant something, and that's where they came from. 
yeah, but there's got to be something better than <unk> 
yeah, there's definitely hope. 
let's see what happens. 
of course. 
at least i can <unk> my <unk> 
i don't know how to tell you this. 
i'm the <unk> man in the world. 
all right, knock it off. 
i'm the <unk> man in the world. 
okay, you won this. 
i can't find <unk> <unk> 
honey, just so you know, you can't return a baby without even <unk> 
i need to find the paper that <unk> gave me when he <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i finally got back to my <unk> responsible for my <unk> health <unk> 
i haven't talked to him since the night we met.

how much do you think i <unk> 
but i... 
even though i didn't know them in time and they didn't have <unk> <unk> and i may or may not have only one of them. 
we're all just worried that the new baby is coming, and i'm <unk> 
listen, <unk> we're gonna make sure that this <unk> doesn't happen again.

of course you still love <unk> 
i ruined her <unk> <unk> 
it's not a birthday party, but the rest of the time she loves you. 
i am brave enough to lose my <unk> and if you're so concerned with me, maybe you don't deserve to take <unk> on your own. 
if it makes you feel any better, we do a lot of the work. 
i can imagine how difficult it must have been for you to <unk> 
no matter how great or funny or amazing you thought it was gonna be, at the end of the day, i knew you

i know <unk> 
he wasn't the type to kill himself. 
he's not a coward. 
she wouldn't have done that to her kid and she wouldn't have done it to
and i'll write a proper note. 
someone better know what to do if we go after <unk> 
there's only one way to find out. 
he was <unk> 
i've never dreamed of such <unk> <unk> 
thank god you said something about <unk> 
all he has to do is <unk> him. 
i think it's definitely good on you, <unk> 
good evening, girls.

i came here to <unk> <unk> 
last time i <unk> i had some information. 
we don't want to hear anything from you. 
leave <unk> 
oh, <unk> you <unk> 
i felt terrible the other day. 
but recent events have caused <unk> <unk> 
i lost mom. 
very sudden and... <unk> 
very <unk> <unk> 
it's a terrible <unk> for anyone who <unk> their mother. 
it was. 
yeah. 
and it made me realize that i need to leave <unk> alone. 
but i think you should know i met a man. 
actually, i got your message. 
i can't imagine how <unk> it would be to marry you. 
if i could handle everything, i would. 
i came to pay my <unk> 
i know i took my chances. 
i'm not half the man you <unk> 
but i asked myself. 
<unk> what do you have to do to support these <unk> you love so much? 
and then i thought of you and that's why i couldn't find a proper man, and that's why i knew all about your new friend. 
and it broke my heart because your <unk> <unk> was a <unk> 
we don't need to see this. 
what's wrong with you? 
you're a pain in the ass and i'm too old to trust you. 
<unk> then. 
i did what i could. 
my mother always said that if a woman <unk> she'd never <unk> 
who is it? 
son. 
here. 
<unk> 
what's that? 
<unk> 
i'd hate to see you <unk> your <unk> 
who are you? 
my name is <unk> <unk> 
i've come to make you your new hands. 
okay? 
<unk> is an old friend of <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
no, thanks. 
i saw some <unk> soldiers holding <unk> 
they got these fancy <unk> 
i'm not talking about <unk> but at least i can get on my own. 
and i don't need to take a <unk> for the rest of my life. 
let me tell you something more <unk> than <unk> <unk> 
i'm not <unk> 
look. 
see? 
and so is the other. 
<unk> saved my life. 
your mother would have <unk> you and left you on the street. 
i wouldn't be stupid if i hadn't met him. 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> 
no! 
a <unk> <unk> 
and <unk> a <unk> you know. 
don't rush the other one now. 
for two years, 
<unk> marry me. 
she taught me <unk> 
and dance <unk> 
then <unk> fell. 
<unk> <unk> 
you were supposed to die while you were still alive. 
plan <unk> 
how do you look into the eyes when you know that <unk> is free? 
you were supposed to call. 
one by one. 
aah! 
finally, <unk> <unk> 
ah, <unk> <unk> 
dr. <unk> <unk> 
a <unk> <unk> 
you should know that my <unk> is <unk> too. 
killing him took me too personal. 
<unk> 
he tortured me. 
he put me in a cell and tortured me again, and again. 
how could i <unk> 
i lived in <unk> for the rest of the war. 
then he went to america, <unk> 
and for years, i called miss <unk> 
but i couldn't answer. 
if you love him so much, and you don't know where he is, why don't you go and see <unk> 
<unk> <unk> but... 
<unk> <unk> 
there's nothing <unk> inside of me. 
but, uh... 
nice <unk> 
nice <unk> 
i know about <unk> and it might be hard to make changes for a <unk> show. 
and it has nothing to do with the <unk> 
this is for <unk> 
it looks so normal. 
i think we should <unk> it after we have certain evidence. 
what about <unk> 
it says he killed his wife. 
you're letting <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> i have something to hide. 
we don't want to <unk> anymore. 
why? 
we were just <unk> 
maybe when you hear the <unk> you'll be <unk>

in the great <unk> the president of the united states of <unk> and crazy <unk> <unk> <unk> black <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> <unk> 
after the <unk> of little <unk> the united states chose a way to starve and <unk> the <unk> of the united states government. 
hold the <unk> 
but despite the <unk> <unk> of the united states <unk> the <unk> was getting worse. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> and crazy <unk> <unk> 
you're a man with a strong heart. 
but i'm tired. 
<unk> 
the indian americans were destroyed by <unk> and <unk> despite their <unk> 
in those times it took a chance to get there and get rich. 
a lot of men and women were <unk> 
the golden <unk> was the first country to save the united states from global <unk> 
the solution was <unk> 
there were a lot of <unk> in <unk> mexican <unk> 
but it was impossible to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> until the <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> that was given to <unk> <unk> cost the eastern <unk> 40 bucks a <unk> 
the <unk> have bought most of the <unk> <unk> <unk> 
these <unk> <unk> are incredibly <unk> 
we're talking about millions of <unk> <unk> <unk> thousands of and thousands of <unk> <unk> 
in new <unk> one of <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> to one of <unk> <unk> <unk> 
his story started <unk> miles away. 
billy never knew his father. 
<unk> lived in new york with her mom at the <unk> 
for years, the <unk> <unk> stopped. 
what do you want? 
<unk> 
drop the bottle. 
we had different cowboy <unk> 
i was always on the corner. 
you have to be careful, <unk> 
billy used what he did best. 
billy the kid was a real <unk> 
<unk> used every dollar for practice. 
in a place like this, only the powerful are alive. 
where are you going? 
<unk> 
only the <unk> 
this belongs to john <unk> 
then john <unk> can come and get <unk> back. 
it's your fault you let me go. 
i don't think so. 
i don't think you have a choice. 
young <unk> <unk> billy the <unk> has been <unk> by a farm owner he's trying to steal from. 
most people sleep where their <unk> <unk> 
you still haven't told me who you work for. 
i don't work for anyone. 
<unk> everyone works for someone, son. 
yeah, but i'm not. 
you treat me like a man who can take what he wants. 
you're right. 
there's only one problem, so am i. 
you have a lot of men. 
you got room for one more? 
when billy the kid came to <unk> he needed a job. 
john <unk> needed <unk> 
john henry <unk> came to the west to make a fortune. 
money <unk> lincoln <unk> <unk> 
but this <unk> <unk> some powerful men. 
lincoln was one of the most <unk> <unk> in the <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> everything from government <unk> 
even the law is their own <unk> 
most of the <unk> in <unk> <unk> them as <unk> 
john henry <unk> stuck his nose in the <unk> that has been in town for a long time. 
no one's <unk> 
<unk> john henry <unk> has become a <unk> man. 
within a few months, the young <unk> <unk> became the most trusted <unk> 
for the first time in his life, he looked like a <unk> <unk> 
<unk> was a <unk> to billy the kid. 
<unk> <unk> billy. 
thanks. 
i'm starving. 
everything is going great, son. 
i'm glad you're here. 
thanks. 
billy hardly ever <unk> 
i was <unk> by a lot of people. 
for a <unk> year old, that was an incredible and <unk> thing. 
while billy the kid is now a part of the <unk> <unk> company that's <unk> america's <unk> several hundred miles to <unk> one man is doing everything he can. 
calm down, gentlemen. 
my left hand as a <unk> <unk> 
we wouldn't be here today if you hadn't done that. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
when they took us to the <unk> <unk> they actually took the soul. 
you can trust me. 
he's talking to me. 
god <unk> 
this is called <unk> <unk> 
but i think they wanted to make us <unk> 
there was a <unk> 
kill <unk> and kill people. 
if you destroy <unk> <unk> you will become a better person. 
they think we're <unk> 
<unk> knew that <unk> had to <unk> for the people of <unk> 
<unk> we're happy here. 
"i'm not happy here. 
living on the <unk> <unk> 
<unk> you are not a <unk> for life. 
give it time. 
i'm sure you'll get over it. 
after the <unk> of the united states <unk> <unk> <unk> began to <unk> a new indian <unk> <unk> 
the united states was <unk> with crazy <unk> 
a <unk> from crazy <unk> wants to kill a <unk> 
united states government was arrested for <unk> a new <unk> 
as fear of crazy <unk> he went to meet the <unk> to clear the name of <unk> <unk> 
crazy <unk> <unk> president of the united states. 
you'll notice the <unk> of the situation. 
they wanted to put him in a prison cell. 
then he took off the <unk> 
in spite of all different <unk> i think the most trusted <unk> <unk> is that the white u.s. <unk> <unk> him. 
crazy horse fought on the <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> from the <unk> 
on september <unk> <unk> crazy horse, a man who fought his entire life to protect his people and won battle after battle against the united states. 
crazy <unk> death is so hard to talk about because it's so hard to believe in all these years. 
one of the things that's most fascinating about crazy horse and his <unk> is simply the fact that of all the many indian <unk> across american history, he's one of the few people that most <unk>
<unk> to the united states <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
i think that's why he's so strong. 
in the death of crazy <unk> the people of <unk> <unk> were a leader of <unk> <unk> 
until the house <unk> <unk> his debt <unk> he <unk> himself. 
this is for you. 
what about <unk> 
i'm not interested in how you feel. 
just the results. 
understood. 
go check it out. 
you stay here. 
okay. 
what's up, guys? 
we heard <unk> 
really? 
don't do anything stupid, son. 
this has nothing to do with you. 
it's <unk> to stay like this. 
there's always a <unk> of <unk> between these <unk> 
but like so many <unk> in <unk> it became personal. 
it became personal when someone was killed. 
that's john henry <unk> 
he was killed over some business <unk> 
it's a personal matter now. 
john <unk> death was on his way to <unk> to find <unk> 
this road <unk> him to become a <unk> <unk> <unk> 
as the country continues to <unk> men like billy the kid were <unk> <unk> <unk> 
but a man in new york is about <unk> miles away trying to bring order to the west. 
the way men get what they want, and every day there's no one left to <unk> the <unk> no one in <unk> <unk> 
he was big for the <unk> century. 
he was very <unk> with this <unk> 
<unk> <unk> was one of thousands of <unk> headed west to be rich. 
<unk> <unk> west <unk> 
you always said we had to cross the next line. 
this border would be <unk> <unk> and anything that would bring adventure. 
<unk> life is so <unk> 
he did almost everything he could to get it. 
ray <unk> is doing everything in his power to <unk> the <unk> <unk> even <unk> 
to take the open <unk> to the <unk> <unk> the <unk> had to be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> 
so he <unk> the <unk> <unk> 
a view of the <unk> <unk> suddenly reached a hotel of 50 <unk> 
if you refuse to come to this <unk> young men will drink <unk> and <unk> like <unk> 
so you've got good liquor and lots of <unk> 
that's one of the reasons <unk> is <unk> 
<unk> saw that <unk> <unk> wasn't <unk> and that <unk> was <unk> 
she had a tough life. 
either we go back to <unk> or worse. 
but <unk> <unk> thought <unk> was more <unk> 
i thought <unk> was gonna be an important place, <unk> 
you've got the wrong guy. 
that's my <unk> 
this guy's a <unk> 
calm down. 
he <unk> 
calm down. 
the guy <unk> 
put the gun down.

i must admit, most of the <unk> are dying. 
but there's no way a <unk> could <unk> 
you knew that already, <unk>

who? 
barry came to <unk>

<unk> 
not like before. 
if there are other people in the room, we can't find
most people don't dance with <unk> <unk> <unk> in others. 
i always liked him. 
i was with him when the crowd <unk> 
no, here's what you need to do. 
send him to <unk> alone. 
first you take him out of the <unk> then you go with the people. 
i don't know if i can. 
<unk> 
without <unk> you are nothing. 
check this out. 
you can't live your life like this. 
i have no choice but to <unk> 
his name is <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> is <unk> 
this is what i will do to <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
even if i had an egg like <unk> i'd still be in the same <unk> <unk> 
even with a person taking <unk> you need <unk> 
<unk> is a much more <unk> <unk> 
getting into their <unk> 
i'm sorry. 
was it mine? 
i didn't mean to <unk> 
i didn't mean to. 
wouldn't you like to see <unk> continue to <unk> 
when you're dressed like her, you smell like her. 
wouldn't he want that? 
they've been using genetic <unk> all along. 
i can certainly prove it. 
never. 
you have <unk> too. 
i want some <unk> 
<unk> 
it'll be a real first conversation. 
i feel really good about him. 
but hurry up. 
i'm the one with the <unk> <unk> 
barry <unk> <unk> 
any <unk> 
forget it! 
<unk> your own <unk> 
<unk> closer to court, and my <unk> a little <unk> 
i have no idea. 
<unk> 
things are <unk> 
will you stop <unk> me? 
you think that's what i do? 
i didn't ignore you. 
i thought you weren't coming. 
you were right. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i haven't slept since i met this <unk> 
i remember because you lied to me. 
i can't sleep because i can't sleep with you. 
it's hard to imagine the happy <unk> around here. 
<unk> it's hard to be a girl. 
i don't understand why you do this every day. 
obviously, we're both a little bit <unk> 
so why don't we start over? 
you might be right. 
say <unk> 
<unk> 
how are you? 
no <unk> 
this is definitely <unk> <unk> right? 
something's <unk> 
yes, it is. 
no one, just you and me. 
he's a funny little man, isn't he? 
i don't mind. 
<unk> 
it's like being dr. <unk> 
don't start <unk> <unk> 
dna <unk> 
it's horrible. 
wayne <unk> could be <unk> with <unk> 
a <unk> mike <unk> 
<unk> 
<unk> 
but the truth is every time science is <unk> it <unk> to its <unk> 
you've already made <unk> <unk> your honor. 
<unk> <unk> 
this technology could save lives. 
risk <unk> 
of course. 
<unk> knows about your wife's <unk> and <unk> 
together they have what they have. 
this <unk> will allow them to <unk> their family <unk> 
we have to be open to a <unk> that allows a child to have a child. 
<unk> can't have who owns her <unk> can he? 
mr. <unk> is also <unk> that the <unk> who died in life have not been <unk> without <unk> 
i'm just saying that in case mr. paul says something wrong with <unk> <unk> 
but there's no reason not to. 
i'm not sure when i'll be back. 
now it's your turn. 
it may not be a legal <unk> 
but there's a moral <unk> 
that's what this is about. 
then why are you standing there? 
he loved his mother too. 
<unk> 
one day the <unk> will <unk> the great <unk> of <unk> 
<unk> was trying to sell <unk> 
barry <unk> told <unk> you were a parent to his brother. 
when technology <unk> the <unk> when it started to take over the <unk> would it be a <unk> 
a <unk> heart rate <unk> 
the idea of a baby being born is <unk> 
now you accept the truth and society 
we have reason to destroy <unk> <unk> life <unk> 
these can also be real. 
but you can't send a person to <unk> <unk> to <unk> medical school. 
<unk> 
i'm sorry. 
i appreciate your <unk> 
i don't want <unk> 
hi. 
hi. 
do you come here <unk> 
that's my <unk> 
it's terrible <unk> 
has it ever worked before? 
better.

<unk> <unk> 
it's not that. 
to tell you the truth, i didn't want to win this time. 
no, i want to be alone tonight. 
i married her. 
not at all. 
like you said, most people don't dance with <unk> <unk> 
you're not crazy. 
actually, it's a bit <unk> 
there's something <unk> in the real world. 
hey. 
maybe the three of us can. 
give it a chance. 
if he <unk> i'm still in. 
well, i'll do that. 
let's go. 
who knew <unk> <unk> would be the <unk> party in <unk> 
<unk> <unk> and <unk> 
let's just say, <unk> in the <unk> never <unk> 
<unk> <unk> called and said, 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
sam, i've been here 30 minutes, but i haven't even had a hand <unk> yet. 
your favorite table is ready. 
ladies love a good <unk> danny. 
call me. 
you think you can get any girl you want? 
kill him. 
you can't be alone, man. 
<unk> is here to <unk> the virgin <unk> 
girls who aren't technically <unk> are pure <unk> 
the card <unk> are <unk> two <unk> this month, and the last <unk> report says it's a big <unk> 
there's a card <unk> downstairs. 
<unk> thinks it might be a card <unk> 
maybe we should continue this conversation later, say, over a drink? 
<unk> it's been three weeks and you've been here a week. 
<unk> <unk> and <unk> 
listen, i'm sorry, but this is a hospital. 
<unk> paid for every <unk> 
okay, the gift <unk> is <unk> and waiting to go to <unk> 
<unk> brings in the <unk> and the remaining 1,000 are due tomorrow. 
however, for a reason, <unk> is a <unk> for future <unk> 
mary, don't worry. 
i'm sure everything will be okay. 
you're the most comfortable person i've ever seen. 
thanks for coming, <unk> 
this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> 
hundred thousand <unk> 
like i said, it's important to me. 
<unk> <unk> is <unk> 
you wanted to do a certain <unk> 
<unk> if you have a table and you have a <unk> you can <unk> right? 
suspect lady, red <unk> yellow <unk> on the west side. 
thank you. 
mr. <unk> i'm with you. 
always the <unk> question. 
we're not finished yet, and you started staying out all night. 
<unk> not <unk> 
honey, you can't stay here. 
we're done for the night, and so are you. 
okay. 
i said to <unk> <unk> <unk> must be like a <unk> chicken <unk> 
the <unk> have been preparing for the biggest and most <unk> wedding this city has seen in months. 
come on. 
even <unk> was always the boss. 
why do you look so <unk> 
when they learn to play <unk> the <unk> will still be <unk> and that's all they can do. 
let's go, guys. 
the man in the <unk> told us he said a dozen words to the <unk> <unk> 
<unk> can point to the <unk> and <unk> that the game is rich. 
the <unk> there <unk> all night <unk> <unk> 
and keep your eyes on <unk> <unk> 
one minute before you got in a game with <unk> you stand up and play like a <unk> 
<unk> 
even if you lose the cards it's not illegal. 
that's technically true. 
but <unk> has a different sense of justice. 
as it used to be, i could destroy a <unk> in the desert. 
i'll be honest with you, i'm an old <unk> 
please. 
now that we have the <unk> we need the black <unk> 
if you don't let <unk> in, <unk> <unk> you. 
you hear that? 
hey, jack! 
the guy <unk> us with his <unk> 
as long as you don't have a machine in your hand, you know it's not illegal and he didn't have it. 
at least i had some fun with him. 
it's not the end of the story. 
it's not the end of anything. 
i'm mike from last night at <unk> 
the man with no <unk> 
actually, there are other <unk> you are not. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
it's <unk> but i have to go. 
<unk> and <unk> right? 
finally, you said something <unk> 
i think you must have a problem because you usually do. 
then what? 
maybe you're a little upset because you're so beautiful. 
<unk> 
you know what we're gonna do? 
what? 
we're gonna sit down and try to figure out why we don't have a drink.
<unk> 
almost there. 
you think i'm good? 
i don't care if you're okay. 
you <unk> 
please. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> said he didn't come back this morning, but there's no record of him going there. 
our 400 friends will be taking over the next <unk> of <unk> <unk> 
<unk> you want to say that <unk> was <unk> and that las vegas was in <unk> for nothing? 
if you want to <unk> you'll have to do the same. 
that dress is a <unk> <unk> 
a dozen french <unk> <unk> el <unk> 
there's no other one. 
that dress reminds me of <unk> you know? 
it's a big problem, sam? 
wait. 
hey, danny, you asked me to make big <unk> <unk> 
<unk> already <unk> <unk> and <unk> for <unk> 
if the <unk> aren't like the wedding <unk> and they refuse to <unk> 
you think someone stole the <unk> 
what's the price of that thing? 
why not <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
mike. 
hey. 
let me know how it goes.

if we don't get a team, we'll have somebody else in a few hours. 
we might have to give them the keys to the <unk> <unk> 
you'd better leave now, you son of a bitch! 
you talking to <unk> 
you better get your hands off me, because the president gives me more than a <unk> <unk> 
that's good. 
did i kill <unk> 
i just want to know what happened. 
i make <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> 
you have a camera in your <unk>

i'm sorry. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
why don't you ask him about <unk> 
have you heard from <unk> 
yes, <unk> 
who's <unk> 
not me, because i know it's illegal here, but the others are <unk> 
do you know where they are? 
danny <unk> <unk> surveillance and <unk> 
how do you know nick <unk> 
the cops are after <unk> 
okay, wait, wait. 
fine, fine. 
that's enough. 
okay, i know her. 
he's been here a couple of times with his friends. 
are these his friends? 
you know these things? 
yeah, i guess so. 
nick is a good kid. 
part of me wanted to <unk> <unk> 
i guess he thought i wasn't <unk> 
<unk> always <unk> 
look, i got up for five minutes of work, and i didn't have to take my clothes off. 
why are you so <unk> 
because <unk> and his friends were on some kind of card <unk> 
i thought they were just some rich kids. 
somebody's behind this, and i need to find out who. 
do you have any idea who might be <unk> all this? 
i once met a big one of them. 
yes, we called him <unk> 
have you seen <unk> <unk> face? 
<unk> <unk> 
someone's paying him off. 
can you <unk> the <unk> 
no, but in other words, <unk> 
you mean, <unk> <unk> <unk> 
we need to talk. 
but you already know that, don't you? 
i know you paid to get rid of <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> why? 
this is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
listen. 
it's a little strange if you want to leave. 
that's the point. 
i don't know if i want to leave. 
i love her, but i don't. 
i mean, it's my fault for <unk> <unk> 
people say this is a <unk> story. 
i'm not <unk> 
just a <unk> new <unk> <unk> 
i didn't get much, but i thought my <unk> cost ten times the <unk> 
that's not true. 
yeah. 
<unk> and i are very close. 
i mean, what harm could it do? 
how old do you think these kids are? 
<unk> <unk> no <unk> 
danny, you can ask for it. 
we'll see. 
they all have <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
then they must have <unk> <unk> and <unk> kids. 
and then i thought, "how could i <unk> them? 
as soon as i figured out how the second team got here, i started with local <unk>
because you're a great guy and i have a thing for the less attractive ones. 
maybe change is <unk> 
listen, mike, before this goes any <unk> there's something i should tell you. 
i'm here to arrest <unk> <unk> 
<unk> 
i did my <unk> <unk> with the men, so i wanted to start over clean and i <unk> until i did. 
i mean, just because i gave it to <unk> doesn't make it any less <unk> 
the <unk> <unk> nice. 
good. 
<unk> 
do you want to go to school again? 
i want you to go back and do a <unk> <unk> and go down to the rain <unk> and see if you

what do you want? 
where's <unk> 
i don't know what you're talking about.

i don't think the <unk> around here like that. 
call <unk> right now and get your ass out of here. 
please, don't tell my family. 
hey. 
hey. 
have you heard of the virgin <unk> again? 
so you do this all the time? 
i'm sorry, but all that i wanted was to get any girl and get <unk> crap. 
yeah, <unk> is so sweet and <unk> 
thanks for meeting you. 
hey, where are you going? 
hey, mike. 
i won't be needing you. 
hey. 
i've been such a fool.

this is your life story. 
you never wanted someone to be emotionally <unk> on you, wondering how you are, where you are, wake up in the morning, waiting for you to get home at night.

i think we should be together. 
you can't keep this relationship from <unk> 
why did you let me go first? 
you first.

you can eat with me. 
we'll take care of <unk> 
honey, i'm not the right woman for you. 
you're so <unk> you're a great guy to have fun.

what the hell was that? 
i think my head felt <unk> 
i can't be <unk> <unk> 
i think so. 
you know what the worst part is? 
i don't care about anyone but myself. 
it's really impossible for me to meet other people. 
i feel the need to connect with the <unk> but i have no idea how to do it. 
i'm in trouble, man.

often people ask me why i love children so much. 
maybe he never had one of his own. 
i believe that the happiness of <unk> is the <unk> of the people we want to live in, and the <unk> of those
and because they're <unk> they are the most important <unk> 
they do things for you, they do it with <unk> 
or maybe i just started to believe that you had a <unk> life to fight for yourself. 
i wasn't going to, but i think i should write a little song on my private <unk> 
so nice of you to drop off the <unk> part.

there's got to be somewhere. 
man, come on. 
here? 
yeah. 
it's in the back. 
i just <unk> 
it's not a secure <unk> 
then you say <unk> 
backup comes in 20 minutes. 
sounds about right. 
we got to get the bad guys to the <unk> 
we were on our way to <unk> 
good idea, <unk> 
<unk> 
<unk> 
if i'm right, this has to be in a real car!

<unk> when did you get those <unk> 
you left and i went back to <unk>

anyway, i'm walking down here. 
no sign of <unk> 
what about <unk> 
no sign of him either. 
looks like he took her with him. 
there's no <unk> 
and wayne <unk> will testify against <unk> 
and as i'm sure you said, 
<unk> to hell with <unk> 
well, that'll do. 
yeah, but you know what's <unk> 
that wasn't part of the plan. 
it just happened. 
you came all this way for me? 
no. 
i came all this way to see wayne <unk> <unk> 
i'm so sorry, jack. 
well, i sold a sports car and set fire to the <unk> 
<unk> have you thought about this? 
south <unk> man <unk> 
did you know he lived there in <unk> 
this is <unk> 
dan is pure <unk> okay? 
it's hard to take it as <unk> 
<unk> i can't. 
what do you mean? 
i never thought i'd see you again. 
cover me. 
i'll call <unk> and ask for backup. 
yes, <unk> 
i'm <unk> <unk> 
it won't be long, okay? 
code three, how many people did you <unk> 
hey, <unk> 
sorry to keep you waiting. 
how much is this door <unk> 
five dollars. 
that's a <unk> 
that's el <unk> 
i'll give you three. 
okay. 
here. 
three dollars. 
how much for one of them <unk> 
50 <unk> <unk> 
why would i do that? 
<unk> 
i'm not saying <unk> 
what made you change your <unk> 
well, i thought it would be <unk> <unk> 
yeah. 
exactly. 
you're wasting your time. 
i brought you the best stuff. 
this is the best heroin that money can buy. 
that's <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
here. 
<unk> <unk> huh? 
well, listen. 
wait. 
wayne young got married within 48 hours, 
all <unk> 
actually, <unk> 
all i had to do was ask. 
like i said, being a cop is a <unk> 
but most of it is <unk> <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> around here are constantly <unk> with rare and difficult <unk> 
200 tons of <unk> 30 <unk> and the biggest <unk> that ever lived. 
despite their <unk> blue <unk> are the most <unk> and <unk> of all <unk> 
over <unk> miles a day. 
it takes a lot of effort to <unk> your giant mouth, so only when you see a rich and <unk> <unk> make you <unk> 
here in <unk> <unk> are often very <unk> 
when it's all over, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> <unk> must be very <unk> because other <unk> have <unk> heavy <unk> that <unk> water <unk> 
the little <unk> <unk> the only <unk> between the dead <unk> and the <unk> 
with the extra power of the <unk> the flying <unk> can <unk> more than once. 
a good <unk> can fly hundreds of <unk> 
all open ocean <unk> are designed to look for food. 
so <unk> <unk> 
this <unk> fish must sleep on the <unk> of <unk> 
these <unk> <unk> which are not <unk> will see more <unk> than <unk> 
at last weeks first opportunity. 
only <unk> can make a move when he's a few miles away. 
perfect <unk> <unk> <unk> 
the open <unk> are so powerful that some <unk> can only find enough <unk> to <unk> themselves. 
<unk> live in highly advanced social <unk> 
working together, we can <unk> a large <unk> of the ocean. 
little <unk> sometimes come together, <unk> <unk> super <unk> 
we use <unk> to find the <unk> 
but these little <unk> <unk> spend most of their time in the middle of the ocean. 
only when they come up to the surface for <unk> they're <unk> 
a great many <unk> time <unk> the <unk> another <unk> 
<unk> <unk> has <unk> the <unk> to keep them from <unk> safe <unk> again. 
the lower <unk> is more <unk> than <unk> so the <unk> will do everything in its power to protect precious <unk> 
<unk> is merely a <unk> of <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> have a unique <unk> <unk> <unk> in order to catch <unk> <unk> 
these deep water <unk> are long <unk> for <unk> <unk> 
the open <unk> may be a wide blue <unk> but like all <unk> there are <unk> 
the sea <unk> <unk> deep ocean <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the surface. 
success here depends on sensitive <unk> 
<unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
the lion <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> so it is difficult to <unk> how close she is to the <unk> 
the <unk> he used to hide his slow and <unk> <unk> <unk> him <unk> 
the <unk> <unk> that <unk> so many <unk> also <unk> these <unk> 
they travel hundreds of miles between sea <unk> as the <unk> point of <unk> <unk> 
both <unk> have <unk> <unk> and <unk> travel among other <unk> <unk> 
no one knows for sure why, but <unk> is coming to look for food. 
if these little <unk> stay close to <unk> the dog <unk> them. 
as long as the silver <unk> stay close to the ocean <unk> the <unk> will <unk> 
there's never an easy meal in the open <unk> 
here, the water <unk> to the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> 
black <unk> <unk> are the same size as <unk> <unk> but three times as <unk> so they need a totally different flight <unk> 
<unk> have the longest wing <unk> and that <unk> the <unk> of the southern polar <unk> 
first of all, the charges against <unk> are <unk> to his <unk> <unk> 
then we turn around and <unk> <unk> <unk> 
he was in the sea most times when he was looking for a <unk> he had no time to
because the <unk> here is so <unk> it <unk> the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> 
he <unk> like a <unk> so he <unk> on the <unk> of the southern polar bear to be <unk> by <unk> 
like all <unk> the <unk> have to <unk> on <unk> but the southern <unk> are so few <unk> that they are <unk> <unk> 
nearly half a million <unk> come here each year to <unk> 
in a few days at the <unk> we expect <unk> to return to our <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> time to <unk> 
<unk> are so <unk> that they can only see that their <unk> are strong enough. 
<unk> <unk> may seem like the ocean <unk> but under the <unk> there's always powerful <unk> moving <unk> 
this <unk> is more <unk> than any other <unk> that <unk> the <unk> 
the entire <unk> of the <unk> <unk> will lead to this <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> and animals brought together to eat fresh <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> continue to <unk> a few <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> that carry these <unk> are also <unk> for the <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
these <unk> <unk> are <unk> between the ocean <unk> where <unk> <unk> 
each <unk> has an extraordinary sense of smell <unk> left by <unk> 
big fish <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
a <unk> <unk> could be <unk> 
they <unk> themselves to <unk> 
when the attack comes, the <unk> move as one. 
each fish <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and the whole <unk> moves in <unk> 
even when more sea <unk> come, the <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> 
the <unk> would need to <unk> these <unk> to a smaller <unk> <unk> 
but with so few <unk> the <unk> still <unk> 
all the sea <unk> can do is keep the <unk> <unk> and save others to join them. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> so that the <unk> can <unk> out of deep <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> in less than an hour. 
<unk> once again his own <unk> will disappear within <unk> 
this blue <unk> is still <unk> for <unk> <unk> 
being so <unk> he has to find an average of four tons of food a day. 
<unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> 
this blue <unk> has finally found what he's been looking for. 
a <unk> that <unk> the big mouth. 
<unk> <unk> hundreds of <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> its <unk> to target the <unk> part of the <unk> 
he lives in a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> uses its tongue to <unk> out the water and <unk> its <unk> <unk> 
but it takes time to <unk> so much water. 
blue <unk> may not be as <unk> as other <unk> but they don't need to be. 
no other <unk> is more <unk> to <unk> <unk> than to <unk> <unk> 
blue <unk> are the greatest <unk> of all the <unk> in the world. 
the open <unk> caused a lot of trouble to <unk> 
<unk> this is a <unk> mission. 
<unk> worked with john <unk> the world's most important blue <unk> <unk> 
john gets vital information from these <unk> <unk> 
well, part of this <unk> and part of the reason that, uh, we're working with <unk> is that it gives us a unique chance to <unk> scientific information. 
so we are doing this under our research on how to <unk> what to do and how to use it. 
your team depends on a good <unk> <unk> 
very <unk> and the <unk> are <unk> <unk> 
<unk> 
the first year was <unk> by poor <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
second year is better than <unk> 
blue <unk> only <unk> to the surface in 15 minutes. 
he has to try and pull the boat out of the <unk> but not in front of it.
then <unk> gets in the water and <unk> gets close enough to get a <unk> 
this year the water is <unk> clean and yet it takes time to <unk> the <unk> 
after weeks of <unk> he finally brings all the <unk> together and gives <unk> a chance of life. 
the <unk> was <unk> it took a long time. 
i mean, he was so <unk> like a <unk> train. 
the blue <unk> <unk> video is very <unk> so it is <unk> to <unk> a <unk> <unk> 
this series is all about <unk> and so nice though it is to have that shot to make a <unk> we've got to get shots of blue <unk> eating <unk> 
and we have to wait for <unk> to come to the surface. 
once a month, maybe twice. 
<unk> comes across a <unk> <unk> but it's very <unk> 
<unk> look at this <unk> 
let's go take a look. 
look at this <unk> 
i'm still not fully <unk> by what you just said. 
david <unk> turned him into a camera. 
he took a <unk> he went up and took a big <unk> 
the reason i called them blue <unk> is because i found them under water, <unk> them in the <unk> of the <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the ocean
i was up at the <unk> trying to get another <unk> and his mouth open then, with his mouth open, one more time. 
it was probably less than ten minutes, but <unk> <unk> was the most amazing thing i've ever seen. 
to share the water and to look eye to eye with a blue <unk> is something i will never forget. 
and <unk> 
yeah, that's a unique way of looking at things that will never change. 
with this close <unk> the team have <unk> blue <unk> as never before and at last have started to reveal the secret life of the <unk> greatest <unk> 
i like her. 
no, i don't. 
every friend in <unk> <unk> likes him. 
<unk> right? 
when <unk> went away as an exchange student she <unk> a list of <unk> and <unk> and it helped her <unk> 
yes, <unk> <unk> 
<unk> plus <unk> of <unk> <unk> to the whole school. 
look, i'm coming to stay with you for a while. 
no, you're in trouble. 
<unk> 
okay. 
double <unk> <unk> 
and <unk> <unk> 
everyone thinks <unk> is a dangerous place. 
<unk> 
i know every rabbit <unk> broken <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
and nice <unk> 
it doesn't matter where i am, <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
and <unk> 
everyone will <unk> 
<unk> join us. 
but <unk> is a completely different story. 
if you think you can get away with it, think again. 
i didn't realize you were actually a <unk> <unk> 
wherever they go, they set a new trap. 
<unk> <unk> like christmas. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> everything, <unk> 
could it be any <unk> 
yes, according to the <unk> 
at least i'm not the first minus the <unk> 
i guess i should be grateful for that. 
i'm really sorry, <unk> 
i didn't mean to include you in your <unk> 
believe me, i'm too old to be like this. 
here's a good <unk> 
my brother will break your heart, and when he does, i won't be there to fix the pieces. 
i promise i'll stay away from her. 
do you think <unk> <unk> the third <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> me. 
yes, a question for you. 
who can tell me the true meaning of <unk> de <unk> 
<unk> de <unk> 
<unk> means dancing. 
but what does <unk> <unk> mean, <unk> <unk> 
<unk> de <unk> 
two <unk> one <unk> 
a man and a woman dance in the same <unk> 
<unk> <unk> is about this. 
i never danced with a man before. 
that's right. 
<unk> girls dance with girls. 
there were no guys. 
<unk> boys are just <unk> creatures that <unk> their <unk> 
<unk> de <unk> has three important rules. 
trust. 
throw it to someone. 
<unk>

i'll be right back. 
instead, you'll be doing an exercise for me. 
remember, as in other <unk> this is <unk> <unk> 
this is a <unk> 
i'll be <unk> a <unk> dog. 
at least you don't have to spend 24 hours with <unk> like me. 
i prefer to open my eyes with a blind <unk> 
i know 20 questions in 24 hours.

<unk> any questions? 
"but you must answer <unk> 
like you want to know something about <unk> 
so you're not alone.

that's right. 
bad <unk> 
it's crime and <unk> 
less thinking and more doing before we both die of <unk> 
<unk> would you please write a song or something? 
hurry up. 
i still don't understand why you can't tell everyone about that <unk> 
it was just like a <unk> <unk> all the time. 
it just made you look bad. 
okay, don't say anything. 
<unk> you <unk> 
hey, where's <unk> 
i don't know. 
<unk> 
<unk> 
hey, baby. 
there's a <unk> <unk> room. 
hey!

i can't stand being around here. 
anyway, what are you still doing here? 
if you must know, i was waiting for <unk> 
how dare you see me in a <unk> 
you don't know anything about me. 
i don't think i want to know. 
i've never met anyone so <unk> 
didn't your mother teach you <unk> 
he's dead. 
look, if you're wondering, all you have to do is ask. 
who says i'm <unk> 
just checking the <unk> 
what do you know? 
i'll explain everything. 
this <unk> thing must be working. 
yeah? 
can you see that? 
<unk> 
i can't imagine what it's like to lose your mother.

was she <unk> 
yeah, he was young. 
is that why you wanted to get into <unk> 
<unk> 
<unk> 
i don't believe you. 
remember how you <unk> 
right. 
<unk> lives in <unk> 
very good. 
and say i got in trouble. 
i don't know, probably. 
you said you were close. 
so you don't think he <unk> do you? 
<unk> helping <unk> 
maybe that'll help you find him. 
the room only <unk> another <unk> so he doesn't know it's me. 
you know everything now. 
true or wrong? 
i didn't mean it wrong, but... 
see, you don't see anything. 
<unk> and i are very close. 
i have one question left. 
<unk> question. 
shoot. 
why don't you tell everyone in the wrong dressing room? 
you knew it was an accident. 
why do you care about this <unk> 
i believe you, you're still lying about this. 
i know you did. 
you know, i wasn't the only guy there. 
have you thought about that? 
<unk> what were you thinking? 
don't you think so? 
do you think he lived here or <unk> 
it says two and four hours. 
you want to know why i fought against <unk> 
because <unk> is so <unk> 
i need to talk to you. 
like you don't know. 
you've been after me this whole time, haven't you? 
excuse me? 
<unk> <unk> <unk> you told everyone i was in the wrong dressing room.

come on, admit it's a funny story. 
and leave me alone, <unk> 
<unk> right? 
but you weren't even with us. 
<unk> and <unk> are not responding to any <unk> 
i didn't realize i needed an answer. 
of course you did. 
because of you, the whole school is counting on me. 
why would it be because of me? 
look, if you want to hear the truth, it's because of that list. 
i mean, we've only met you three or four times, right? 
and you go to all the school and you tell everyone you feel. 
i don't even know you. 
<unk> 
<unk> 
i'll marry you. 
yes, <unk> 
i thought you were sick of girls coming to you after the <unk> 
because i hate seeing my friends sad. 
<unk> my mom and dad took me against all the <unk> 
we have to make a difference here. 
remind me that <unk> <unk> is not a waste of time. 
nice work, guys. 
<unk> it or not, for the next <unk> years we will be <unk> <unk> 
so we have a very long road ahead.

look, it's not cancer. 
a heart attack. 
will she be okay? 
yes, <unk> 
but we gotta work as hard as we used to. 
i'm gonna have to ask <unk> and i need you to help him with this. 
i always tell her she works too hard. 
johnny, he works very hard. 
you need to learn a few things you can do at home. 
you see, my mother told you that no one else could ever love you. 
his <unk> is <unk> <unk>

why are you here, <unk> 
i don't know. 
your mother and i were very happy here, but... 
i don't care about things anymore. 
i don't know why. 
i think we should just forget about the <unk> and start <unk> them. 
that's a good idea. 
john, you can't do this! 
i'll make a list of things we enjoy myself. 
yes, sir. 
<unk> 
what? 
i think you made a mistake. 
hey, i got <unk>

it's a <unk> 
we can get <unk> and regular <unk> 
i was in new york, and i gave him a <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
they're building a system for us. 
you'll see. 
i don't know these guys, dad.

your father was a foreign <unk> 
only the red <unk> <unk> 
that's red wine <unk> 
mom, that look. 
i don't want him to have any <unk> while i'm here. 
no one who eats <unk> <unk> is <unk> 
relax, <unk> 
don't believe anything. 
i'm just here with <unk> and don't worry about me. 
you sure you want to come, dad? 
it's gonna be a long meeting. 
no, i will. 
it'll do me good. 
i could buy you lunch here, you could watch a movie. 
<unk> <unk> 
i'll be fine. 
okay. 
i want to see john <unk> <unk> <unk> please. 
he's expecting you. 
dad, do you think you can be comfortable around here?

this is my father, jake <unk> 
dad, this is <unk> <unk> 
nice to meet you, mr. <unk> 
me too. 
will we be here in an hour? 
like i said. 
okay, well, take care, dad. 
wait a minute, wait a minute. 
we'll leave your father here. 
mr. <unk> why don't you come and work with us? 
i can handle this. 
<unk> we've given you all our <unk> and now our <unk> are <unk> less than <unk> 
how can you be so sure? 
<unk> never run a business like this before. 
and if you don't, we'll be <unk> <unk> and we'll never be able to do business with you again. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
it will pay for every minute it's open but the property it's on is worth at least 50 million. 
how can you be so sure of 50 million <unk> 
i can sell it for 40 million dollars. 
do you have any <unk> 
can i call you <unk> now? 
<unk> real value is <unk> million and we don't have a problem with every <unk> around it. 
we've <unk> all the general <unk> but we have a plan that will <unk> the <unk> <unk> within a few months. 
just selling it isn't enough? 
that way we can <unk> the <unk> 
if this goes well, we won't have to. 
i don't think i can take it. 
you can't do this! 
the other thing is that food <unk> is a good <unk> 
now, <unk> cash seems <unk> but not <unk> 
all in all, we don't have a problem with <unk> <unk> 
yeah, that looks good. 
johnny, what's going on in there? 
well, we're a <unk> <unk> <unk> dad. 
i didn't know you had information about something like this. 
actually, i don't know. 
the guy who came to us for money has no idea. 
we're just gonna shut down the company and then drop the <unk> 
is that your <unk> 
are you <unk> <unk> and then <unk> 
it's a little <unk> dad. 
we take this <unk> to <unk> 
the company gets really fucked up later. 
this is the third <unk> board coming in, and they're <unk> <unk> 
but i have a little <unk> <unk> and that's the point. 
<unk> is built on a <unk> <unk> 
so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and then <unk> <unk> 
have you ever tried these <unk> <unk> 
there's no money in that, dad. 
world <unk> johnny. 
how the world <unk> <unk> 
remember when you started working with me in a little <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i pay <unk> a day and i get <unk> for it. 
<unk> said you wanted to work there with me. 
but now you get to buy the job that you do, and then you kill him. 
did you hear anything about those <unk> <unk> 
rick <unk> 
tommy <unk> 
they all went to <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
there was no one there to say goodbye. 
next morning, no one else did what i did. 
the world belongs to two <unk> 
<unk> and <unk> 
i don't know, dad, <unk> 
it's all right, johnny. 
there's nothing wrong here. 
i'm a <unk> that's all. 
but you, you're <unk> 
you chose to be <unk> 
i refuse to take responsibility. 
you're a <unk> 
mom? 
what do you think? 
okay, dad. 
"if you see a <unk> <unk> you can see the <unk> 
why are you doing this? 
i've already written the written <unk> 
i know, but we have to be very careful. 
the <unk> here are <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i want to make you believe that. 
very good. 
thank you. 
we've come this far. 
i don't want to see anything wrong now. 
they want you to put it over there. 
<unk> 
<unk> <unk> not so fast. 
okay, stop. 
there she is. 
jake <unk> 
actually, he's jake <unk> 
i'm his wife, <unk> 
i guess you didn't need to know that, but you heard it. 
we can't stay here during the <unk> sir. 
oh, i'm sorry. 
oh, you can sleep in the car. 
what are you talking about? 
that's my dad. 
those are the rules. 
i won't take the test unless you stay in the car.
either you leave now, or your father is a failure. 
everything okay? 
it'll be all right. 
park <unk> was seen leaving the <unk>

i have some friends there. 
dad, you say that every time. 
and i haven't slept in two years.

<unk> <unk> and <unk> 
it's embarrassing if your mother <unk> more than you do, but we work. 
<unk> <unk> 
how are you? 
sometimes <unk> sometimes <unk> 
if i let you go, you'll lose more than <unk> 
if we can find a piece of <unk> <unk> 
he looks great. 
what's going on? 
well, we've been spending a lot of time together. 
good time, huh? 
they say it's good for <unk> and the kids. 
maybe you and i should spend more time together. 
this place looks great, <unk> 
too <unk> 
good <unk> 
i can't name this after you, bill. 
<unk> <unk> 
you want some <unk> honey? 
i want to make <unk> 
<unk> 
a lot has happened in the last two weeks. 
we got through some <unk> we had a <unk> 
you made it all as a team. 
it's thanksgiving time. 
<unk> <unk> 
it's my usual <unk> speech. 
actually, i just wanted to say how happy i am to see <unk> together like this. 
<unk> <unk> 
it's over. 
very good. 
i'll have a toast. 
hmm. 
wow, dad. 
dear <unk> 
<unk> 
any luck today, <unk> 
before you came home, mother, i had a glass of <unk> <unk> <unk> 
dear <unk> 
back to where you were when <unk> <unk> was born. 
it's so good to be home. 
listen, listen. 
nice <unk> dad. 
it's nice to have everybody here. 
i can't remember the last time we had john and <unk> together. 
billy looks good. 
i like that dress. 
should i be <unk> too? 
there's a <unk> that goes with that if you want. 
oh, leave her alone, mom. 
it looks great. 
i'll bet the girls are all over it. 
don't worry about me. 
it's nothing to be ashamed of. 
<unk> <unk> 
is that true? 
yes, our <unk> is complicated too. 
good thing it wasn't like this when we were kids. 
if it was, i wouldn't have <unk> school. 
as if you were a student to me. 
<unk> was a great <unk> mom. 
he graduated high school. 
not even the book is <unk> <unk> <unk> 
yeah, but all my good friends and all my books at the same time have <unk> <unk> 
but john was a good <unk> 
thanks, <unk> 
every friday night i walk out of the <unk> 
four books. 
if we don't get them back to <unk> we'll have four new books. 
you did more than that. 
so how does it work? 
were the girls on the other floor? 
somebody stop that man! 
i'm just happy. 
while you're here, <unk> and <unk> will handle things for you. 
sure, you get so used to hearing it, but you don't believe it's real. 
<unk> believe me. 
<unk> still <unk> 
i'm sorry. 
so when do we have to go to school? 
i'm not going to school. 
i'm thinking of going away for a while. 
what's <unk> <unk> 
all the <unk> started coming here. 
did you know that? 
there's a couple of kids from school. 
we have very similar <unk> 
it's, uh, it's good. 
yeah, i do, but believe it or not, you may want to work one day, bill. 
your mexican <unk> is nothing to you. 
if you want to be a <unk> <unk> you need a school <unk> 
i'd say i went to <unk> 
i got the <unk> 
i did the right thing. 
two <unk> 
somebody call the <unk> 
i'm going to be back to new york soon and i want to put this on its
what does your mother think? 
she thinks i made my own decision. 
i'm not sure how i feel about this. 
we need to talk more about this. 
i don't understand why. 
i've never talked about it until now, and i know what i want. 
johnny, something's wrong. 
can you come here and take a look? 
that's enough, mr. <unk> 
you can come if you like. 
is he okay? 
yes, fine. 
<unk> starts with a <unk> 
not yet. 
any idea what the problem is? 
it could be one of a few things. 
i suspect <unk> is <unk> <unk> 
the problem is, whether they're good or not. 
will this show when you do the <unk> 
not exactly. 
that's not a good sign. 
so it's serious? 
i think we should send him to a general <unk> 
if it were serious, dad, you wouldn't be <unk> 
i can open you right now and <unk> under the <unk> 
if it's just a <unk> it's really <unk> 
i don't think i should tell my mom that. 
if there's nothing there, why <unk> 
whatever you say, johnny. 
you're the boss. 
he told you, didn't he? 
of course he did. 
then you know there's nothing serious. 
if it wasn't serious, you'd have told me yourself. 
look, mom, you're going to have to stay away from a potential <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
that's why i didn't tell you. 
he says it's just a <unk> 
that's right. 
a simple operation <unk> 
yes, it is. 
mom, if anything went wrong, i'd tell you. 
sure. 
okay. 
are you sitting here like this, john, and you're just gonna stand there and be <unk>

we were never married.

come on. 
i love you, johnny. 
i love you, too, dad. 
well, mr. <unk> i'm afraid it's <unk>

yeah. 
the good thing is we can destroy him with <unk> 
listen, dr. <unk> 
how dare you say <unk> cancer is <unk> 
you're too <unk> and this <unk> too <unk> 
say something more <unk> 
calm down, mr. <unk> 
you'd be surprised what others can do. 
the kids wouldn't even believe it. 
i don't underestimate him, doctor. 
i just want to tell her myself, that's all. 
that's <unk> right? 
mom, i told you. 
it's just a <unk> and we can't stop it. 
i want to see him. 
mom! 
mom, i can't see him right now. 
will you listen to me? 
it's a <unk> <unk> 
if all goes well, let me see him. 
<unk> come on, mom! 
john only wants you to win. 
you know. 
i loved her, mom. 
he's my husband and i'm gonna see him. 
now you can either take me there or i <unk> but i'm going anyway. 
what's in there? 
<unk> go find dr. <unk> 
come on! 
get out of here. 
what happened to him? 
jake, it's me! 
why didn't you call me? 
<unk> 
mr. <unk> i'm dr. <unk> 
do you know who i am? 
i'm fine. 
i'm fine now, thanks. 
give him 25 <unk> <unk> and check his <unk> every two hours. 
yes, doctor. 
this is exactly the same with the other <unk> 
it's often <unk> after every simple <unk> 
is that it? 
you know what happened in there? 
i know this is a <unk> experience. 
when he got here, he <unk> 
why are you crying now? 
<unk> <unk> 
come and go. 
a stress situation like this can suddenly be <unk> 
i'm sure it's a nice <unk> and <unk> condition is <unk> 
what do we do in the <unk> 
nothing. 
what do you mean, <unk> 
we'll wait for <unk> to <unk> 
did you tell dad you had <unk> 
he has the right to know. 
you don't know exactly what it is you want from me, mr. <unk> 
dr. <unk> 
i don't trust <unk> 
you're the hospital <unk> and what i want to say is that she doesn't know us. 
dr. <unk> is a fine young woman. 
it seems to me he's been <unk> and <unk> about your father. 
i told him i would never give him cancer because he is so afraid of that <unk> 
but he did what he did, just as soon as i hit him. 
yes, it's difficult for every doctor to say. 
he was a family man who was willing to <unk> your father's <unk> rights. 
i'm sure you had no choice. 
i had a <unk> 
you broke my promise. 
i know my father. 
why do you keep your arms <unk> 
to hurt yourself. 
<unk> <unk> 
well, then, i'm his <unk> and i don't think he needs any of this. 
give us a call when you're ready, and we'll put him back in. 
i can't believe it. 
hey, dad, how's it going? 
do you always think that? 
look, hey, look, look, i brought <unk> 
and <unk> here. 
hey, dad. 
how are you feeling, dad? 
can you hear me? 
hey, <unk> it's billy. 
how's it going? 
god, john, i can't stand to see him looking like this. 
i think that's enough. 
i gave him a <unk> 
it <unk> him. 
how long has he been like this? 
all the time we've been here. 
<unk> 
jesus, doc. 
i'm glad you're not a detective. 
yeah, he seemed <unk> 
what the hell is going on here? 
i meant more than <unk> mr. <unk> 
mr. <unk> 
you keep telling me he's <unk> <unk> doctor. 
this isn't <unk> <unk> <unk> right, but the <unk> will bring him back. 
<unk> 
he's <unk> 
the man <unk> 
he didn't kill any of his family, and you gave him only one <unk> 
why don't you call him <unk> 
maybe you should ask <unk> 
we decided to <unk> your father tomorrow. 
you can pick him up after <unk> 
what do you mean, <unk> 
you want to tell me that my father is <unk> 
well, of course not, but <unk> speaking there's nothing we can do to him. 
if you don't help me get out of the way, you don't go back to <unk> for nothing.
how could i <unk> 
i never helped <unk> 
what exactly do you mean? 
whatever you say. 
so it's not even the dead <unk> 
what kind of conversation is that? 
listen to this. 
just relax. 
you want my father out of here? 
look what i'm going to do. 
i'll do better than you know. 
you're <unk> to him. 
john, what are you doing? 
mr. <unk> <unk> him. 
that's not necessary. 
i say we take her home. 
mr. <unk> this <unk> is <unk> 
what do we do now? 
i don't know. 
we don't have much choice, but <unk> 
no, i don't want to do that. 
i don't want to take him to a <unk> 
me too, john, but we have to do something. 
wait a second, john. 
you can't help him now. 
i think i can do that. 
i can do better than <unk> <unk> 
i'll stay and help. 
no. 
why not? 
i'll take care of him. 
he's my father. 
well, he's my <unk> too. 
and i'm your mother. 
i don't want you here right now, billy. 
you can't do this! 
dad, i'm not a kid. 
look, i think you should go. 
go back to school, go back to mexico. 
you get out of here. 
<unk> 
yeah, i got it. 
i want to talk to her. 
i don't think that's a good idea now, mom, really. 
<unk> right, mom. 
here's your <unk> 
you don't like that, do you, <unk> 
i meant <unk> mom. 
it's just a <unk> 
he's <unk> 
john married her. 
let's go, dad. 
isn't that the boy <unk> <unk> 
<unk> reminds me of bob <unk> 
you know, a real <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
good. 
here we go. 
<unk> 
i'm gonna need some <unk> on the <unk> 
okay. 
what you need is a little <unk> 
well, i think you're right. 
wait till you taste this. 
come on, dad. 
okay. 
hmm, okay. 
here. 
try this. 
come on, dad, take a <unk> 
come on, there you go. 
let's try <unk> 
dad, don't put things in the window. 
home <unk> 
you don't like it there, do you? 
neither did i. 
good luck, huh? 
come on, dad. 
that's better. 
okay, dad. 
stay that way for a minute and i'll kill you. 
i'll take these to <unk> 
why are you here, <unk> 
why are you here, <unk> 
what? 
you know, if you're worried about <unk> 
where's the <unk> 
that's your <unk> dad. 
what are you talking about? 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i'm worried about her. 
well, don't worry, dad. 
<unk> i'm sure he's okay. 
you think so? 
yeah. 
give me a hand with the <unk> <unk> 
it needs to be done now. 
look. 
what we need now is a good night's sleep. 
you always say you have a problem, <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
i mean, there's <unk> now, dad. 
let's sit on it. 
dad? 
dad? 
dad? 
dad, where are you? 
dad? 
dad? 
dad? 
dad? 
what do you think you're doing here? 
oh, dad, here, let me help you. 
come on, dad, come on. 
no. 
dad, i'm <unk> the bed. 
come on. 
come on, dad, get out. 
dad, come on. 
i've got you. 
<unk> 
come on. 
<unk> 
i got you, i got you. 
i've got you. 
mr. <unk> 
i understand you brought <unk> back to the hospital. 
yeah. 
i figured it would be difficult for him to stay home. 
that's not the place for him right now. 
if you stay at home, you can stay here, right? 
maybe we should talk to a lawyer in <unk> 
i know what kids say when they say <unk> 
you know what that means. 
i know what happened to <unk> 
mr. <unk> i assume <unk> is also human. 
we can handle all the <unk> 
every <unk> 
we live in a <unk> where old people are finally <unk> 
what's your name? 
why are you <unk> 
there's another doctor in this hospital. 
i think he can do better than dr. <unk> 
what? 
i <unk> everything they said. 
he's a good man. 
i want a <unk> of her <unk> 
mr. <unk> 
mr. <unk> 
<unk> mr. <unk> 
let's make some <unk> 
let's get a <unk> and trace the <unk> 
give me your <unk> and let's <unk> your vital <unk> 
i'm not really sure what caused it, but right now i think it's a <unk> 
the question is, what caused it? 
and why is there no <unk> 
if you want to make any more <unk> about this, just do it. 
no, that's not necessary. 
well, as we say in <unk> we sit down and do nothing. 
<unk> 
we've done a series of tests so far, and we'll do more. 
so far, the only shot we've got. 
i appreciate your <unk> doctor. 
but these tests have been done a long time ago, haven't they? 
if you stay here a while, <unk> will be able to catch him at all times. 
and i'll check in and see him twice a day. 
i'm going to move in with him till he <unk> 
i'm afraid that's completely <unk> 
how long are you going to take this? 
i don't know. 
i go once a day. 
<unk> 
i'm talking to him. 
i'm coming over and talking. 
i thought if i lived there and died i wouldn't have done it. 
and what are you going to do with <unk> 
<unk> it's <unk> 
you're the only one who can make it, john. 
why don't you take her to the <unk> 
i can't tell you that. 
maybe i should be there when it's over. 
i don't know. 
to prove he's still here. 
to prove that i am his son. 
so what's the positive so far? 
<unk> this man got up every day in his life and went to a <unk> job. 
i never trusted him. 
he did it because he was <unk> and he had no choice. 
you never asked yourself if i was happy or happy. 
i never asked if she had the right. 
when he <unk> this <unk> he <unk> and <unk> 
but i did it <unk> 
john. 
i couldn't resist him, but my mother <unk> him. 
and right now, i'm <unk> 
i was upset because i had a marriage that went bad, and i got a job at <unk> and i barely have a son who can barely walk. 
maybe this will be hard for me. 
but when you die, i will be by your side.
and i killed him, and i covered him. 
and at that moment, i <unk> under the <unk> 
i owe him that. 
when did you get to town? 
i've never been. 
i'm staying with some friends. 
i didn't want to leave <unk> 
you come here every day? 
when you leave, a nurse calls me. 
i'm standing around a half an hour. 
i'm <unk> <unk> 
<unk> dad. 
i understand that. 
why are you here? 
was there an accident or a car accident? 
he <unk> 
yes, he does. 
you sound like a child. 
go, uh, dr. <unk> <unk> 
please, please. 
why are you being so nice to me? 
uh, <unk> one of the hospital, dad. 
<unk> uh, a <unk> 
that's <unk> this is, uh, <unk> 
that's my dad. 
yes, mr. <unk> 
how can i leave you alone? 
i took these <unk> <unk> <unk> 
then we better figure something out. 
are you going to starve me here? 
okay, first we need some <unk> 
remember, i haven't eaten in a long time. 
maybe that's why i'm here. 
you can't do that, <unk> 
all tests are <unk> vital <unk> 
this is a healthy human being. 
i've seen people come out of <unk> before. 
i usually find out why. 
there's some <unk> about it. 
that <unk> <unk> 
like what? 
how can we say that the last time we <unk> the <unk> from the <unk> we trust him, and not talk about it? 
i see. 
you know, when we got home, it was all this <unk> 
but in <unk> it became your <unk> and <unk> that <unk> went back to. 
i think that's better. 
me too. 
they're here. 
what's going on, dad? 
what are you looking for? 
your mother and i are living a new life together, johnny. 
we need new <unk> 
i don't know, dad. 
what do you think mom would say about that? 
you're probably mad and mad at me, but you're <unk> 
i haven't been home in ten years, <unk> 
how about that? 
thanks. 
thank you, thank you. 
ladies, ladies, <unk> <unk> 
no matter how much you lose during the <unk> you lose your <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and almost a <unk> man, <unk> <unk> <unk> 
great jake. 
i beg you to give him a big <unk> 
come on, it's a big <unk> 
moving on. 
and his <unk> <unk> <unk> 
ladies and gentlemen, <unk> 
this is my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
maybe it's <unk> 
this is my <unk> <unk> 
<unk> 
i think we should do this more at home. 
in fact, i was gonna go see a couple of <unk> but it's not <unk> 
that's good to hear, jake. 
wait. 
there's another one. 
i won't ask again. 
oh, <unk> <unk> 
we can't stop them. 
<unk> 
<unk> never killed anybody <unk> 
but wouldn't that be nice? 
i'm telling you, johnny, he's not what he was. 
maybe we should give <unk> a <unk> 
you know what happens to <unk> 
no one believes he's a <unk> who died a few weeks ago. 
i mean being with someone. 
mom, he's just <unk> 
the hole was a golf course, but the <unk> 
wonderful day. 
after the <unk> they took us somewhere. 
that's a good idea. 
maybe mom will come along with us. 
his <unk> got in the car. 
i've run too fast before. 
i hate to think about what he loves now. 
don't worry about your pretty little head, <unk> 
old jake <unk> you'll be safe in <unk> <unk> 
and this is gonna be fun. 
what are you doing on the <unk> 
nothing. 
i want to see if i can still walk away. 
i call it the guy with the <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
are you coming to the <unk> 
coming, but only with a cab. 
i don't want to go to <unk> 
i think we sail in santa <unk> 
that's old people <unk> 
each corner is either a <unk> or a bank. 
i want to drive to <unk> 
oh, i used to eat fish <unk> 
where's <unk> <unk> 
i think we put them in a <unk> somewhere. 
it was 35 years ago. 
i'll go get them. 
he'll be fine. 
johnny, i'm scared. 
he was one of those people that i never met who i was sure about. 
new <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> and now he wants us to go there because it's time to <unk> 
what? 
dad. 
she told you, huh? 
what's going on? 
you drove me in the car. 
john, i need to talk. 
johnny, 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> me, your mother and four children living in a <unk> 
i don't think you have a chance, dad. 
any chance that there's a <unk> <unk> down there? 
i don't have four kids there? 
you, <unk> hank and little <unk> 
as far as i know, dad, you've been living in los angeles for <unk> years.
you had a regular job until you retired from <unk> 
and before that, we went to <unk> and we worked for <unk> there. 
i know you're right. 
i mean, how can you be in two places at once? 
i just want to say, <unk> my life here too. 
i'm sitting in the <unk> watching the <unk> 
stop me if it's too technical or too <unk> 
a <unk> <unk> as <unk> described it. 
over the years, he has had enough pleasure in his daily life, and he <unk> a sense of <unk> 
<unk> <unk> more <unk> than life. 
how long has this been going on? 
hard to say now. 
at least 20 years, maybe more. 
unbelievable. 
just so you know, to do this, you have to have an <unk> <unk> <unk> emotional <unk> 
and where is mom in all this? 
did he get out of this? 
you're wasting time. 
your mother is very <unk> very sweet. 
isn't that the most important thing in the world? 
he's got <unk> 
the problem is your father's place in this world depends on your mother's <unk> 
he's been a happy person since he killed himself. 
his two <unk> <unk> <unk> 
and for years, he brought his <unk> life to <unk> 
if your mother <unk> him, she'll go to <unk> <unk> 
hello, all the beautiful people here. 
maybe i'll make some <unk> on the bike path. 
what would people say if they saw you like this? 
who cares? 
i don't want people <unk> us old <unk> 
and now i know what people will think. 
just ignore what some young people think of us. 
i'm coming with you, dad. 
good boy, good boy. 
don't worry about me. 
i'm gonna go down to <unk> and pick up a few things for the
hey, mom, i told you what the doctor said. 
you're supposed to help him now. 
this kind of <unk> doesn't prove anything. 
he lives another time <unk> 
you should show him that. 
that's all. 
i'm telling you, it's just a <unk> 
nice <unk> wonderful imagination. 
my father is thinking about how you can tell the two worlds right now. 
she's called it. 
i don't care what you say. 
something happened to her. 
this man is not your father. 
i think this is the real jake <unk> 
the guy hasn't done that in 50 years. 
hello.

how's it going with dad?

but the truth is, i was able to find a more <unk> tool that i knew would be interested in <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> 
the last <unk> you brought was a waste of time in <unk> <unk> 
a <unk> can <unk> not only the <unk> but the <unk> 
this victim represents <unk> 
i consider myself a military <unk> not a <unk> 
why don't you leave that man at <unk> 
the man's sword was so <unk> and now he feels this beautiful <unk> 
because if i look at people, i can see both my hands very well, and i can fight both <unk> very <unk>

by men who know how to fight. 
that's what we <unk> 
they're <unk> a <unk> today. 
she's absolutely <unk> but i'd rather go to bed with that <unk> over there. 
please give me something to drink the memory <unk> 
depends on what's in there. 
<unk> is a <unk> <unk> by people who don't know the truth. 
after the <unk> your <unk> will be <unk> 
you ever hear of a river called <unk> 
this so-called thing is the river <unk> 
the death of one person <unk> the door of <unk> 
i saw a man executed today. 
please give me something to drink the memory <unk> 
this is a <unk> <unk> used for a religious <unk> long before <unk> <unk> 
we're known as <unk> <unk> 
what you call <unk> is the <unk> of what once <unk> 
there's been some <unk> recently <unk> that will <unk> the book. 
<unk> ben <unk> was following those <unk> when he was <unk> to death. 
maybe <unk> <unk> secret <unk> 
guy named <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i still don't understand what this has to do with me. 
he was taken against <unk>

fate <unk> you, <unk> 
i'm <unk> <unk> 
then trust yourself. 
and where do we start <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
i already opened the door for you. 
what about <unk> 
he'll be waiting for you on the other side. 
all you have to do is walk out the door. 
<unk> 
i haven't seen you since last night. 
this is <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> the night <unk> was looking for you. 
they say <unk> <unk> himself wanted you.

they said <unk> was a son of a bitch. 
i was also told that you are a <unk> <unk> and quite <unk> of your own <unk> 
<unk> means <unk> of our own <unk> 
<unk> <unk> seems to think that <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> 
his <unk> only <unk> your <unk> 
he must be pretty careful, then. 
a character <unk> <unk> 
you got to be smart enough to pull this off. 
when it comes to miss <unk> <unk> is the last thing you'll ever know. 
then let me tell your dad and make a deal. 
i have some <unk> that i think you might be interested in. 
this is the grand <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> 
when the top part is <unk> the <unk> below it will be <unk> and the <unk> under it. 
<unk> is also a <unk> <unk> 
there will be two men on the <unk> <unk> 
we can't control the <unk> so we can <unk> the <unk> 
<unk> was also wearing a <unk> <unk> 
it's a flight <unk> 
a <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> yeah. 
i believe in people's <unk> and the <unk> that god can give us by <unk> us with our <unk> 
everything i dreamed finally <unk> 
anyone who says otherwise is a <unk> 
about what, exactly? 
i hope it worked as an army <unk> 
i'm a <unk> 
i had nothing to do with the <unk> 
<unk> too. 
two other <unk> have <unk> the way they need. 
<unk> death is the end of the game. 
you need your own help, sir. 
i'll pay you a <unk> 
to see if any of this is true, the truth is... 
shall we say 100 <unk> 
if you <unk> any more, i'll cut out your tongue. 
as you say, sir. 
thank you. 
you're mad at me for <unk> aren't you? 
i gave up everything i could to get to <unk> 
<unk> but i recommend you not to be too smart. 
is something wrong? 
no, sir. 
there's no secrets in <unk> 
how did you do it this time? 
a woman's body is <unk> 
then get back to work. 
there's a <unk> to do! 
i want you to find <unk> <unk> body. 
you need to relax. 
that's what i'm talking about. 
depends on the <unk> 
i'll go to work. 
<unk> family is coming. 
with <unk> <unk> and old <unk> 
<unk> 
the first officer is <unk> for their <unk> 
<unk> is about to <unk> 
welcome to the house of the lord <unk> 
<unk> <unk> is very fond of you.

you're <unk> ma'am. 
no more of this <unk> miss <unk> 
i knew it was you the first time you believed me. 
where do we start? 
you <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
the more interesting question is, why would a <unk> risk her life on a <unk> <unk> 
that's the thing about <unk> right? 
tell me, then. 
i didn't mean to upset you. 
<unk> <unk> is <unk> 
can i see <unk> <unk> 
what's this? 
it's a <unk> to <unk> someone's <unk> 
and under what circumstances would you do that? 
say you're stuck in a <unk> 
we can <unk> this from the <unk> <unk> 
thank god. 
<unk> is clearly right. 
you put our lives at risk. 
maybe it's <unk> 
and to what do i owe <unk> <unk> 
think of the <unk> <unk> and your <unk> as well. 
you're the third person this week to tell me something about <unk> 
maybe you just started hearing <unk> 
now... 
don't make me laugh again. 
this time, remember, you're not the only one who can stop <unk> 
with certain <unk> we can't let you through the front door. 
what <unk> 
i promised you i'd pay first. 
i take it you're <unk> 
i'm trying to tell you, then. 
there's a new player on stage. 
<unk> also known as <unk> 
<unk> hired him to build <unk> weapons. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
i don't understand why this news doesn't concern us. 
these <unk> are different. 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> you're <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
looks like <unk> found himself a new <unk> 
keep watching him. 
see if he's <unk> 
and <unk> 
then we'll burn in hell, <unk> 
along with god's other <unk> 
<unk> 
yeah, you too. 
a good <unk> needs to be <unk> <unk> 
when the bad guy comes at you, you take out a new line in the <unk> 
until he kills <unk> or you beat me up? 
<unk> i didn't ask you to make me <unk> 
i got the <unk> i wanted. 
you can't do that, <unk> 
men aren't always around to protect women. 
besides, what if you're not the guy we should worry about? 
it could happen. 
okay. 
force the guy to <unk> and he <unk> his own <unk> 
<unk> was a little <unk> when <unk> <unk> a deadly weapon. 
ready! 
<unk> 
<unk> 
<unk> 
i was <unk> young <unk> 
thanks a lot, <unk> 
get out of here, <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> why don't you go be busy <unk> 
you don't expect us to live in such a horrible place again, do you? 
nobody wants that. 
<unk> 
this time i hope you stay out of trouble. 
let's go home. 
this is the second time <unk> has returned to us. 
he's worried about us. 
<unk> for <unk> means he has nothing to do with this. 
good boy. 
in the meantime, get out. 
why don't you try <unk> that big mouth all the time? 
you're the captain of the <unk> team, right? 
at least you tried. 
<unk> the <unk> you got from <unk> <unk> to <unk> you. 
i'm so proud of you. 
never hurts to be ready. 
if you think <unk> can help you, why not? 
i was kidding. 
if you want to get to know <unk> <unk> maybe the next time you have her over for dinner you won't ask the rest of us to come along. 
i mean, i... 
it's that <unk> 
i don't think the others noticed. 
still, the last thing any of us need to do is be <unk> 
office <unk> even under normal <unk> 
we live under normal circumstances. 
what are the odds of any of us finding someone who can deal with things that we have to deal with?
i don't know, maybe it's <unk> 
<unk> 
i actually wanted to be alone. 
<unk> tell him to get off her. 
this murder happened a week ago. 
why are you telling me this now? 
how did you get these? 
the police sent these to you? 
they usually wear these when the victim is important. 
he said she <unk> him. 
i was trying to make him proud. 
it actually worked. 
<unk> look who's here 20 minutes before the crime scene. 
what? 
okay, nice guy. 
and who is it? 
are you sure it's him? 
if we can find one of <unk> <unk> we can see his face. 
yeah, that's him. 
now we know why the <unk> woman died to me. 
he died because of me. 
if <unk> is somehow responsible for this, then so am i. 
<unk> 
hey. 
whatever you're doing now, you're not responsible for this, and neither am i. 
but i know who he is. 
you seem a little <unk> <unk> 
long day at the office. 
<unk> <unk> 
i did this! 
i know some of his powers can't be <unk> 
billy was totally mad at me, and you believed him. 
this <unk> is the most important part of the country. 
east <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> wouldn't do anything to them. 
it's not like some <unk> <unk> 
stay out of trouble. 
i don't think <unk> <unk> would be much better. 
how about we sneak in and pretend we're <unk> 
so, you want to be next? 
i think we should stay here. 
why didn't you call me when you were <unk> 
as far as i know, <unk> has <unk> 
i've never loved a woman in my life. 
i just love <unk> 
<unk> 
really? 
you scared me. 
we're taking you in for <unk> 
<unk> read him his rights. 
who are you? 
nobody. 
there's a woman i've never told you about my <unk> <unk> 
yeah, for 12 million dollars we could <unk> a prison <unk> in <unk> 
yes, but for how long? 
an <unk> <unk> of <unk> in a demon <unk> couldn't do much, so my guess, regular <unk> not really a problem. 
<unk> what are you going to do? 
you can't just walk into a police station and wait for <unk> 
there's been an accident. 
before i hit him, i had no idea what that woman was doing in <unk> 
it's not a bad idea to be able to come by and visit a patient at the hospital. 
<unk> some of the blood is his. 
not human. 
he's headed this way. 
we'll take a sample and see what kind of billy is. 
i'll take care of a <unk> 
<unk> daily <unk> 
<unk> 
i don't think you should do this. 
how could i <unk> 
i managed to get <unk> blood <unk> 
maybe we can find out what demon is and how the <unk> works. 
will you send me the glass <unk> 
thank you. 
will you invite me in? 
please, come in. 
i want you to tell me about <unk> 
<unk> <unk> tell me everything. 
what makes you think i'd do that? 
after all, it's your fault. 
i know a thing or two about <unk> 
<unk> side by side. 
<unk> feels responsible for this boy because he brought him back to <unk> 
i feel responsible because he did it to save me. 
in fact, you're totally responsible for this... for nothing, because you're a <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> this spring is not <unk> 
billy <unk> <unk> people. 
then why did you choose <unk> 
others can take hours. 
god, <unk> i hope you're starting to feel <unk> 
really <unk> 
i have to find <unk> 
and i can't help you, why? 
do you remember the guy you hired to get into <unk> 
you know, what he did to me, what did he look like? 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
it's about <unk> 
there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop it. 
your life can be destroyed by someone else. 
and if a woman is strong enough, she'll never be able to <unk> her <unk> <unk> 
where's <unk> 
i understand why 14 years of <unk> did this. 
there's a reason, am i right? 
how many times do you want to talk to <unk> <unk> 
did i wake you? 
he probably left behind telling her how to drive. 
you know these <unk> 
probably deserved it. 
like i said, 
<unk> <unk> here. 
hey, <unk> 
billy. 
i didn't know you were having a party. 
i thought we agreed that you weren't going to come here anymore. 
do you want to, or should i? 
some of the <unk> seem to be <unk> strong. 
these are probably from <unk> demon <unk> 
then it seems that <unk> is <unk> the people of <unk> 
which means it could be <unk> by <unk> or even <unk> 
<unk> where's <unk> <unk> 
when <unk> got out, <unk> thought he was coming out because he was sleeping with her. 
well, i <unk> 
you lie to me again, we're gonna have a serious problem. 
sit down, <unk> 
there's something we need to talk about. 
i'm sorry i didn't tell you <unk> left. 
we still have to make some changes around here. 
change can be good, i guess. 
the <unk> <unk> is like <unk> now. 
<unk> 
maybe your mom and dad never told you what grown men are going through. 
you can't come in here all the time, <unk> like this. 
he actually forced me to pick him up. 
is that what you want? 
stop it. 
you stand up now? 
you put your hair back on the back, close your eyes and then join us in <unk> 
you think you can do anything you want to get in the middle of a place because you belong to life? 
no. 
i'll show you blood. 
what do you call a woman with two eyes on her <unk> 
nothing you say twice already. 
no sense of humor. 
to be honest, i'm calling to kill that <unk> 
come in. 
you have to know the rules about billy. 
everybody in <unk> knows these rules. 
you leave him alone with your girlfriend and you never let him touch you. 
when you want money, drop the table and <unk> 
can you tell me something? 
why did you invite me in after you told me i wanted to kill <unk> 
you're <unk> right? 
billy mention me? 
she said a <unk> guy named <unk> would come here sooner or later. 
that <unk> <unk> 
<unk> 
i know what you're doing. 
who he is. 
you scared me. 
he forced me to find you. 
like a <unk> game. 
you <unk> me with your <unk> <unk> 
but you'll never know, will you? 
no, you just keep running and running away. 
guess what, <unk> i'm not one of your new <unk> <unk> 
i'm a <unk> 
you showed up, didn't you? 
no, <unk> 
<unk> 
you and <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> eat this. 
just a <unk> 
the real problem is <unk> 
why are you telling me this? 
do i know you? 
i thought we should leave. 
the burning <unk> were tortured and tortured to get you out. 
i see. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> woman needs to <unk> all the <unk> that were done to him. 
no, asshole. 
i'm here to take you back. 
i mean, of course, you women sell themselves for money and <unk> but men are just as bad. 
maybe even worse. 
<unk> <unk> even <unk> <unk> for what's under your <unk> 
i don't wear pants. 
in fact, i'm lucky to have an arrow in my <unk> 
and a <unk> <unk> 
i don't think so. 
you don't have the balls to do it. 
<unk> again. 
you won't hurt me. 
no, i won't hurt her. 
i won't hurt her. 
here. 
i would say <unk> hand <unk> blood is <unk> 
you mean the prints on the <unk> downstairs are <unk> blood? 
are you saying i should take it in my hand and make it look like some <unk> <unk> <unk> 
even though i can't live like this, it <unk> me. 
i'd better get out of here. 
lock the door behind me. 
maybe the plan was <unk> 
oh, god. 
you said you would plan <unk> but what's plan <unk> 
plan <unk> 
plan <unk> 
plan <unk> if you don't <unk> i'll kill you. 
oh, god. 
<unk> get out of here. 
all those <unk> you used to get to the surface. 
please go. 
i can't. 
this is my <unk> 
you think that's your problem? 
you know what your real problem is? 
people like him. 
because your power <unk> me. 
charles, you scared me. 
take this and put me down. 
you want me to hit you? 
yes! 
i can't. 
<unk> 
hit me! 
charles, please. 
<unk> <unk> good. 
you can't do this! 
would you like to hear my <unk> <unk> 
about how stupid you are. 
after five years of living in a <unk> i believe i went out to be safe, little dark places as <unk> 
let's finish this. 
i'm sorry, <unk> 
you're sorry? 
you were right about me loving dark places for <unk> 
but you also forget i love <unk> <unk> 
i don't either. 
i mean, you're a <unk> but why the hell would <unk> <unk> you? 
maybe because i'm not human. 
and a vampire never <unk> 
you know those things that the <unk> show up? 
it was always about pain and pleasure. 
i think your <unk> <unk> makes you less <unk> than humans. 
like a noble person. 
i mean, being <unk> <unk> really <unk> 
strange. 
what? 
they're out there <unk> <unk> and they're also <unk> 
i understand that. 
<unk> it's me, <unk> 
does it hurt? 
i left you a bunch of messages. 
i'm so sorry. 
<unk> get back to work. 
how could i <unk> 
but it's time to go back. 
<unk> 
something inside me is getting to the surface. 
oh, god, no. 
it wasn't something in you, <unk> 
it was something that was done to you. 
i don't know what kind of man i am anymore. 
i know. 
you're a good man. 
will i see you back at the office? 
yeah. 
good. 
why would <unk> risk everything to escape the <unk> 
tomorrow you'll return to rome in <unk> 
but i want you to go to <unk> 
a <unk> 
bring <unk> here! 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> and <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i thought <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> he and <unk> <unk> their <unk> 
let me know if the <unk> move out. 
then we must support the <unk> and hope that the <unk> will be <unk> for days to come. 
was <unk> always like <unk> 
the days after the <unk> were filled with <unk> 
<unk> blood is filled with <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> share the same <unk> 
to show the end of <unk> <unk> 
if <unk> is out of his mind, he'll try to <unk> you. 
if i only had my own <unk> maybe i wouldn't have <unk> 
the soviet union was heading toward <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
a whore by the name of <unk> was found dead and <unk> up to <unk> 
that offer <unk> me <unk> 
i don't know if <unk> is helping himself with a case. 
if he had such <unk> why didn't he choose <unk> <unk> 
we can't afford to go to <unk> <unk> 
and to say hello to <unk> in front of a <unk> <unk> 
you really can't be thinking about taking this offer. 
<unk> wants to know what he knows about <unk> because he doesn't deserve to be <unk> 
and when the time comes, we can get revenge for those who have hurt us. 
we keep our own <unk> <unk> 
and to <unk> the right <unk> of death. 
each drop of blood <unk> the blood from us shall be <unk> 
i'm standing here with me now, professor charles <unk> a <unk> <unk> for the fbi. 
are you here to help <unk> find <unk> <unk> 
<unk> we know miss <unk> car was <unk> in san francisco. 
yeah, i was <unk> years old and <unk> that i had to go after for revenge. 
yes, that's true, but each suspect is <unk> <unk> 
you know that <unk> game where you put <unk> <unk> in the <unk> mouth. 
the threat <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> into each <unk> <unk> like the <unk> in the game <unk> the water into each <unk> mouth. 
we need to find a way to get to the point where <unk> was <unk> 
if <unk> wants to get away from him, he has to be <unk> 
<unk> <unk> been making a lot of noise lately. 
hello, charlie. 
your dad <unk> me <unk> <unk> the other day. 
take out the <unk> <unk> and do the <unk> a favor. 
he was closed during the <unk> 
he can walk by himself until he <unk> 
<unk> <unk> same <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
i'll go by myself. 
the <unk> team is <unk> the <unk> we found in her office. 
<unk> <unk> angry male <unk> 
yeah, i'm on my way to <unk> right now. 
charlie, who would do that to you? 
because you were already so worried about <unk> 
nothing happened.

what do you want? 
you don't have to sue me for that. 
i've never seen <unk> before this case.

he managed to keep him in the <unk> but he's probably got brain damage. 
<unk> 
oh, <unk> 
<unk> 
what happened to her, <unk> 
<unk> 
what did you tell him? 
do it now. 
be brave enough to do it. 
i know you'll leave me. 
because i'm <unk> 
because you're about to be with someone as fat as me. 
because you always hated fat people. 
so i want you to kill me now. 
don't touch me. 
wait. 
<unk> 
i haven't left the house in five months. 
all i did was work and <unk> 
without <unk> there's no <unk> 
i can't do anything without him. 
you can't spend your whole life with a man. 
i haven't had any <unk> experience. 
i feel like i've been living in my apartment for 12 years. 
i married her because i wanted her to leave me. 
dump me, dump me, dump me! 
<unk> <unk> and my partner came to arrest me. 
suddenly i heard a <unk> and a man was fighting with <unk> 
i thought you might like her. 
he <unk> and ran away. 
i tried to help, but... clearly my heart was broken. 
did you see the man who killed him? 
no. 
<unk> 
was anybody having trouble with <unk> 
no. 
last question. 
you're that <unk> <unk> right? 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk>

there's a <unk> and a <unk> 
but i guess i'm more <unk> <unk> <unk>

<unk> doesn't like you. 
you should be ashamed of yourself. 
how many <unk> women have looked better than this? 
<unk> 
they all know how great <unk> is. 
that's not what i expected. 
you can't go on like this. 
it's <unk>

i see you dressed like this, and... 
we're going home, by the way. 
do you have other <unk> 
sex <unk> 
no, <unk> 
<unk>

you'll get as much pleasure as i enjoy these <unk> 
what about him? 
did you do something to her?

a beer can bring out things that don't <unk> itself. 
like your <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> really hurt me. 
she always talks about happy and <unk> and another <unk> and another <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
i think i just saw <unk> leave.

one day he came to the wrong group. 
sorry, i think i got the wrong time. 
not the time, the wrong day. 
and he never came back. 
i called him, but he didn't answer. 
then he sends a message saying he left. 
potato <unk> <unk> 
take one. 
what was our deal? 
i only recommend <unk> 
if he <unk> i'll take it. 
i feel guilty when i'm alone

okay. 
you're right, just let the fat kid in the class get away from me. 
fat <unk> how nice. 
<unk> do you like him?

great. 
i'll text him a piece of <unk> 
three <unk> or no deal.

he becomes spanish <unk> and becomes a good <unk> 
he will sing us a religious song. 
okay? 
come on, <unk> 
she wrote it to my friend <unk> 
so marry me. 
what <unk> 
you can't imagine the <unk> <unk> in this <unk> 
no, it's a <unk> <unk> 
<unk> can make beautiful <unk> music. 
i won't let you play ball and listen to this music. 
like <unk> 
<unk> 
okay, <unk> 
are you sure you don't want to close your eyes and go <unk>

i just talked to him and he said you're great. 
i hate <unk> 
<unk> up, <unk> 
come on! 
i hate <unk> too. 
hi. 
<unk> what are you doing here? 
<unk> won't work without you. 
you don't belong here. 
why? 
i can't help you, stupid. 
there are fewer <unk> 
don't pay me. 
why pay for sex? 
you can't have someone who really loves you. 
i don't want to love anybody, understand? 
to find the right person. 
i'm not right for anybody, <unk> 
come on. 
<unk> it's <unk> okay? 
i like men, don't you see? 
go away! 
go! 
why? 
i can't hear you. 
remember when you got home late and you looked like a <unk> and you still <unk> me? 
yes, i remember. 
i spoke to <unk> today. 
you know, normal life. 
okay. 
i'll have something to do tomorrow. 
<unk> i'll be right in. 
you want <unk> 
i want you to go to bed with me. 
and i'm telling you i'm gonna clean up first. 
<unk> 
<unk> not helping you deal with your brother? 
<unk> only think of themselves and perfect <unk> 
all they do is fuck all day. 
<unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
i found <unk> <unk> in the <unk> 
<unk> if you don't like <unk> <unk> 
<unk> all kinds of <unk> 
come on, pick it up. 
a <unk> 
come on. 
and one for me. 
it tastes good, doesn't it? 
i feel different when i was a kid. 
<unk> don't like football <unk> or anything like that. 
because if you're fat and <unk> no one can tell you why you're acting like everyone else. 
no one will ever notice i'm gay. 
but i didn't deliver this <unk> to the <unk> special <unk> 
they let me <unk> <unk> 
and they gave me <unk> 
there was this incredibly handsome <unk> who begged me to stop him from being <unk> 
i don't know how much <unk> makes me happy, when i get stuck in a <unk> <unk> or when he's taking <unk> 
first <unk> is a <unk> 
i'm tired of being gay. 
really. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
and that's not me. 
i've been waiting all night for <unk> 
go. 
you'll have to pay me anyway. 
i'm a <unk> 
it's the worst <unk> of all time. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
i'm a <unk> 
<unk> aren't supposed to be bad. 
we always talked about something we weren't ready for. 
so it's better to get away with them than to see where they lead us. 
because most <unk> are the answer we're looking for. 
put your hands on the <unk> 
close your eyes. 
let's all breathe together. 
<unk> <unk> 
breathe, breathe. 
i thought it was my <unk> but it was okay. 
we all have <unk> 
the first step we need to <unk> what we want or what we want to do. 
i don't know about you, but <unk> 
i did it on purpose. 
i'm <unk> 
<unk> but <unk> 
you can run, but i can't lose you. 
i warned you, but you didn't. 
i warned you, but you didn't. 
<unk> but what do you like? 
are you doing because you want to, or because you want to keep acting like everything's <unk> 
society wants you to be fat. 
if they do, everyone will feel better, because they feel <unk> 
not anymore. 
it's time to take the first step. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
one move, <unk> 
but one day of <unk> isn't enough. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> gives you the support you need on the long, hard road. 
believe me, there's only one way to find out. 
let's move on to stage 3. 
<unk> pure and clear. 
11 <unk> of <unk> 
<unk> 
14 <unk> <unk> 
once again, <unk> <unk> <unk> 
we find ourselves a <unk> <unk> a <unk> or a <unk> bird in the <unk> 
i don't like big <unk> 
let's see.

not exactly <unk> but be careful. 
you could be <unk>

because you are. 
it's called <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
how does a <unk> man feel? 
<unk> <unk> 
my name is <unk> 
we must <unk> our <unk> and return to the past to fix the <unk> 
all i can do is learn from them to be stronger and make them <unk> 
you're the person i want to learn how to be better and happy with. 
we were on our way to <unk> and <unk> 
alex.

what about my <unk>

and <unk> 
what? 
without you, everything will be as it was.

of course you do. 
that's why i said it. 
to get us out of <unk> 
<unk> 
you've known me this whole time, trying to do better. 
i like being with you. 
i'm happy this happened today, because i realized i never wanted to see you again. 
<unk> 
<unk> 
i'm sorry, <unk> 
who goes first, you or me? 
you. 
dump me, dump me, dump me! 
i left him. 
i love you, but i don't love you. 
this kind of relationship <unk> a lot of <unk> 
we decided to stay friends. 
and we were together when we talked about it. 
typical goodbye <unk> 
i wasn't fat. 
nice and <unk> 
light and <unk> 
<unk> has begun. 
maybe <unk> wasn't a good idea. 
we decided to be together. 
every night, <unk> and <unk> came back. 
he wasn't there to <unk> me. 
i felt so terrible that i came on the wrong day. 
sorry, i think i got the wrong time. 
the clock is not wrong, the day is wrong. 
i came to the bar. 
you don't want to go home! 
all of a sudden i realize a man keeps staring at me. 
i thought he was <unk> at how fat i was and i asked him to stop. 
i asked for the <unk> <unk> but he said he paid for the <unk> 
i don't know how it happened, he was with me. 
<unk> <unk> for coffee. 
i kept telling him how pretty i was and he wasn't bad. 
and then i remember thinking about trying new things, talking to other men, looking for <unk> and <unk> 
that's how i met the second guy i ever met until then. 
what can i say? 
it was better than any <unk> 
i wasn't fat if i wanted to. 
of course, the following week she feels fat and disgusting and <unk> again. 
<unk> <unk> 
i needed to be <unk> 
that's how i met the third guy i ever <unk> 
but something told me that <unk> <unk> 
<unk> didn't mean much to me, but i guess i wasn't ready to hear it. 
let's go. 
where? 
to london with your wife and kids. 
where did you say you are? 
this is how i met the fourth guy i ever met. 
it was just like <unk> and <unk> and she had a happy marriage. 
so i decided to keep sleeping with handsome and married men for three <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
this morning, i was convinced i was never gonna see it again. 
what convinced you? 
<unk> <unk> 
i think that's why you slept with all those guys. 
i thought it would be easier to get to <unk> 
if i was leaving because i lost 20 <unk> maybe she'd leave because i slept with 20 men. 
as you can see, there's something i decided to go after. 
what have you decided to go after? 
i don't know. 
i don't know whether to ask you to help me or fuck me. 
or to help me by <unk> 
because i know you're married and you're married. 
how about you, how are things? 
<unk> 
i miss you so much! 
<unk> 
pregnant lady, are you there? 
<unk> 
<unk> 
hi, i'm <unk> 
why would men with a handsome and happy marriage want to sleep with a fat woman? 
i was curious. 
until <unk> stopped <unk> 
so don't worry, <unk> 
what's wrong? 
i'll explain everything. 
everything. 
<unk> <unk> 
if i let <unk> see me like this, i'd have killed myself. 
i'm glad you're not my <unk> <unk> 
stop <unk> 
of course not.

i'm trying to <unk> my wedding <unk> but i can't. 
<unk> <unk>

he'd like that. 
marry me. 
what do you say, <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
you can't do this! 
i've been thinking. 
<unk> <unk> please. 
why would a smart and <unk> woman marry a <unk> 
i mean, me. 
i don't understand.
