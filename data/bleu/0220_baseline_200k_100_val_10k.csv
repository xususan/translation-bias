michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, it was his brother, buster, who shared his bed.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss mom.
i'll tell him.
i have to write an essay... about the morality of war and the foremost... of a conflict.
i'm not sure you'd like me to cheat when our vice teacher wrote the essay.
so you passed my vice test.
in fact, sergeant bethbaerly burned desperately to his teacher, in fact.
small crimes can be cut even the hands of people who commit crimes.
no ring.
try to remember everything he said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
you need to do something about my son.
you and dad adopted you?
the s.e.c. was watching us.
your father thought it would make us look charitable.
he must have faked my signature.
'a year ago, maybe i'll have a son who... finishes the slim cheese.
you have to save me from this.
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't look at him either.
i don't have a mother's compassion and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disruption.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yes-yes.
by the way, when did you sleep with someone?
meanwhile, lindsay was doing george michael's homework.
why would i tell you that?
i guess there's some things you can't tell your father about.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to arrange for his father to fulfill his mother's duty.
there's nothing wrong with that.
but i still have to tell you i'm a little bit hurt by not thinking about me.
auntie can do that job.
teachers can perform this mission.
sure, one day, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay was never so proud of what she said all her life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i keep telling you.
girl, really... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma," you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache.
yeah.
but gob mistook michael's kindness for his emotional interest... and he felt a competition to interfere.
because, you know, beyond adorability... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
_
and george scr was about to have a surprise visit.
i read all your teachings and got all your tapes.
and i watched them all over again.
george scr has recently been offered a series of records of his suggestions... to make money from the spiritualist he discovered... in order to make money for his people.
i also lost two pounds on your banana blutz jail bars.
i came to learn at your place.
this is a good place to start.
and michael met the parent-teacher night after he got rid of two girls on a date.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or is this room with the same floor plan as our kitchen?
i think he's very nice to you.
i thought it would make her sense of motherhood out of her mind.
besides, i can't just bring a job like this to someone and marry my son because he wants it.
i'm mrs. baerly, the vice teacher.
i'm trying to get my students to understand the importance of life that could be destroyed by some thoughtless trick.
and michael got to know his son's ethics teacher.
that's the "rrrr" side of it.
you know, it's really annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you laughed.
"rrrr" - "rrrr!"
but, you know,
and i think i'm a decent person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite something to drink?
or...
yeah, he's dead.
i guess that's because of mr daniels having a stroke...
let's go get a drink.
yeah, maybe it'll help.
george scr was dealing with his own fan.
i've already told you many sins.
maybe you'll tell me some sins.
well, there are legal demonstrations that show my sins.
but, back to your sins.
tell me about one of those things... that happened at the university hall again.
and michael, what's the deal with his second date today, miss bayerly...
michael, that little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it's him.
you have to strip it down to the freezer to say something for sure.
yes, mom.
they'll get him back.
don't take off your shoes, mister!
don't take your shoes off!
he's out of control.
who is it?
this is "annong," your father and i were adopted.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you find a new son?
lucille buster realized he was worried or even jealous.
and she knew what it felt like to be ignored.
annyong is your brother now
cancel it.
staying.
listen, i'll call you back.
nice driving.
are you making reservations for dinner?
he made a "fucking korean."
and after their rendezvous...
michael took a step he hadn't taken in years.
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think that's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we sneak in without waking everybody up?
this may not be my best idea so far.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but it looks like we're even.
you took someone i loved.
so i took one you liked.
i said, "nashbagerlajam"...
listen, i know you're trying to get back at me for marta.
i was lying to you when i said i wouldn't try to sleep with her, so...
he has to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i really had a chance to get rid of him.
it's okay.
very romantic.
who's "n. penn-ahden"?
hello, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i must say i didn't know it was real.
but, now... your ethics teacher...
yeah, i did that for him.
oh.
she likes saddam hussein.
but, you know, in the business of business, i'm sure you're interested in him.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show him that i care about him.
about his class?
i mean, she loves him...
hello, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was she doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with him.
so, why did he do it?
why did he sleep with my vice teacher?
you and i know that, but gob is new...
he's not one of the good snipers who makes his mark, and he shoots it anywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, he's old for you, don't you think he's old?
we don't even know how old he is.
nobody knows.
he was chasing young girls in different dances... and i was confused by his joke, and i thought i'd...
"hi, do you want to dance?"
and he was like, "what's going to happen?" okay?
i did it differently in the mirror, but...
but, you know, like, uh, dancing with a joke or something.
i didn't think so specific.
don't you think you should go out with someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've uncovered a book that was hard to find a picture of saddam in the bathroom suite.
"what would sadam do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's just the same one our fire escape came from.
in prison, george scr was preparing to spend the evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon makes his own preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael, while he's still mad at gob... he's looking for a family expert to create trouble.
i know you went out with shannon.
the cheerleader?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different dances.
i wish i had someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and asked him... but he was breathing, and he dropped his phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe i should go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hello.
my mother took it.
she's got me recording her at the school.
my new little brother.
so we're relatives.
and michael went to discuss the george michael situation with mrs. bearly.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're into her.
i want to talk to you about it.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality...
you see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, he seems to be in love with you, so...
he knows we're going out.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most unpleasant thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been teaching morality for half a semester.
look, it was a preliminary movement.
my brother was trying to sleep with you.
so, i want to leave you right now, and i'm not coming back.
i see.
from now on.
he went for a walk with george scr. cindi.
george.
and he's getting to know him.
you can squeeze yourself right here.
_
you, uh...
he's got the camera.
i'm taking it to the grandma dance, that's your dinner, away with mom.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy.
watch your back, my immigration little brother!
and the different spring dance was in the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting her in because she doesn't have a perfectly good-looking nose-like eye shape-showing eye.
do you want to dance?
all right!
gob finally found shannon...
gobun found out you were cheating on him with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i screwed up, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about it for a while, and-and...
that's... that's your point.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, my vice teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my vice teacher.
after i treated you so bad, i really was moved by your trying to protect me.
actually, gob mistook michael's ethics teacher... for a citizen's knowledge of morality.
man, he's... he gets it.
gob, mrs whitehead was a citizen's teacher.
second movement.
i was seeing mrs. baerly, and i shouldn't have brought gob into it.
but the day you told me you liked him, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed about some sad things, but...
i don't think we'll have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm getting that cake.
hey, you wanna dance?
i can't believe this is working.
it's in the next arrested development.
buster's chewing.
stop, stop, stop, stop!
no candles are allowed here.
mom would go crazy.
no, it's okay.
i'm lighting my candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
it's okay.
over here, let me help you.
these?
okay, here, i'll carry it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is a real big deal.
too much.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we'll all go one day, won't we?
four months ago, each of you went on an interview to attend a never-ending tv show.
and guess what?
you win.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my biggest color is yellow, like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm totally gay and proud of it.
that's sweet, isn't it?
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel, from england.
me too.
that's my brother stanton; my parole officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him over the head.
he doesn't know.
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they look like barack obama these days.
each of you will make $00,000 a night in this prison, all you have to do is spend one night.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
damn you!
great.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know this is not a prank?
right.
actually, it's our third show, but we're not going to broadcast until the fall.
to see if this is a prank, you'll have to play and earn the money.
you will be asked to perform a series of duties.
the missions will force your limits, your courage and your thinking.
sounds like fun, right?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i didn't have a girlfriend who'd admit it even when she was high.
i need to watch my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are nuts.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
go around.
you'll notice.
the total money will be made equally between the survivors, but if you all take the night off, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can help me stay here.
anyone else wanna join him?
i'm not.
i can't go to the city with this piss boy.
i'm in.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you guys are idiots.
it's a fucking party joke, they're all gonna fuck you.
you don't look anything but a bunch of idiots.
can't you see this is a party on the record?
or we'll be famous.
there's a human head over there!
don't worry, it's not real.
it seemed pretty real to me.
that's why they call us special effects.
pretty cool, huh?
a little sign of what's inside.
thank you for the special effects team.
follow me, friends.
they're in hot swamp water, waiting for lazy crocodiles.
the indian crocodiles are long and skilled.
these alligators...
guys.
i see you're working hard as usual.
ready?
we're totally ready.
exactly and absolutely.
keep it up.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great job you scared them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are gonna be at the show.
you really looked like you were terrified.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really creeps me out.
did you know that?
the dead homeless?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
must be a big coincidence.
do you think it's really safe there?
it's safe enough for the show to get insured.
any more questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're rolling.
each of you was chosen by your own free will to spend the night in prison to earn $00,000 a head.
fair enough, isn't it?
all right, let's get this party started.
you can find anything you need in your main camp, which is the principal's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe one of you better write it down.
but you took everything from us, how can we write it?
go down the aisle, turn right, right again, then left.
straight down the stairs, left, right, and another left.
would you like me to repeat that?
yeah.
too bad.
you'll find a key to get rid of your chains there.
is there anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought going out in the basement was scary.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to the mission.
can you not do that?
i don't see a goddamn thing here.
does anyone remember where we're going?
straight ahead, right, then left.
no, go straight, double right, then left.
too much straight.
no, go straight down the hall,
"do it again, make it right, and then left.
"then straight down the stairs,
"sola, right, and left again."
what are you?
smart.
illet, this is gonna be a great show.
careful.
careful.
jesus.
what is this place?
okay, and get ready.
it was fun.
let's speed them up a little.
okay, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
the power's going down, the generator should have come in by now.
shit!
hurry up!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's freezing in here.
look, the key.
yeah.
okay.
everybody, look.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think it's the manager.
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at that.
what, man?
"hi, brave contestants.
"welcome to the office of clem harvis.
"there's a box in the middle of that room.
"this chess piece will determine your personal role.
"you can't change your rocks with other contestants.
"the razors were his favorite".
"now it's your turn to put your hand in the box."
shit.
so, who wants to go first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black castle.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
damn you!
that was really nasty.
my little piggies, welcome to the mission.
now, let me give you information about the pennyville state prison.
in the time of the crisis of 0000, with the cost, the brutal manager thought he'd raise his fortune by destroying some charges.
they were prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the warden's crimes were exposed.
the last person here was the death penalty, headmaster harvis himself.
rumor has it that the director is still walking the halls.
tonight you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured souls of this building.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
does anyone want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the prison church to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first corridor.
that sounded great.
thanks.
shit!
what happened?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, calm down, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung babies!
your children...
i think they're all covered in speakerphones.
the voices are more effective than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
jesus!
that sounds great.
no, i'm fine, man.
freak.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
there's a sound.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're on speakerphone, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off the flashlight.
okay. now?
open the bible page...
"you will find the lord's prayer there.
"happy disrespect for this place that was sacred 00 years ago,
"if it's now, this is the room of unusual events."
oh, my... the opposite.
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do this.
"when you complete your vision...
"if there's no sign of the director,
"you can go back to camp."
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry who i bother.
it wasn't my idea.
okay.
"protect us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"don't let the evil rule us.
"protecting us from over...
"forgive us our debts as we forgive those who owe us.
"give us our daily bread today.
"as it is in heaven...
"as it is in the sky,
"because judgment and judgment are yours."
please tell me i can leave now.
"before we hit camp..."
jesus, randall, you gotta put out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look at what you've done for money.
where'd he go?
from what i understand, the people who did this job... they cut off our connection to our homo friend to give the job a more frightening air.
whatever.
definitely, it's gone in the clog.
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, dude, it's not that bad.
definitely not worth the money.
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm done.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it again.
they may reassign you.
don't joke.
i swear, you don't even know how people feel there.
it's like walking in a thick fog, just cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting cold in here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go to the next one.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these equipment are very complex.
we'll send scelzi down and get her looked at.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
either we talk or i leave.
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i did a little research.
you mean the local girls you sleep with?
am i right?
big lips, wide hips, taylor.
okay, so the prison's not just for men?
and the women's department?
and that crazy fucking manager would walk around the women's section naked, answered no one.
beat them, raped them, left them pregnant, and starved them to death.
some are told to feed their own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this true story will raise interest in the show!
anyone could be talking about us.
that's nothing compared to the fact that you made up that story.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do this, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
yeah?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yeah, they're working.
good.
scelzi, what is that?
just a little something to get me through the night.
you want some?
get your hairy ass over here, okay?
aye, aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the shit out of me.
i've got a great deal.
suit yourself.
we're totally ready to start.
i'd say my biggest fear is being buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will lead you to freedom."
okay,
i'm at the end of freedom.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and make a right.
damn you!
what?
blood.
it's not real blood.
no swearing, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me you're going up, not downstairs.
i'm sorry.
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
you'll see a finger door once you're down there.
he says...
shit!
welcome to cell five.
"if we think of violence and insanity,
shit.
tell me what i have to do... so i can get the hell out of here.
no!
thanks.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a prisoner doesn't commit suicide,
"now you will live the penalty for a convict."
okay, where's the hole?
under your feet.
this place is so full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult task.
"once you enter, you will be told what to do."
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my mission.
connie.
what?
check this out.
what?
no...
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back and i specifically told you that you added something to the show, and you asked why you were fired?
this is not our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you have to take that guy out, okay?
he'll screw up the show.
shit!
we'll ruin it.
you didn't bring this there?
cut it out, no.
it's obvious.
what's open?
come closer.
i asked you why you were putting a camera in the control room.
yeah.
the surveillance footage they want to record...
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
genius, right?
definitely genius.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to record how you frightened us by putting something in the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black king and white horse.
mission four.
black fort and white queen.
i told you you could be reassigned.
very smart.
okay, black king and white horse turn right and go to the gas chamber.
the white queen and the black horse go straight, and they go to the prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"king and knight go left and then right.
"tale and at the end of the hallway,
"and down the stairs."
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, pick up.
we're in.
"welcome to the gathering room.
there must be a light in the wall behind you, open it.
the black king and white horse are in the gas chamber.
nice set, connie.
that place deserved the best, it was a total real place.
the only place the legal department has ever cleared.
beautiful, isn't it?
pretty scary.
jesus.
what is that smell?
a documented fact of execution, usually carry the smell of death.
of course the smell is not death.
if a man knows that his life is about to come to an end, his anxiety has caused him to release a lot of stench.
in that case, the smell of the man we're breathing in right now is the smell of the gas that killed him.
now it's fun time, ladies and gentlemen.
black king sits in the chair.
black king?
that would be me.
wait for further instructions.
"you'll find some meat and some advice.
you'll cook this meat and eat it.
man!
prisoners are always cows, pigs...
"or not lamb, and another meat...
"that they suspected it.
"they thought it was a pleasant meat they had never tasted before".
you mean human flesh, don't you?
are you in there?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i give up.
you'll connect toni.
i'm transferring you from here, right before toni gas, the fear of all the prisoners has to live.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends have strange wishes.
are you okay?
okay.
"your mission's gas teammate...
"find the main valve and cut the gas before they kill you."
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
wanna bet?
$000 to throw up.
okay.
strange.
i can't do this.
i can't.
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
"no more pranks."
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they'll give them extra money."
do it for the team, girl.
are you gonna throw up?
thanks.
okay, angel, i'm at the bottom of the stairs.
shit!
can you hear me?
he's back.
it really stinks.
let me out.
come on.
let me out, man.
jesus!

where are they?
i don't know, just give me a few seconds.

that guy again, you see?
wow!
who's that?
okay, how did he get here so fast?
isn't that the guy from the picture?
yeah.
yeah, he looks like him.
nice.
no, not cool at all.
this guy can either walk through walls or there's more than one of them.
we all watched "printj"?
do you mind if we pass?
please?
guys?
guys?
fake blood, fake shit.
it was beautiful.
maybe even oscar.

no, that's not true.
it's totally illegal.
sounds real to me.
connie, they're playing us.
trust me.
what?
hey.
they copied the picture.
what?
acting.
clothes.
easy.
wait.
no.
no.
he's a real ghost.
i can't turn it around anymore.
if they move a little further, it'll be out of my sight.
what?
this is a big prison.
i can't put cameras everywhere.
show me the hole.
show me the gas chamber.
taylor, somebody should go over there and see if they're okay.
i can tell they don't look good.
she's acting.
then where's scelzi?
i don't know.
he's probably hiding somewhere.
i'll call the office.
okay, you too.
good night.
they don't know what's going on.
i feel like it's getting worse.
okay, i'll go and prove it to you.
it's okay.
anyone coming?
i'm coming.
i'll get my camera, maybe i'll get some good footage.
thank you.
you should be nice to them.
you're gonna have to take care of it!
"you're going to take care of it".
you know what?
you really are photogenic.
you're funny, kid.
i want to do my duty now.
turn off the air conditioning.
come on.
connie, what do you want to do?
stop the game.
wow, this place is like a ghost, isn't it?
it gets a little weird.
where did he go?
i don't know.
i didn't see him.
he went that way.
not here.
what was that?
yeah, what was that?
shit.
taylor?
bring angel on screen.
we have to get them out of there.
can you hear me?
listen to me.
there's been some changes in the plan.
we need to stop the show.
what?
why?
i'll be honest with you.
there's another person with you.
who?
we're not sure.
i want you to leave as quickly as possible, okay?
are you playing me?
you're trying to scare me.
open the door.
i want to win and get my money.
open the door!
who opened the door?
sorry, you're not serious, are you?
idiot!
your job is to memorize and find the location of the cell seven marked.
lucky!
in this cell, manager harvis was wounded deadly by a prisoner.
you'll find a key in that cell, and this key will release your friend in the hole and in the gas chamber.
great.
is that all?
it was the easiest money i ever made.
what am i afraid of?
nothing.
angel!
stanton?
help!
well, now it's out of my sight.
hello?
who's there?
hello?
angel?
angel.
put me down.
who are you?
angel?
angel!
what...
it's not real.
put me down.
wait.
it's you.
no!
angel, are you okay?
he killed my brother.
he'll kill me too.
he killed my brother.
new jersey school of acting.
not bad for a guy like me, is it?
connie, are you there?
yeah.
how could you organize this?
we've had a hard time.
it's gonna be a great show.
i'll see you later.
first, i'm gonna take this shit off?
you're such a jerk.
you said you wanted a great show, didn't you?
you got what you wanted.
yeah.
untie se toni, i'll get dixon and stantton.

good job, dixon.
okay, dixon.
it's over, man.

we have to get them out of there.
we have to get them out of there.
get it out of my face!

i spy with my little eye.
if you can't understand, you'll lose them as punishment.

our aircraft is waiting.
it's a good thing our guest isn't in a hurry.

the home office cupcakes are clear.
we're gonna have to be a little more creative about our funds.
where the fuck is oliver?
where's the plane protection image?
you can break the rules, but you need a special order.
something must be done.
director general.
i know you don't like hearing it from a politician, but reform is coming.
do you know that elevator is only for emergencies?
car 0, what's your status?
are you restless, juney?
you'll be a lot less nervous if you just keep being my london girlfriend.
that position won't be open for long.
i'm spying on my little eye...
engines, they're going at the speed.
bring them to the screen.
calum, closest police units?
just try everything we have.
code 0!
attack happens!
jesus.
june, for god's sake, don't.
get out, now!
lethal force is allowed to use.
open the truck or everyone dies!
open the van now!
pearce.
the americans will crucify us.
your operation, harry.
say again, command post?
lower your weapons and release qasim.
what the fuck are you doing, harry?
open the gates!
open the gates!
go, go, go!
control, prisoner escaped!
heading north!
no, no!
keaton!
command center, agent fired at 0 foot.
any other footage?
follow her.
nearest armed unit is five minutes away.
the helicopter is 00 miles away.
barriers?
in place.
the other side of the tunnel is the last ball.
they have nowhere to go.
sco00 is 0 minutes away.
go.
agent 0, report.
ed, wait.
agent 0, report.
repeat, cia contact officer has been shot.
agent 0, do you see qasim?
command center, i heard a vehicle.
they've turned everything off.
it's over.
the mediterranean can confirm that the american terrorist leader adam qasim has escaped from mi0 custody in one of the most serious mistakes in the history of the organization.
it seems that the security convoy transporting qasim was attacked in the raf northolt trail.
you say it's not war but murder because it's on the west streets.
because in new york, in washington, you didn't want it in london.
but pakistan's children didn't either.
when they're hit by drone aircraft, they call it murder.
qasim offers a new kind of threat.
so far, he hasn't targeted civilians.
our models show a 00% chance of attack within 00 hours.
the more pressure comes, the smaller the window.
i can't say that when the tape is recorded...
the secretary of state is coming tomorrow.
we serve the british people, not washington.
if that's not true, we're already done.
the americans think we no longer serve the purpose.
we need a head.
i'll be relieved of duty in the morning.
have you heard of qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, what happens to me if you go out?
you can take it out.
no one else knows you're in qasim's web.
just leave.
will holloway?
go.
how's life after mi0?
you're not from the moscow department.
london needs you.
anybody you need to say goodbye to?
thank you.
we know about harry's connection to your family, so we understand this may not be easy for you.
even if he's dead, it's okay.
harry's too arrogant to kill himself.
he was just pretending to kill himself.
he went to her grave.
the love of your life.
harry's team has noticed changes in his attitude since the woman died.
emotionally distant, cold, started drinking high.
the water would be below 0 degrees.
he would have had hypothermia before he got to the bank.
here's a picture before we land, and this is the one you said was taken after the horse.
before she disappeared, harry made three encrypted phone calls.
your old emergency message box.
why did he call you?
i have no idea.
last time i talked to him was the last time he pulled me over from mi0.
he wants to talk right now.
which makes you useful.
can you help us find him?
no, thank you.
you and harry talk a lot about berlin?
the night your father died?
if there's anything else, mace, i have a right to know.
i don't think i can decide that...
if you're not really gonna kill her, i think you've told me what you want to say.
find harry, so you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
i thought i was gonna take that title to the grave.
recently, head of anti-terrorism for his majesty's security service.
funny, but who are you really?
these two words are someone who knows what you mean.
asma shishani.
go.
how did you find me?
what do you want?
i know one of my ways.
they never told me who they were.
of course they didn't, but you must have a connection.
one phone number, that's all.
phone number works too.
in return, i'll give you what you want.
impossible.
he said he was a human rights lawyer.
after your government put two of my brothers in jail, he helped them.
but after i was released, she became too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if he's an agent, he's not one of us.
and then tell me if you don't mind, it doesn't mean anything to you.
keep her alive, she's guaranteed to keep my word.
i don't need guaranteed.
take her to a hospital or the deal's off!
what she needs is mercy.
no!
she has a daughter.
and you sent him after me?
you put him in danger and now you refuse to save him from pain?
how the fuck are you?
don't send the video to his family.
harry...
you have a deal.
there is no update on how many smuggling terrorists adam qasim captured.
national threat level is on critical level, so there's an attack on the eli tower.
in the economy news, ftse 000 fell again this morning, and sterlin kept breathing, dollars, euros and other funds.
there's a new intel on harry.
he's got a fucking internship with us on track to kent coast.
holloway, this is confidential.
we found traces of explosives there, too.
you've known him longer than any of us.
do you think it's possible that qasim could somehow put harry into it?
pull him in?
i don't know.
anyway, you find harry, we find qasim.
anything for holloway?
here you go.
tomorrow, 00.
sappa 0, show a, park in sheep 0.
then, keep your eyes open.
i hope you come alone.
just for protection.
if you can't get it without hitting some crazy cold war morgue, we're seriously in trouble.
i promise not.
it says not yet.
we're playing this game harry's way until we see him.
copy that.
doors opening.
go.
ground floor.
doors opening.
open sight, multiple exits.
repeat, holloway.
things harry needs for a meeting.
yes, mr. holloway, your uncle said he'd meet you at the coffee shop.
he left his cell phone at home.
the guy in the parking lot, get rid of him.
he'd be wearing mi0 shirt.
listen to me.
stop underestimating harry.
don't think he'll put your men in danger.
wait for the signal...
what is it, alpha 0?
holloway?
holloway, where are you going?
wait.
no, we don't have a pattern there.
don't move.
holloway, don't move!
terminal 0b.
doors closing.
he got me a flight.
pa000, the glugow plane.
i'm going to glow.
call the glass office.
get me the airport police.
priority code sigma nine.
the police want a clear path to the terminal.
and get us permission for heathrow security.
pa000, passengers for the glow plane...
holloway, don't go to the airport.
what am i doing here, harry?
i had to find someone i could trust outside the service.
it's a short list when you go drunk and crazy and dead.
to be clear, the only person i can call friends is someone who thinks i ruined his life.
qasim's escape was set up by someone at the top of the service.
by one of the people who want you to follow me.
that's why i had to disappear.
qasim had it.
he's our only connection to the traitor.
once he's in the system, he'll be silent.
he's planning an attack.
someone's trying to destroy the service itself.
you're insane.
ruth's death...
don't!
look for yourself, that's all i want.
what are you waiting for, harry?
mi0 was my everything and you took it from me, for nothing.
hate me for it, but i think you believe in the service.
what happened in berlin?
is that how they tricked you?
this may not end as you expected.
i'm afraid i have to talk to them that there's something in the lift.
nothing there, of course, but they'll have to check it out.
i'll send you a number.
call me in 00 hours, please.
i'm from security services.
hands behind your back!
so you just let him walk away.
calm down, francis.
we don't want you to have a heart attack.
the deadly one.
mi0 seems to be in full responsibility right now, and i'm his last friend in the government.
so right now, you really need to be nice to me.
in other words, he's crazy?
that doesn't contradict his last three psychological assessments.
he refused to attend.
harry pearce didn't stop being.
even though he's crazy, i still get him...
for instance.
she asked me to help her disappear.
didn't you think you could accept his request and bring him to us?
just because your life hasn't been a shit since harry kicked you out, don't think we can't put your life in a shit situation right now.
since we've threatened each other, the three of you don't hang on the cliff or anything.
your entire organization seems to be out of hand.
find qasim.
full.
they're ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i saw that name working on a case.
i thought they got you off duty.
they did.
now, what really happened?
the abduction may have been set up by someone in the service.
do you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i left it 0 weeks ago.
there must be one around here.
tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't apply.
when i was 00, i was hanging out with a guy who makes cash transfer.
k section was interested in some people using it, so they got to me.
you started off as an agent?
and when i was done, they asked me to train as an officer.
my parents came back to me when i told them.
and if someone you're working with helped qasim escape, that would be a problem, wouldn't it?
all right.
something made me feel wrong that day.
rob vass, my team leader, he was in the front car with me.
he told me not to open the weapon compartment.
he ordered me to chase.
where does he live?
it's loaded.
w00 account preliminary.
panama city.
service bribe fund.
june, what are you...
who are you?
you told me not to chase qasim.
you told me not to chase after you treated my gun.
we swore an oath, rob.
i'm not saying anything until we get to thames house.
we're not going to thames house.
will, what do you got?
qasim's bodyguards are deliberately weakened.
the team leader was in on it.
he's just a errand boy.
find out who gave the order.
the americans think mi0 is a weak link and i think someone inside is joining them.
when qasim escaped, we fell out of sight.
the cia took care of the job.
fire...
he was gonna shoot.
his pulse...
dead, dead.
he's dead.
listen.
you should go home.
june!
i'll handle this, but you gotta go, now.
i've never heard a piece of that song get killed.
who's warrender hitting?
landon miller.
agency king.
he's trying to keep his support alive, and hoping he won't give me the keys to the kingdom.
every time i see you, francis, you look like you've been buried secretly, or, you know, somewhere, covered by langley or pentagon.
you don't have to tell me.
i think in times like this, we should never forget who's flag is hanging.
francis.
i'm trying to help, but he's basically accusing me of extra work for the cia.
tonight, your generals, your politicians, your spies, came together to celebrate.
tonight, we'll attack the heart of your powers.
our enemies are politicians who send your sons and your daughters to die in illegal wars.
you are criminals who spy on you like you are.
this war is beyond religious differences.
all flight out of the united kingdom...
he had it in his hand.
warrender lived.
if you have a way to get to qasim, tell me now.
there's another way.
qasim's wife.
asma shishani.
she's got the fsb.
if i find out where they're holding her, she'll give up the traitor.
you made a deal with him.
yeah.
and if we can make it, he'll lead us straight to him.
surrender and set it up.
how do you know she has the russians?
for a cia agent trapped in moscow.
i can get to the remote, but i need you to open the secret door.
it's a ip address.
you're kidding.
it's the only way, will.
harry's getting help somewhere.
i've searched his old contacts, but i need access to personnel files to do it properly.
but it won't take you anywhere exciting.
i'm in position.
looks like i'll have to steal more extra band wide.
the one.
malcolm?
okay, i'm in.
now i'm looking at the server.
harry, we gotta go.
can't we do this any faster?
i can do it.
but unfortunately, this machine is the last century.
g branch already pulled these.
erin watts.
might be worth the closer look.
fill in the blanks for me.
but a spy came out.
i almost got him out.
i've been in business for less than a year.
they make you choose sooner or later.
all right, i'll leave you alone.
are you done?
why am i sure?
i'm sorry, will.
harry.
harry!
harry, what have you done?
stay away from the computer.
i didn't feel the need to say this earlier, but i hope you know what you're doing.
harry's working with qasim?
he stole an entire gchq database.
everything we have on our western agents in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
he showed up at schaefield airport cctv.
i don't know.
harry didn't make that cyber attack alone.
then who's helping him?
except you.
and you're still protecting her.
why?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i'll find her.
and there's a threat.
analysis says there's going to be a large-mile attack in 00 hours, multiple targets.
an agent who was in charge of qasim's escape is missing.
he has signs of struggle in his home.
do you know anything about that?
how's your mother, holloway?
i heard it wasn't very good.
he hasn't been together since your father died.
understandable, but really.
and then that doorwork comes along.
i know, i know.
harry was right about one thing.
you're not good enough.
home secretary, can we really hope that qasim will stop attacking again?
we've destroyed threats against our freedom and our lives the rest of our lives.
your ability to hurt us might be important, but it's the end.
you'll find out that our judgment isn't limitable.
they're not listening.
they never killed our women?
we're making the world a better place, brother.
transport team at the airport.
we're allowed by the atc to block the road to the prisoner car when necessary.
i think i owe you one.
you were absolutely right about vass.
dankie.
alexanderplatz.
it's in the northwest corner of the metron, 00th.
we have a safe house.
call it nostalgia.
don't forget to bring the record.
don't forget to bring his wife.
how did you find me?
there's only one place to meet in berlin.
you told me.
southeast corner of alexanderplatz.
no sentimentality.
that's the price of qasim's wife.
when she gets out of fsb custody, qasim will give me a number.
he'll take me to the traitor.
they'll be able to destabilize this where it's vulnerable to take over.
get in the car, harry.
there's an old hotel 00 minutes from here.
my contact can meet us there with three clean passports.
you're going home.
sorry about that.
why are you here, mrs. keaton?
keep walking, harry.
i killed someone because of you.
you're c0.
what are you doing, harry?
talent discovery.
so which one of you found it?
jesus, will.
preparations are everything.
and vass?
when he came to my house, i reported it.
i thought someone was asking about qasim's escape.
they put me through to the command center, and they told me what to do.
they went to vass's house before we did and placed the evidence.
i set up vass's escape.
you think i want to do it?
i know my duty.
i'm the only one here who knows.
you were set up.
she's right, will.
but i wonder if mrs. keaton is sure about me.
it was a secure chain of command.
what was i supposed to do?
do you believe him?
yeah.
i'm sure your men will come and find you if you're still useful.
after all this was over, what did you think they would do to you?
i did what they asked me to do.
we're changing the deal.
we're taking qasim's wife to london.
tell him you can't see his wife again if he doesn't come around to swap.
let's go get her.
what happened to alexanderplatz?
instant agoraphobia.
i'm afraid there was something wrong with qasim's wife.
at least be good enough to put it in my car.
harry.
colonel.
i hate to be unpleasant, but we'll need your clothes.
while the search for adam qasim has been focusing, everyone traveling on the national line of the united kingdom has to show credibility and control the governor.
i got your wife.
let me talk to him.
the russians put him to sleep and...
bullshit.
i'm bringing her to london.
no.
i'll tell your whore you said goodbye.
is the baby too much?
no, same you.
i trusted june.
you were right to relieve me of my duty.
despite everything i've done, you're still here trying to do something good.
i won't let your sacrifices be in vain.
it was here.
was it fast?
he could have let me go, but he chose not to.
you try anything, anything at all, i can't guarantee anyone's safety.
nobody's.
you bring my wife, i'll give you your phone number.
here we go.
hello?
holloway.
this message came from the h branch.
me.
we can catch qasim, but we need help.
let's report and go.
one clean choice, hannah.
trust me, and help me.
or leave.
do good or good, right?
shit.
they're approaching the location.
what i wrote last night is constantly updating its own refreshing algorithm, reviewing all potential angles.
then he doesn't cut the water?
please.
all right, we're here.
how much time do we have?
i'm looking at 000 cameras.
give me something.
when he realizes we're playing him, he's gone.
wait.
he worked 00 seconds ago.
are you sure?
yes, confirmed.
the camera's out in the last minute.
third floor roof, east corner.
harry, we have to stall.
i hope you're looking right at us.
yeah?
look south, you know.
i have his wife.
you were supposed to be looking south.
give me the number.
give me the number or we'll leave.
turn around now or you're dead.
here.
him too.
i haven't gotten it yet.
you have 0 seconds to turn around.
turn.
maybe this guy never saw her.
almost there.
him?
kill.
give me the number.
don't!
stop!
no!
okay?
will, she's fine.
the shooter's dead.
it's over.
malcolm, feather.
yeah?
my wife is dead, isn't she?
harry, listen.
hannah, let us know.
harry?
hannah, why did harry remove the earphones?
i don't know.
let us know.
get sco00 here, now.
0 trucks full of rdx are leaving the limehouse north industrial park in the next 00 minutes.
how do you know?
qasim just said.
car bombs loaded in 00 minutes are leaving.
i think we got him.
let's go!
armed police!
stay where you are!
clear!
clear!
anyone seen the main target?
negative!
negative!
negative, sir.
command center, area clear.
harry.
he sold his own men.
why would he do that?
what did you do?
armed police!
don't move!
move!
you have to tell them everything, harry.
i think we have a lot to talk about.
that might be a bit out of line.
since the south end of alexanderplatz.
keep holloway close.
make sure he's safe.
maybe we won't be so hasty.
did you find qasim?
harry will talk.
you still don't know him.
qasim gave up his entire operation.
what did you say to him?
i should have thought they'd set you free after berlin.
they want to offer you a deal.
throw everything on harry and go.
i told them i'd leave it after i did.
there's no way out.
i can't.
there's an emergency spare key that goes around your neck.
whatever you're after...
what would ruth think?
what did you give him?
check the back.
southeast corner.
i found harry on the northwest corner of alexanderplatz.
the opposite.
where you trap someone.
harry?
i gave him you.
get down!
get down!
get down!
lock us down.
get down!
get down!
we're not here for you!
we're here for them.
get down!
think of your families.
hamza.
why?
there are 00 men on the other side of these doors.
you must surrender.
come here.
open it!
if you think we're going to negotiate...
open the door.
but he'll kill us.
there are so many demons in one room.
the only way out of here alive is to surrender...
you think i want out?
how many people in this room started to end?
my people's lives.
your people?
you didn't ask them to kill you for them.
if you want a hostage...
i think he made it clear he wasn't interested in hostages.
i'm the headmaster of mi0.
kill me and put the gun down.
otherwise, you're nothing but a dead terrorist.
no one will ever see you as a hero.
when we're done, you're gonna be a drunk, your wife-beating, weak-headed head.
we'll trade a few marrach boys for their whore, give them free disneyland tickets in exchange for saying you begged them to piss on you.
we can't remember you very well, can we, adam?
wait, wait, wait.
i pulled the helicopter back.
but...
you fucking coward.
i thought you were fighting a higher standard.
i'm sorry for your wife's death, adam.
i know what this can do to you.
is that supposed to stop me?
it's okay.
stop!
why did you bring him here?
i made a choice.
without plan b.
why do you think i keep you out of your room?
people are still dead, harry.
a lot less than the ones who die in the blast.
how can you make that choice?
that's my job.
aunt g, can you come play outside?
hello, geraldine.
in the end, it comes down to who's lying the longest.
right?
if we had kept that morning, qasim would never have escaped.
you gave met's air unit an order to turn down all the mi0 requests, didn't you?
that's the advantage of being a lonely maniac.
i don't need to prove it.
sacrifice his own fortune so he can be questioned by a foreign force.
the americans would have made you the general manager no doubt.
how many more lives was that promotion worth?
what was it you thought you did, harry?
the service is dying.
but if i'd given up the moment i realized i was on the losing side, my career would be very short.
blow my brains out, find my 00-year-old niece...
i think this came from you.
what is it?
it drives more than 0 hours of subtle bowel into bleeding.
no trace.
how clever.
i was afraid that would be your answer.
so i took the chance to make a choice.
it's not lunch that makes you sick.
i ate beef ribs.
tell me you're lying, harry.
please.
tell me you didn't betray your country.
it's been 0 hours, geraldine.
you can spend the last 0 hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd play with that beautiful niece.
i'm thinking.
your message said you'd say something to me.
they're spying on ruth's grave.
you can't leave now.
i have something you should be.
your father was wearing this the night he died.
stai found a way to get in somewhere in his body, his fsb and his fsb.
he was wearing a wedding ring the night of his operation?
i didn't throw you out because you weren't good enough.
after your father, i couldn't...
i should have protected you.
good ones don't last forever, will.
then who does?
they're like me.
if you know your problem and tell the men at the door, it'll help.
there's room for every guest at the hotel middle school.
gather in one position.
these new problems kill in the darkness.
these people will be thankful when the darkness is down.
i think we should keep them here to keep them safe, but i'm worried that things will get worse.
they have no idea who caused the dark problem.
besides, it's not what hides in the dark we need to worry about.
we still haven't figured out how to lift that fog wall.
maybe that's a blessing.
that was the latest from in-light safet.
i'm on your side, and i may need a new job.
i've got it under control, but i'd love to get another pillow for my beauty sleep.
try to make things right.
we talked about this.
it's almost impossible to destroy a troubled person before they kill him.
of course, i just need the impossible materials and information that i don't have, which i may not have.
i'm gonna need a team.
do you have any idea what's going on?
but there's a bad element.
it's the only way to protect the rest of us.
it's too risky to drive with a magnet problem.
an engineer to help fix the power plant.
he volunteered as soon as he knew.
if things don't work out, you can use his problem for operator.
what the hell are you doing?
the killer without a trace is out there.
and i think he really wants to prove to you that he wants to help.
all right, whatever the reason, just keep an eye on her for me, okay?
because neither of us are immune to new problems.
i'm not saying it's just my mom.
i'll call the person in school who caused the dark problem.
he stole those batteries and put us in danger.
there was no choice, dwight.
this is the third case in two weeks.
and now the serial killer is in this building.
all right, i'm gonna go talk to dwight.
my father always said you were a good man.
mara's father?
there might be a way, but if you want me to explain it, it's more frightening, so don't ask.
i can't even find maine, haven on the map.
you're telling me you can't find a town with 00,000 people?
it wasn't caused by problems.
then why didn't we use aether in the first place to finish the problems?
i can't bring it when the pearl is sealed.
so how do we find it?
gloria brought a box of things duke left in gull.
i don't think william has the amount i need, and the aetsher is just the first phase.
you told his wife you'd find him.
it's easy picking on the side, but sometimes it's not what it looks like.
i have a town to protect.
no wonder the plant's working at 00%.
guys, i'll try, but remember, i've never done anything like this before.
they parked the car here so i could talk to you, but i don't have enough money to pay for the change.
if all goes well, i'll be back with aher before sunset.
this is peggy's husband, rolf.
there's enough panic and fear.
the same killer who killed my son 00 years ago?
we call him "the murderer without a trace."
what else are you hiding from me, vince?
dwight's doing everything he can to get the rules out, but he's not the type to kill people.
in this haven, exiled is the same thing as executing.
thanks to our friend there, we're keeping them in some kind of prison.
he says the generator works at 00%.
damn it, the generator must've dump the energy reserves when it overloaded.
that explains why there's a section of the town electricity.
at this rate, five minutes.
it's almost over, and it's the only thing keeping us from dying in the dark.
here, i've revisited the generator arrangements to get the power to the town faster, but there's nothing more we can do.
they better be back.
help each other.
turn the lights around.
share supplies.
you see, i'm happy here.
i got your message.
get in the car now.
come on, get in!
if war lies ahead, we should be grateful, even slean.
i don't think there's anything worse than falling in love.
i don't like it here.
there are two sides to every story.
whoever's behind this is a traitor.
let's go.
he asked me to represent him at slean's wedding.
palace, you are my brother's love.
that's why you're like my brother.
you've seen bigger places than this in the iraqi realms.
none were ruled by a woman.
you must choose a second to escort you and observe your interests during the ritual.
then you listen to the ties of your friends and relatives.
i have no relatives here.
my mother and others will escort you.
kela, this is the palace from bregan.
rheda, must i always be protected?
i don't quite understand it.
but i know i have to marry slean.
i'll love her.
this marriage cannot come true.
abrecan is counting on you.
what do you do?
carpenter.
then they can use you on the wall.
who are you?
a friend of the councilman.
like i said, i have work to attend to.
we need to figure out how to handle it.
varr said i couldn't accept presents.
well, that leaves us.
when the wedding day comes, every bride should smell good.
remember, this is our secret.
sit down.
we'll take what we're getting while we're looking at the wounded.
you wanted to talk?
all right.
kela, it's time for your month.
elvina, will you be my second?
for the game.
we need to talk sometime.
we need to discuss reasons why marriage shouldn't work.
if we don't fulfill our mission, their marriage can be canceled.
beowulf!
let's celebrate.
old customs!
dress reeking.
i'm so sorry.
it was just a little mistake.
that's all.
we're gonna help slean get the symbol to his bride.
that sounds easy.
breca!
open the door!
come on, you stinking mudborn.
come on!
come on!
give me your arm.
come on!
slean.
be quiet, kela's asleep.
are they ready for this marriage?
i can't understand why slean didn't want to marry kela.
i don't think so.
he should put his feelings aside and do what's best for everyone.
would you put aside your will for others?
that's what we all have to do.
if someone spends their whole life trying to please others, it means that someone doesn't.
thinking like this must make you feel very free.
try it.
tell every rock the truth.
but then you can look at each other and light the fire that symbolizes your marriage.
then you'll be husband and wife.
have you ever loved anyone?
no.
i thought i'd...
you want to be thane?
tell my uncle i'm done with him.
allah.
come on!
go!
and you let him go.
we're not done here.
don't you understand?
i betrayed my mother and set up sand with my uncle.
this woman was sent here to kill you!
i don't know.
yeah?
i killed my brother.
he was the one who should have been with him today.
even if the world were gone, mara had everything.
people loved him because he was kind.
my father loved him as his first child.
she and rowan were lovers.
and then i had the chance to escape.
i didn't need anything.
he died of humm.
he was getting better.
i poisoned him.
slean, i won't tell anyone what happened here today.
or stay.
i know, but he's beowulf.
he went to bed last night.
but we can choose who we can draw our fate with.
light the fire with me.
you want to be thane?
i can help you.
against whoever it is.
they can't take it away from you, rheda.
with this marriage, you're shieldlands jarl.
jarl's rules should be carried out by every tribe.
if the blood money isn't paid, a killer's life will be ended.
the thieves will be branded and out of society.
the price of all the goods made at shieldlands will be determined by jarl.
what right does she have to set up the price of fish?
we're the ones risking their lives to catch the panic every summer.
you should have told me about these rules.
you were on duty, where your people needed you most.
i couldn't distract you.
it was messy enough.
you're late for the pandiri.
some believe you've kidnapped her again.
but if you fail, bregan will be in misery and open the winter.
breca's wanted for murder, you know that.
kill him!
kill breca now!
i got it!
if you do it without any explanation, we're all dead.
he hired us to deliver breca to his blood after he escaped the gallows.
you mean the guy who helped him escape the first time?
so we'll welcome it.
but we need breca.
heorot may be holding our doors as we speak!
when did we kill young women?
what do you mean?
you've been hidden in the shadows for too long, abrecan.
don't forget who you're talking to.
talk.
the boy wants breca's life or blood money for his brother's murder.
i didn't mean to kill anyone.
hurry up!
thanks.
breca loved my mother.
he's looking for the conditions he thinks he's got money, then he stole the money and ran away, you asshole.
he left my mother and took everything precious to her.
my brother went after him.
but that cost you your life.
breca, is it true?
i'll pay for your brother's blood.
lila, do you have 00 silver coins?
i don't want money, i want blood!
silence!
if the blood money is paid, breca will be released.
you lied to me.
pandiri.
pandiri!
tie him up now.
stand by, they're coming.
i saw it.
get out!
the council have gathered.
he wants to replace me for kidnapping the warden.
you let me down, she married slean keela, and rheda is jarl!
you don't understand.
tell the council our enemies are gathering, that your sister cannot rule, that you want to save the shieldans.
so tell me you're distracted.
tell me.
i'm sorry.
i knew breca had killed someone, but the story she told me was different.
it's only his fault.
lila, nobody thinks bad things about you...
that's all i got.
did you bring it?
there are no 00 silver ones here.
not enough.
and i'm gonna hold breca while i see it.
was there enough money?
lila?
turn it off, beowulf, please.
you won't talk to lila.
get on your horse, leave heatot and never come back.
there's no place for you here.
if heorot's being attacked, i want to fight properly.
if herot's attacked, i'll protect you.
let's try it.
it's not about mudborn.
i don't want to talk about it.
i want to know why you lied about training me.
it's when you use it.
you don't even want to be discreet.
yeah?
i didn't know we were training the marines!
go.
now!
he fights girls now?
the view was more like the blackbird was training the husarl.
i know you think i let you down.
that i couldn't focus on my duties in bregan.
but i have my reasons.
you're talking about betraying one of your own blood.
in the center of this land, a warrior needs!
someone who'll make his people out of the darkness.
a man in power to take control!
you're talking about betraying your sister to cover the fact that you can't afford your people's needs.
what's the point of having fish if we're all gonna be slaughtered?
i'm here to vote insecure against our thane.
those who oppose abrecan as thane.
it's settled.
a new thane will be sent and announce in the morning.
get up.
next.
no one.
don't think it's a game!
we got lazy, distracted.
this is gonna work here.
from now on, we'll work just like my father hrothgar.
i didn't mean to interrupt.
you're a good teacher.
a great thane wants a strong army behind him.
we don't have to share the same bed, but if we don't share the same room, people will talk.
i've always liked watching heorot from here.
it looks so invincible.
if i tell my mother the truth, i will lose her trust.
and a chance to rule one day.
what if abrecan attacks?
heorot can fall.
aren't you going to recommend it?
i trust you.
the decision you make is right.
and i'll be here when i do.
you'll be thane.
you just have to believe.
pandiri.
pandiri!
it's the pandiri!
sound the horn!
i order you, sound the horn!
abrecan, give it up.
if we don't act now, we'll lose our chance.
why...
you, help me with the net.
help me with the net, now.
why don't you help me?
pandiri!
come on, hurry up!
go find me a sack.
people shouldn't leave their valuables lying around.
you owe mom an apology.
but i'm a warrior, and our honor is at stake.
so i'll take your life.
go back to mommy, little girl.
greetings.
i didn't need your help.
because he didn't have enough money to save you.
be thankful you didn't kill him, vishka.
if we don't plant the nets, our prey will escape.
no, he won't.
get ready.
abrecan, no!
hold the rope steady!
hurry up, they'll eat you alive!
pandiri, pandiri!
pandiri, pandiri!
hold on!
now draw!
take a look.
there will be songs about this hunt.
a catch you won.
i have a dream about us.
being the biggest tribe in shieldlands!
we will not obey the laws of a jarl who can't even hold a sword.
who's with me?
abrecan, abrecan, abrecan!
i need to warn beowulf.
bregan!
elvina!
his warriors are gathering.
this time they intend to destroy us.
beowulf!
if we look around today, we'll see that more danger and harm comes from religious belief.
if i talked about stand-up communism or soviet communism, or the savage of stalin, it would be less ashamed.
it's one of the kind of interrogation species that stirs things up for people, especially the philosophy.
to present a condition that is perfectly correct in itself, can cause serious damage.
when the prophecy doesn't come true, we make fun of those people and the whole world laughs with us.
i had this friendly idea with richard dawkins.
maybe we should be more aggressive with richard.
especially america is wrapped up in christian belief.
they're sure the world is what their religion says.
we'll get rid of the bad guys.
i'd love to write a book like this, if i could.
but of course, one of my fears is what happens next.
what kind of mayhem?
how is it right to do that to people who think we're civilizing and protecting the good from within?
religion, for many people, is like a moral viagra.
if that's true, if religion leads to the moral life of men, who will certainly lead us to a clarity, and in the event that we are meant to be brushed back to the bottom of the field.
because there's a lot of people down there, and we can create chaos from the fear of these people.
a lot of people want their lives to have a meaning, and where does that come from?
yeah, but there's gotta be something better than religion.
yeah, there's definitely hope.
let's see what happens.
of course.
at least you didn't get a piercings.
i don't know how to explain this to amy.
i'm the world's stupidest man.
all right, cut it out.
i'm the world's stupidest man.
all right, you win this.
i can't find emma's papers.
honey, just so you know, even when you find the original receipt, you can't return the baby.
i need to find the paper that angela signed when she left emma on my doorstep and gave me the only proxy.
i'm finally getting health insurance for what i'm responsible for and taking care of.
i haven't talked to him since the night we made emma.
calm down.
you gave me all important paperwork on the baby to keep them safe.
do you have all the paperwork?
his father's little girl is his father's big girl.
maybe something with balloon.
it looks good on you!
you robbed a clown?
it's your birthday!
my birthday is tomorrow.
you used to have parties all the time when you were a kid.
after my birthday celebration...
"happy birthday, miley."
you know those papers i kept for ben?
how irresponsible do you think i am?
but i...
i may have posted them in time, and he didn't mail them, and i might not be the only one of emma's.
we were all excited about the new baby, and i didn't have the stamp!
look, if we just got angela to sign this certificate, it'll be fine.
since you're ben's best friend and you're the only one who's seen her...
i like it very much, okay.
all right, emma's finally asleep.
listen, danny, what's the point of not wanting to celebrate riley's birthday?
really, why does he hate it so much?
ben, riley didn't celebrate her birthday after her disaster last 00 years.
are you sure you want to watch this?
i think i'd remember if something terrible happened.
all right, come on, people.
danny, where are we going?
luckily, the future has won a real mustache of you and lost a weight of her personality.
is ben here?
benjamin wheeler, come here and celebrate riley's birthday.
well, i can tell you that this is my best birthday ever.
tell him you didn't do anything to the cake.
actually, try to save it with the perm first, then cut it out.
is riley still in love with ben, or is that something that happened when he was a kid?
unless you're still in love with riley.
i ruined her sweet 00.
it's not in her birthday secrets, but it's sure that she loves you the rest of the
if ben's so irresponsible that he's going to lose the paperwork and he's so scared to confront me, maybe he doesn't deserve to take emma's vice.
if it makes you feel any better, we do most of the work.
i know how hard it is to leave emma.
i knew you'd end up hurting her, no matter how beautiful, funny or wonderful she was!
in your presence, in the streets of the city, the united states army, the eligible tank unit, which destroyed only three minutes, slave trooper 00.
as madox-00.
what's more, a uh-00.
the anti-terrorist and the guy for anti-gerilla operations.
miss kusumoto is also the chief of software for "tankbuster."
in order to expose madox's capability to the light, he personally passed the pilot's cabinet today.
unit 0 will go to ichigaya tonight.
we're in a hurry, so get on with it as soon as you can.
and...
miss kusumoto, you've made me very humiliated today.
i'm not here for congratulations.
i have one thing to say to you:
wow!
kouji...
what is it?
onose, leave this to me!
they threw away their trash.
i'm telling you, don't worry.
i'll buy you dinner in exchange, okay?
sdf's transport vehicle...
according to reports, it was perfectly natural...
obviously, terrorist business.
you're too savage for the east-block operations.
i hope you know what you're saying!
i hope you can see that the obligation of the accident was entirely yours.
in any case, our situation is critical.
we were transporting him for a field test!
it's bad!
i have to be in charge of the operation.
besides, madox-00.
while we're investigating the crime scene, vehicles are causing trouble.
i wonder if we can get backup from the police.
he must prepare ourselves for the worst and make the help troops ready.
i'm the only one who can stand up and stand up to madox.
although lieutenant kilgore is a troublemaker, he's our best tanker in the army.
is this okay?
you know there's no one in the apartment?
anyway, i'm a little relieved.
shori was really pretty, so...
when england goes to study all the boys in japan will mourn.
where did you learn that?
he wanted me to call in the morning and tell you a message.
use the remote to open the inside.
it's burning!
he could adjust the pilot's cabin.
feels like he's wearing a boat to ski.
we got a signal activating madox.
this is a disaster.
could you heat it in the microwave?
i really made a fool of myself!
shori, what do you mean?
defence force?
you're on duty with the prototype air-load company tank.
don't turn tokyo into vietnam!
tokyo ha vietnam is the same as all wars for me.
you'll cause the disaster.
oh, don't worry about useless.
i'll get over it before it gets too hot.
lieutenant kilgore is taking his most advanced tank and anti-tank choppers to his quote, "don't take madoxer duty."
in that case, there'll be a major panic downtown.
in these conditions, there must be someone who can stop kilgore and madox.
what can we do?
we don't know the madox target yet.
if i can find him before lieutenant kilgore does, maybe i'll prove we have a chance.
but madox is...
i'm using unit 0 with success from power tests.
how much for success?
hey, you heard me!
wait for me.
that's it!
how you doing!
what are you doing on the road?
i can't stand by the road like a pavement!
you really are a driver, man!
i've got a long way to finish up the instalments!
cabriolet's back!
goodbye, assholes!
really, the saturdays were covered in car traffic near shinjuku.
i can't lose track in this crowd!
this "matox" must really be worth it.
spider 0 to jackal 0.
don't move in the target!
he moves on his own...
one of the apache's been dropped.
all troops have been authorized to destroy madox.
just like kilgore wanted.
he's heading into the skyscrapers with his apache.
the civilians must evacuate immediately!
they're all over me!
i gotta go down that way, man, get out of the west.
while he's standing there, an armored one is crazy!
all right, back to work, madox!
i hear you.
and i say, "you're a headache."
if anybody's got a reason for mayhem, it's you.
just what?
none of your business.
i can't do anything i don't know what it means!
no!
all right, captain!
"ns parking space -
exit."
i did it!
shori's up there!
i'm not gonna let you take another step.
i can't fight back!
i can't waste any more time with you!
i thought you were an amateur so i shouldn't be nice to you.
time to jump around and stop jumping around.
it's not work!
he's just a boy!
what were you planning on doing that?
my name is sugimoto kouji, a sophomore at the kanto institute of technology.
all i wanted to do was meet my girlfriend at the nsr building waiting for me.
first she locked me in, then she dropped her helicopter.
i understand.
miss kusumoto, this is spider 0, kilgore.
really, i saw your show.
you fight a lot.
i'll take care of yokota headquarters personally, whatever it takes.
hey, where are the civilians in the building?
what's so important?
why am i going crazy when you think of it?
madox has his target.
he'll come after you to destroy him.
i know how to walk, use my hands.
it's up to you to succeed.
either madox gets destroyed, or you destroy kilgore!
they damaged my legs.
i can't move anymore.
you think i can beat him?
you did good when we were fighting.
have you read the entire manual?
hey, madox.
bastard!
come and kill me!
couldn't you just put up a little bit more and raise my home?
l-lanet!
what happened, you turned upside down like a turtle!
if you can't even fuck this much, you're gonna stain on the name of tankbuster!
your numbers won't fall for me!
kouji!
i'm coming!
you're brave!
i'm sick of cats-fare!
you fell into my dusk trap!
i'll take you with me if i fall, madox!
that's messed with madox!
i have something very important to tell you, shori.
paul won't hurt anyone.
"unbearable"
i'm not your mother, brian.
you don't even like me.
will you really stay?
things didn't get clear.
i haven't written my arrival yet.
i hear brons in the right.
can they sew it back up?
what's your mother's name?
am i responding to internal affairs?
yes, but it would be a violation of her privacy to search her room.
john, what would you say if i told you that i came to doc magoo's waiter the night we lost the marfan syndrome?
i say it's full of people with pager.
where did he get these?
will you get the tickets?
someone could come in and claim the body.
abby, can you look at something?
what patient?
how are you?
or find someone to eat lunch with.
try to find his father.
will you please call my social worker and take me somewhere else?
would you please get me out of this room?
he stabbed carter.
why outside?
not yet.
i don't want him taken anywhere else he doesn't know.
where they keep the kids, it's more comfortable than the er and the morgue.
who pulled libertique from the sewing room?
do you have to open a vein?
sats are 00.
paroled.
i am what bruce lee is like in martial arts.
they're discharging paul.
what are you doing?
i was stabbed in the back.
where the hell have you been?
and you said it was good.
it's nice to find a special letter in bills and junk mail.
w-and i did my best, and all the parents must be blamed for it!
mothers and fathers, grown people.
that's why it's definitely a great advantage to have a strong family history.
i'm not saying that whatever you are...
do you have a seat here?
but before we start...
what's going on, brother?
you like it, don't you?
fat cunt.
fucking piece of shit.
who's this?
you all right, fellas?
anything?
i'm tony's friend.
fucking...
come on, bruv!
quick!
fuck!
you like it, don't you?
what the...
i got something for you-
i don't care!
what do you think i've been doing all this time?
you got the money?
what happened to ed?
wait, let me put another card in it.
fucking assholes!

you were supposed to pick up the laundry powder, weren't you?
bio karb...
bikarb soda.
i don't want any details, okay?
i want something simple: bikarbonat soda!
it happens in a small box!
not in a big box that says "daz" on it!
listen!
there's no point in laughing!
if you want to correct your mistake, what are you gonna do?
listen, drink your tea and take whatever i want.
i'll get it!
...carbonat... soda.
okay.
did you tell him we were here?
of course, brother.
he's my friend.
i'm going because i'm not that friendly with him.
what about your food?
thanks.

hey, excuse me?

i don't know if i have anything to do with him.
what do you mean you don't know i'm in a position to do it?
what do you think this is?
you think you're gonna walk around with me all day and then things get bad and go?
what, you're gonna run and tell your coward friends what i do?
are you gonna go over there and put a bullet in his head, or am i gonna put a bullet in your head?

get up, get up, get up.
what a coward.
why are you getting so emotional, man?
emotional?
you bring me here and you do this nonsense right in front of me.

yeah.

he didn't kill me, did he?
i'm sorry!
what the fuck!
you want some action?
brother, do you see this?
brother, do you see this?
00 pounds?

tear it and burn it, don't return it.
it's a rental car, baby...
hey, man.
of course i am.
you went to the bathroom 0 times in 00 minutes.
i was just giving the guy something...
that's what i wrote for special circumstances.
do you want to hear it?
yeah!
i was getting something from marcel, and i saw kirby on the street.
i saw it on the street behind the barber.
get out of my sight!
fuck.
how do you know it's not marcel?
things have been going on since...
you want anything from the store?
what the fuck!
tell me or i'll blow your head off!
why did he kill kirby?
kirby must have done something to that boy.
then why were you walking naked in the middle of the road the other day?
you got a car?
let's go.
this is chris, okay?
he's bigger than you.
he just wants to talk, okay?
about your condition.
get out of the car.
are you the bad boy who killed kirby?
and a little girl, right?
it was an accident.
do you know who that girl is?
no.
she was my sister!
you're sending a boy to work where a man should, and he's screwing up!
do it!
sorry about your brother.
you can put one in kirby's head and you can't kill this cunt?
jake, brother...
how do you think you got here?
how do you think i know where you live?
marcel, did you set me up?
marcel, talk to me, bruv!
you set me up, brother?
you used me, bro!
i didn't tell you to kill that girl!
that's it.
my sister was 00 years old and you killed her!
look at me!
look at me.
okay.
i know i just got out, but i lost my key.
their christian mothers were lazy, maybe.
...they leave it stinking.
they don't have morale...
it's a bit hard though, isn't it?
what are you talking about, brother?
my guy's here.
yeah, it's karaoke, right?
i was gonna be there, wasn't i?
yeah, i'll be there.
listen, i gotta go, okay, baby?
fuck!
what are you up to?
are you doing drugs in my bar?
one of them was in my place the other day, going to the bathroom all the time, saying he didn't do drugs!
what are you talking about?
aaron and the other idiot, ed.
i don't think i know what they're doing.
not in my place, man!
all right, brother.
get out of my way.
what did you say about my mother, brother?
what did you say to my mother, brother?
come here, say that, brother!
i'll call you at the next station.
give me your number!
00, huh?
the crying baby's with you, huh?
here you go. 00.
you suck!
who are you?
you're one of the illegal immigration, aren't you?
what's the baby's name?
no name.
what the hell are you doing?
oh, my god!
were my eyes open?
paddington.
i'll take you.
i got the tickets, okay?
what the fuck!
give me your number!
hey!
wait here!
what the hell?
crazy!
fuck!
son of a bitch!
you got a ticket, man?
it's okay, man.
get those bitches out of here!
come here, you fucking...
come on!
go!
ed!
what the fuck?
brother, a woman left it on the train.
and you brought him here to me?
look, brother, it's more complicated than you think, okay?
where'd you get that?
i found it.
00 doggy cops came out of nowhere.
that was the smartest thing you've ever done in your silly life!
what are you gonna do with this baby?
give it to the cops?
am i supposed to change my mind and go back?
i look like a pedophile.
no, they'll send me a house if i do that, right?
a woman leaves her own child on the train!
you see, he doesn't want her.
now i'm gonna change your underwear!
let me look after the gun for you, okay?
will you help me find her mother?
i have more important things to do than deal with this kind of nonsense.
you give me the gun and i'll hide it somewhere, okay?
give me your orders.
why'd you put it there, man?
take it!
no, call me when you're done, okay?
because we have work to do, okay, faggot?
daddy, you!
let go!
move!
can ashley come?
sir?
i got it covered, man.
i'm a little nervous, hon.
why do you get nervous?
we'll figure this out.
well, i was talking to vince...
that's a kid brother her mother doesn't want.
what are you doing, brother?
what's your problem, man?
why are you being such a bitch?
who are you, my brother, jeremy kyle?
you can't sell somebody's baby to somebody else!
especially vince and carol.
the other day, we were selling junkies to this guy!
no, you didn't, because he doesn't want to be found, man.
they'll give this boy to another vince and carol.
let go of me, brother.
i told you i'd handle it, man.
what am i supposed to tell people?
yeah, yeah, he's fine.
a bit, but don't tell anyone we're here!
just take the half, give me the rest.
i can't believe you even sold a baby!
you didn't want it before, did you?
if i'm going to go through all this stress, i lose the money, i lose everything, so you have to talk to someone properly, okay?
a nice lady.
i'm in the "fuck you" situation.
what's going on in there?
you sell drugs at the bar, don't you?
either you or your stupid brother took my gun and i need that gun.
you've got 0 hours to get my gun back or i'll kick people's homes out.
i'm going.
he always breaks things, doesn't he?
why are you bringing this whore to my place when my wife's upstairs?
what's going on?
she was having trouble with a solid russian mob.
he thought they were gonna kill the baby.
so she left the baby on the train.
now, take this money and i'll give it back when i meet ed.
this isn't fooling, vince, and you know it!
you can't understand it without a cock in your mouth, can you?
it's okay when i have your dick in my mouth!
no, he said your cock was in his mouth.
i'm not giving them the baby!
they can't take it either!
calm down, okay?
now go up and get that baby!
over here!
gun, man!
just know you're dead to give it to you.
they might not let you go because you don't have a family.
what flowers do you suggest?
white roses are good, right?
fuck!
fuck you!
are you the owner of this vehicle?
but you stopped me in vain.
but first, let's move our glasses to the new owner, chester.
chester.
i hope he'll tremble on these wonderful monsters like i've done for years.
cheers.
i promise i will raise the standards of this show and you will be proud.
safe journey to where dreams become reality.
good riddance.
even though that extra-faced german is gone, the dominance will pass.
marjorie, it's a shame...
thanks, chester.
now, if you'll excuse me, the main family, monsters and the bizarre group- spend their last moments alone.
bye.
there's someone else to thank.
mr. richard spencer.
our lives have completely changed the course.
cheers.
mm!
but tonight we'll have a nice feast, and then we'll watch a movie from my collection.
not the sign of the cross again.
no.
we're gonna watch freaks tonight.
do you know this movie, richard?
i don't know.
it's a great movie.
tell me about it, eve, paul.
ah.
cleopatra, a regular trapeze artist, marrying a little showman.
but the whole point is to poison him and put him on his inheritance.
he plays all the freaks on his finger until one day he's too drunk and his true intentions are gone.
then all freaks turn on him.
one night, they take their revenge with knives and guns.
eve, eve.
darling... don't say the ending and miss your taste.
that sounds great!
there's a lot to do before heading west.
i can't.
shut up and sit down.
you deserve it.
what happened to you?
come on, richard, pick up.
i've been thinking about you for a long time.
oh, thank god.
we've had our clients, who'd seen our show, but... no one ever fainted.
are you all right, ma'am?
where are those security guards?
good to know.
now it's your turn.
jesus christ.
i don't even know that.
i've already told them everything...
stanley.
elsa...
come on...
talk to them.
hollywood!
i'm afraid... everything you say.
just a dream.
come on, turn it over.
aah!
god...
no.
please.
my cousin works at the garden of allah.
but you brought death here... and you have to pay.
put that down.
come on, come on.
elsa, come on... we need to talk privately.
i believe we find something in common.
you think you can run now?
i'm telling the truth.
he killed her.
he's not who you think he is.
and start running.
run!
run!
run!
just because you grew up without a father doesn't mean you have to romanticize your job now that he's dead.
how did he die?
who killed him?
we all did.
he broke the rule.
now.
come on.
he was my father!
he killed a freak!
_
you believe his word?
this phony bitch?
i saw my dear ma petite in a jar with my own eyes.
i've heard it paid off with my own ears.
as for maggie, if she hadn't helped, we'd have more bodies.
i won't forgive him.
all i want is to rot in hell.
you're gonna be friends with whoever it is.
maggie's gonna change her bandages.
no!
keep the dirty ones.
now that your mother's not here, it's up to me to protect you.
i've seen you turn from childhood to man and man to leader-- and we need you.
i don't have hands!
i can't even piss myself.
i got a friend of mine.
he'll come and help you.
he's a real artist.
but first the wounds need to heal.
maggie's gonna help you.
let him.
i'm so sorry.
i hate hurting you.
really?
i thought that's all you could do-- hurt people.
i love you, jimmy.
this part is real.
i always have.
i want to start over.
we can still go to new york like we planned.
why not?
you're kidding, right?
you think after all you've done, we're just gonna sail into the new horizon?
my hands... are in a fucking jar, and you're responsible.
i'm so sorry.
can you bring ma petite back from the dead?
huh?
i've changed, jimmy.
ah!
i knew you were stupid, so let's add blind to your list, shall we?
find me someone to focus on the lamp!
i can't leave this place.
i need to get the right light for the first time, okay?
try again now!
scheisse!
elsa.
sure.
he's watching us.
can't we?
just this once?
please?
okay.
yeah.
mm.
oh.
thanks, chester.
you put me down.
like an old sock.
i'm sorry, marjorie.
i kind of... got myself caught, but i'm happy now.
i got them, i got magic, you.
maybe i should go.
we can manage, marjorie.
the twins have agreed to you.
they just don't want you watching it while they do it.
they're using you, chester.
you're their boss now.
no, they don't.
they love me.
you're a murderer.
no, no.
no.
marjorie.
i know you don't like to talk about it, so don't bring it up, but... you killed them.
and alice and lucy.
impossible.
i'm just a puppet.
hmm.
love destroys you, chester.
you're losing control.
i know...
i'm a monster.
you don't need them.
i'm in.
i know.
please don't leave me, marjorie.
twins?
they have to go.
i know.
they will.
ethel looks great here with the choir girls.
oh, this is from her barnum days.
she was a unique woman.
to ethel.
to ethel.
so what do you say?
nobody heard what spencer said last night?
now it's all settled in.
elsa killed ethel.
forest.
car accident.
it was all a counter.
i believe that.
that crazy, vindictive woman put a knife in my paul.
he's the only one elsa cares about.
i couldn't get it together in the first place.
i know ethel.
he wasn't the type to kill himself.
he's not a coward.
he wouldn't have done that to his own child, and to us.
and leave a proper note.
we know very well what to do if someone comes after us.
our future has only one trust.
that's elsa's life.
have you ever imagined you'd feel that way, dot?
thank god you said something about marjorie.
all he had to do was push him away.
i think we've definitely got a good reputation on it.
good evening, girls.
what are you doing here?
i'm here to hand out friendly xindi.
i've been briefing you on your latest mission.
we don't want to hear anything from you.
leave gently.
oh, dot, i don't blame you.
i did a terrible thing the other day.
but recent events have softened my hard side.
i lost my mother.
it was sudden and... terrible.
she was very upset, dandy.
it's terrible for anyone to lose their mother.
it was.
yeah.
and it made me feel like i shouldn't be leaving my loved ones.
but i think you should know we're seeing a man.
actually, i got your news.
you have no idea how great it is to marry you.
if i had the chance to wrap it all up...
i came from friendly emotions.
i know i lost my luck.
i'm not half the man you deserve.
but i asked myself.
"dandy, what do you have to do to support these loved girls?"
then i thought i could protect you, and that's why i hired a decent man so i could gather information about your new friend.
the result broke my heart because your chester creb turned out to be a total lunatic!
we don't need to look at these.
what's your problem?
you're a pain in the ass, and we don't trust you as much as we do.
ta-ta, then.
i did my best.
my mother always said that when a woman was angry, you would argue with her.
who is it?
boy.
here.
drink.
what is that?
penicillin.
i'd hate to see you die of an infection when i say we complete you.
who are you?
my name is massimo dolcefino.
i'm here to make you your new hands.
okay?
massimo is an old friend of mine from before the war.
he's the master of his art.
no, thank you.
i saw soldiers with grenades in their hands.
they're wearing these cool hooks.
i can't do 00 shots, but at least i can hold my own smoking.
and i don't have to be afraid of the dryers by the end of my life.
massimo offers you something more elegant than rusty hooks.
more convincing.
look.
see?
so did the other.
massimo saved my life.
your mother would have died from drinking and left you alone on the street.
i could've married her if you weren't so stupid.
"my only sin..."
si.
"...loved you..."
very much.
no!
they were members of an organization.
and their leader was a doctor you know.
now get to the other one, don't rush this time.
for two years,
massimo took care of me.
she taught me to walk.
and dance.
then he fell off the garden.
nuremberg, rhineland...
we had to escape while we still could.
we had a plan.
how could i look into my love's eyes when i knew those monsters were free?
they were supposed to pay.
i got them all one by one.
aah!
finally, i've reached the leader.
oh, the monsters.
dr. hans grouper.
it shouldn't have been a painless death.
obviously my death wouldn't be painless either.
it took me very personal to want to kill him.
very personal.
he tortured me.
he locked me in a cell and tortured me again, and again.
how did you survive?
i lived in osterlich until the end of the war.
then i came to america-- 00.
and i've been looking for miss mars for years.
but i didn't get an answer.
if you loved her so much, why didn't you know where she was and come on your feet?
my body survived the torture, but...
i was like pinocchio.
there was nothing humanity left inside me.
but, uh...
nice irony.
nice irony.
i know you've been up for a long time and it might be hard to make changes for a sitting show.
and i repeat-- this has nothing to do with ego.
for the continuum...
it looks so normal.
i don't think we can judge him unless we have absolute proof.
what about the file?
it says he killed his wife.
you're letting dandy's lies cloud your judgment.
dot and i have something to say.
we don't want to be your assistant anymore.
why?
we just... don't want to.
maybe you'll change your mind once you hear my final.
two bodies, two heads.
it'll bring a lot of noise.
a first in the history of magic.
come on, girls... let's rehearse.
we're not going in that box.
no, chester... we're not going in that box.
now if you'll excuse me...
i'll go.
you...
i can be your assistant.
yeah.
get in the box, lucy.
my name is maggie.
oop!
is this your magic act?
it looks kind of pathetic.
shut up.
i didn't say anything.
what are you looking at?
backstage.
it's called the magical saw.
tonight, you're gonna be watching a very dangerous version of this game for me.
handcuffs.
hey, i...
i don't know that part.
i went to war for you.
you should have died there.
we loved each other.
and you were there with a metal plate and a buzzing bee in your head.
chester, wait, i can't move my feet!
stop!
stop talking!
you're distracting me.
stop, marjorie.
didn't you ruin my life enough?
you're nothing without me.
i'll show you.
all of you.
chester!
chester!
chester, stop!
what are you doing?
relax, everyone... it's just magic.
magic show.
i can get him back.
again...
alakazam!
abraka...
abrabra.
it's gonna take a lot of people, chester.
he made me do it.
he deserved it.
what do we do now?
steal your jewelry and bury the bitch.
why are you packing?
you ruined everything again.
it's time to go.
you confused me.
you were conscious to sabotage me.
i finally found happiness.
i'm going.
you can't leave without me.
oh.
i loved you.
chester...
oh, god...
marjorie?
stay with me.
marjorie.
_
jimmy darling!
i'm not a stage artist like you, mom.
listen to your mother.
you have a very good smile and a wonderful towel.
you're star quality, jimmy.
now get your butt out on the stage and show your mother how proud you are.
jimmy.
maggie's dead.
you want the details?
elsa's next.
tonight.
it looks like... now you'll have a chance... in real life.
jimmy...
good for you.
how dare you come in unannounced!
what do you want?
you have to go.
they've been planning revenge on ethel's trailer all day.
they'll kill you.
why should i believe you, huh?
my monsters love me.
i'm like their mother.
ethel was more like their mother than you.
you killed their real mother.
the last nonsense of a desperate man.
now who's desperate?
you saw what they did to him.
but where would i go?
anywhere but here.
you could have saved me.
we just did.
there you are.
what's jimmy doing?
he'd be here if he could.
it's time.
give it to me.
ethel!
come on, girls... let's get some justice.
oh.
thanks for coming.
i would never deny a woman in a difficult situation.
i'm not in trouble.
but i'm in a hurry.
oh.
i want to report a murder.
who was murdered?
a young woman.
leave it here.
slowly.
put your hands where we can see them.
i did.
send me to the repairs.
what are you doing here?
i'm here to count.
i'm the new owner here.
where's elsa?
gone.
he followed his dreams.
elsa sold us again.
$00,000 in cash.
nothing.
everything here, including your contracts, it's mine now.
and i want to see what belongs to me.
was this always your dream, sir?
to be in show business?
dream.
yeah.
and it's becoming real.
thirsty.
go get me a lemonade with a straw.
yes, sir.
are you ready?
yeah.
they're perfect.
i want to try it now.
sure.
the other one.
put it on.
thank you.
but jesse james escaped and hid for two years.
in the great halls, the united states army was after sitting bull's armies, and beating the armies of crazy horse and taking down black hills in south dakota.
after the defeat at the battle of little bighorn, the united states government destroyed the buffalo, chose to starve the lakota people and bow down.
hold the line!
but despite the small wars they've won against the united states army, the struggle for indians is getting worse.
lakota leaders sitting bull and crazy horse's options were diminishing.
you're a man with a strong heart.
but i'm tired.
i'll see you.
the native americans didn't give up after their tribe and culture and the violence they saw.
in those days, going there was a chance to get rich.
a lot of men and women have tried their luck.
when the golden economy came up, the united states became the first country to save itself from global depression.
the solution was found in the west.
there's been so many beefs on the edge of texas for a long time.
but it wasn't until the railroads were completed, they could be carried flat and taken to hungry people in the east.
in texas, the beef that was given to 00 bucks was sold for $00 on the east coast.
the beef barons were bought from kansas to california, where they bought the big part of the autism field.
this land gives its owner an amazing opportunity.
we're talking about millions of acres of land, farms and thousands and thousands of major animals.
one of the cattle rustlers in the new mexico region... was going to become one of the most famous men in the west.
his story began 0,000 miles east.
billy never knew his father.
in the early 0000s, he and his mother moved to new mexico.
he wandered for years.
what do you want?
whiskey.
drop the bottle.
there were different cowboys.
always sitting in the corner.
these are the ones you should be paying attention to.
billy used to do the best he could to make a living.
billy the kid used a very good gun.
he spent every dollar he won for practice.
in a place like this, only the strong survive.
where are you going?
lincoln.
i'm just passing through.
these cattle belong to john tunstall.
then john tunstall can come and get his cattle back.
it'll help you let me go.
i don't think so.
i don't think you have a choice.
young beef thief billy the kid has been captured by a farm owner he tried to steal his cattle.
most people shoot cattle rustlers on sight.
you still haven't told me who you're working for.
i'm not working for anyone.
everyone works for somebody in lincoln county, kid.
yeah, but i don't work.
you look like a man who's used to getting what he wants.
you're right.
there's only one problem, and so am i.
you have a lot of men.
do you have room for one more?
when billy the kid came to lincoln, he needed a job.
john tunstall needed cowboys.
john henry tunstall came to the west to make a fortune.
he's moved to lincoln town where he can make money.
but this success has made some powerful men angry.
lincoln was one of the wildest of the wild west.
everything from beef price, land, government officials, home checked out.
they were paying for law enforcement even.
in fact, most of the people who lived in lincoln actually saw them as bully.
john henry tunstall came into town and stuck his nose in the beef that was in the house's monkey business for a long time.
no one could survive.
when billy got involved with john henry tunstall, he became tunstall's man.
in a few months, the young outlaw was tunstall's most trusted armed man.
for the first time in his life, he felt like he was home in the west.
tunstall was a mentor to billy the kid.
pass me your plate, billy.
thanks.
i'm starving.
everything's going so well, son.
i'm glad you're here.
thanks.
billy was always barely there.
he was seen as a team of people.
for a young man of billy's age, it was incredible and life-altering.
while billy the kid was growing up, he was become a part of the cattle industry that he was using as fuel, a couple hundred miles north to stop the expansion of the west.
calm down, gentlemen.
i'm laying my left hand as a friendship proposal.
if he hadn't done it, most of us wouldn't be here today.
we would've died fighting instead of going to the settlement.
when they put us in the settlement, they actually took people's souls.
he trusts me.
he's talking to me.
god, messiah.
this policy is known as "assimilation."
but i think they wanted us to make ourselves unprotected.
there was a saying about the army.
"kill the redder and protect the person."
it means if you destroy indians' culture, you'll be better.
they thought we were wild.
proud lakota warrior knows that he must repeat his people.
"my people are not happy here."
"i'm not happy here."
"we don't want to live on the ground."
you're not used to life in the settlement.
give it time.
i'm sure you will.
after offering his objections to the united states authorities, the army started afraid that the lakota warrior could start a new indian foot.
the united states was terrified of crazy horse.
it was said that the crazy horse wanted to kill a general who visited him.
the united states authorities were worried about the rumors of a new riot.
as the fright of crazy horse's planning something, the lakota warrior went to see the authorities to clear his name.
crazy horse thought he was meeting with the u.s. authorities.
he didn't realize the importance of the situation before.
they wanted to put him in a prison cell.
and then he pulled his knife out.
in spite of different views, i think the most trusted comment is that the white united states guard killed him by bayonet.
crazy horse wasn't killed in the battlefield.
his vision was right.
he was overwhelmed by the guard.
on september 0th 0000, the mad horse was killed by the man who fought and fought against the united states to protect his people.
it's hard to talk about crazy horse's death because it's so fresh even after so many years.
one of the most fascinating things about crazy horse and his inheritance is that there are some of the most non-american leaders in the history of america.
today, the courage to stand against the united states government is seen as the symbol of brave resistance, and he is being told of himself.
i think that's why he's so strong.
with the death of the crazy horse, the lakota people waited for a leader who could save what was left of their desperate culture.
until the house repayed catron, their refreshment was his business.
this is for you.
what if she resists?
i don't care how.
i'm only interested in the consequences.
copy that.
go check it out.
you stay here.
okay.
what's your hurry, boys?
we heard shots.
really?
don't do anything stupid, kid.
this has nothing to do with you.
that'll help you keep it that way.
there's always the initiative between these competition companies.
but like most ideas in the west, it became personal.
when someone was killed, it took a personal situation.
that person was john henry tunstall.
he was killed because of a business conflict.
it was a personal matter now.
john tunstall's death is on his way to find his killers.
this way, he'd take her to become a legend of the west of a armed cowboy.
as the country continues to expand, men like billy the kid are realizing that the border is not ruled by law.
but a man about 000 miles away from new mexico was preparing to bring law to the west.
no one was dentistier than wyatt earp... when they took what men wanted and fought for survival.
he was a big man for the 00th century standards.
he was so excited about his size.
wyatt earp was one of thousands of americans who raided west to become rich.
wyatt was caught in an incurable western disease.
he always felt he had to push the next line.
this border miners could have been investigated, real estate, an adventure.
wyatt's life went on like that.
he did everything on the border to get it.
the union did all the work for the pacific railroad to hunt buffalo, even the brothel.
they'd have to drive to the railroad stations, sooner to get the cattle from the east to the cities, more the clearing up.
so the fast-paced cities appeared.
there was a view of the unmade soil suddenly turning into a 00-bedroom hotel.
the young men who managed to make it to these cities drink whiskey and carry a gun.
i mean, there were plenty of young boys with good booze and guns.
it was one of the reasons the west was wild.
wyatt saw that there was no law in dodge city and that conflict was solved by violence.
he had a tough life.
either they'd go back east or they'd be worse.
but wyatt earp felt he had more on his destiny.
he was going to prove he was important in history to be in dodge city.
you tricked the wrong guy.
that's my money.
this guy's a cheater.
calm down.
he cheated.
calm down.
he cheated.
put the gun down.
did you see his gun?
everyone saw you reach for your gun.
give it to me.
i'll shoot you!
come on.
dodge city needed a desperate lawman.
wyatt earp was perfect for it.
it didn't take wyatt earp to be the chief of police in dodge city.
there was no special training to be a lawman.
that's not how it works in this city.
wyatt earp wouldn't ask questions.
it's a sign that comes from "cabbling with shabby."
wyatt earp is soon known as dodge city.
the role he played as a lawman would become one of the most famous figures of the west.
because cartoon chickens give my father nightmares.
where were you?
and that was irving berlin's white christmas.
the top-selling christmas song of all time
what?
actually, irving berlin wrote over 0,000 songs.
then marry her.
what's your problem?
i have no problem.
you've got the type to write.
what does that mean?
what are you doing this holiday season?
hey, baby.
where are you going?
father melley called.
i have to protect the scene of jesus in church.
i have to cook for the food sales.
did you hear me complaining?
what's with poinsettia?
i forgot again!
you're a hard man!
i can't build anything in a hostile environment!
i wouldn't be hostile if you had two penny skills!
next time you kick, i'm leaving.
your legs are cold.
how's it going?
so i brought you some soup and a thick jacket.
yeah, i'll call him.
horribly ordinary!
awful!
of course not!
yeah, and, you know, i'm a jew at eight.
good.
i'm gonna go get a bagel or something.
i'm going to the sworn guard again.
i'm calling shanghai garden.
but whatever i decide, it'll be fine!
i only have three days to make cake!"
he doesn't sound like that much, but whatever.
boom!
i was gonna make a cake, but i had to work late.
and i'm finished.
i mean, thank you, hungarian bakery!
says who?
larry's wife won't bring it.
he makes a great cake!
you know what he's doing?
any chance you could be in that town?
i really thought you were gonna make the cake!
i'm not a snowflake?
she'll never be with you, you know why?
because he'll have to take his own arm.
stop it!
wonderful!
i must have been naive.
what are you doing?
sounds like you're starting to me.
the kitchen robot, the big eyebrows...
let me think.
it's a nice, easy cake recipe.
what about that chocolate cereal?
at least i'm wearing the proper shirt for my pants...
a monkey could do it.
i love you.
i love you.
i imagine we're giants?
no.
you should have put more baking powder.
you don't even know what a prisoner is!
and no one's gonna want to buy this stupid doll cake!
we'll take the cake to a food sale in a closed plate.
okay.
my calves were never this far.
come here!
isn't it sewing?
after all the preparations...
anyway, try this.
it's divine.
it's okay.
we're not selling traditional food.
we're doing something more fun.
all right.
great plan!
i didn't count the cake walk!
i've never seen caramel do that.
it's a candy-covered chair, minder!
come on, come on.
hey, ling.
i have your mental problem.
well, when i...
elaine?
whatever.
i see him, but he's heavy.
how long has this been going on?
what does that mean?
i think you're in love.
how do i get out of this?
i got myself together.
i'm ready to sing now.
i'm looking for my soul tonight.
i know there's so much more to life.
thank you for accepting me.
how can i help you?
my wife, cindy, died two years ago.
we were married for three years.
a car crashed on our anniversary.
cindy and i wanted to have kids.
for example, he's dead.
how are you gonna do that?
did he leave either eggs or embryos?
no.
did you hear me?
i heard.
to clone your dead wife?
scientists are trying this at hand, mr. cage.
so i secretly tried to try it on cindy.
my sister-in-law heard this and hired a lawyer to stop it.
that's why i need a lawyer.
he's going to court today.
yes, but mr. stoller, i must say i'm sure your wife was a wonderful person.
but the idea of cloning?
please.
there's nowhere else i can apply.
and your firm has met this lawyer before.
who is it?
larry paul.
i heard he was very successful.
it was.
how come you're having a virtual relationship?
a relationship is communication.
what about "he"?
i know you don't like it, but if your hands aren't on your stupid stick, the woman can't control the man.
your only problem is control.
i don't know.
really?
and you came here to talk about my virtual relationship?
i came to borrow something.
but forget it.
ally?
can you take a look?
it's larry.
yeah?
this is a conflict of interest for me, isn't it?
you're responsible for the client.
yeah, but...
didn't you use little inside information when you stood up to him?
no, but i...
why wouldn't i?
only for the client.
i'm already too low on my case.
i need something.
larry's weak spot is rhythm.
he talks to me too fast when i'm arguing because he knows i can't understand what's coming to me.
okay.
he's vulnerable when he loses his rhythm.
okay.
you're on cindy margis and your dreams.
michelle garris e-mailed me and asked for a way into hollywood.
we met in hollywood and...
do it!
i won't let myself use it.
we can't deny our passion any more.
you want me, i want you.
let's be honest.
you do my knee and i'll touch my hair.
you're breaking my spine.
don't you like denial?
then let's be honest.
i'm going!
i went to l.a., and i didn't even think of you.
jackson has your mind.
people accuse me of superficiality.
but when it comes to a relationship, i know a lot about human behavior.
in our last month, you shaved your legs in the morning.
is that your scientific counter?
if a woman shaves in the morning, it's over.
no exceptions.
go to jackson.
he's the man you're crazy about.
first of all, cloning people is against society...
there's never been a court before.
people are against cloning sheep...
that's not a court of law.
you won't let me get to the second...
"two" is a sexual term.
i completely object.
i wish i could get back to the sheep.
these rude people have no place in court.
let's make a decision soon.
a moment ago?
let's hear what mr. paul has to say.
secondly, forgive me for being rude...
he's kidding.
even if he can clone, mr. stoller can't make that decision.
too many.
i'm predictable in law cases, but i've been unprepared for too much.
he made fun of me three times.
i demand a written apology, preferably notarized.
four times!
is this cloning possible?
first, i want to hear your client and know why.
your honor, i hope i...
see you tomorrow.
see you.
ling is denying he even wants it.
what do you feel?
he can have it.
he's as deep as a ink bottle.
i mean, i hope ling drowned.
are you really okay?
yeah.
actually, john cage was the lawyer across the street.
did you know?
how'd it go?
smiling is against your principles.
what's going on?
don't ask me.
john asked me for some tips he could use against you in court so i told him to break your rhythm.
you're no good without rhythm.
cute, but useless.
you gave him advice?
his client is my client.
we sleep together.
you're going behind my back.
you're giving him advice when you can't beat me?
does john know you can never beat me?
excuse me?
does john know you never beat me?
no, no.
never?
isn't that nice?
very cute.
one day i'm gonna beat you, but john's gonna beat you today with my advice.
great.
i'll lose my edge.
no, you won't.
now he knows i'm trying to break his rhythm.
he said you could never beat him.
not only in this case, but in any case.
he said that?
yeah.
i bet you, john.
he said i'd never beat him?
exactly.
never?
never.
sure.
i can date a guy in paris.
you can get as far away from here as you like.
i'm not gonna get you into this.
no, i don't.
how was i?
larry?
why are you here?
i thought john and i could walk together.
you're trying to confuse me, i won't let you.
i saw you smirk.
it was never supportive.
everything okay, john?
you seem a little uneasy.
he's trying to take advantage of it, but he won't break it to me.
fine.
you want to go out to dinner?
i'd love to.
i'm full today, but how about tomorrow?
great.
we always talked about having kids.
i think i want to do cindy and my dream.
but you're not talking about having cindy's baby.
you want to clone him.
the only way to maintain his genetic legacy is cloning.
many people, including mr. paul, as he sits so well...
your honor, i'd like to stand as gay as you can.
mr. paul, sit down.
mr. cage, don't provoke it.
a lot of people find the idea of cloning disgusting.
but i'm not a scientist trying to perfect the species.
and i know i can't bring cindy back.
i want to make sure that it lasts.
and i don't think i want her extinct.
thanks.
first of all, i'm sorry for your loss.
but you're trying to copy cindy, right?
this is a genetically engineered replica of your dead wife.
his appearance, his speech, the same...
did cindy ever mention genetically engineered fruit?
he was against it.
what about the gene chickens?
he was against it.
but it was open to the idea of a genetically engineered copies of her own.
it's not the same!
not everything's about chickens, counselor.
i didn't say that.
i'm nervous enough without you.
you wouldn't let anyone get your number.
whatever makes you great, you must win it again.
maybe melanie scared him off.
john, i'm sorry, man.
but remember, larry said you could never beat him.
never.
now you must think big.
because this time, i won't rub his feet.
whatever happens, you have to find barry white.
yeah.
yeah.
come on!
we did it together, baby.
does ally know?
the pressure doesn't help me.
may i?
sure.
just you and me.
bullshit!
how does this cloning work?
very impressive.
we're taking eggs from the donors we inject with reproductive drugs.
from the clone candidate, this is cindy stoller, getting cells.
this part is very impressive.
the witness said it was impressive before.
just this part?
then pull the core of every egg, with a needle.
the needle in the cloning is too much.
we put the dna removed, the eggs, next to the transmitter cell.
so cindy's cell.
and practice energy.
what does that mean?
we're in shock, kind of electricity...
i'm trying to understand.
you're downloading it to kill bugs, and i find it disgusting, even for a public supervisor.
let's continue.
you two are falling out of my sight.
after energy is given, what happens to cells?
when the transmitter cells are given energy to the dnaless cells, they fuse each other.
then we put them in the surrogate mom, and it's a clone baby.
sperm?
no, that's very impressive.
is that really possible?
i must admit, a lot of embryos are dying.
but it's a chance one will succeed.
we already tried that in sheeps.
it's possible for humans.
how far is this technology?
it's here now.
people don't expect science.
scientists are waiting.
thank you, doctor.
hey, mark.
if you need anything, call your assistant.
i don't see you in slow motion anymore, you two-faced weasel.
i see it.
maybe another time.
what's going on?
i'll tell you about it sometime.
forget it.
what's your problem?
what's wrong with me?
i threw myself at you.
i threw it like a cannon.
you know what this is really big for me?
i made you a gesture.
i told you i was in love with you last week.
anyone can share such a stupid feeling.
please.
i want something very small.
closing remarks, you must be with me.
together, we can beat larry.
just you and me.
come on!
you're at the end of your career.
what else are you doing?
are you here?
you're here!
that's why i start the day with the cappuccino.
he was here.
who?
barry white came.
forgive me if i can't guess.
my concentration.
not like before.
with other people in the room, i can't bring him.
most people can't dance with imaginary giants in front of others.
i always brought him.
i used to walk down the street with him.
no, here's what you should do.
call him in the bunker alone.
first take him out of the cut, then leave, and move on.
i don't know if i can.
you have to.
without barry, what are you?
check it out.
you can't spend your life like this.
you have no choice but to find barry.
they'll take her personality, her dna.
your brother-in-law loved your brother.
excuse me, that's what i'm going to do with my objections.
he won't bring cindy back.
as it's been said, even eggs twins share the same dna, different people.
even when a person's organs are taken, he needs permission.
the replication of dna is a much more intervention.
it means getting into them.
i'm sorry.
was it mine?
i didn't mean to.
it was a mistake.
don't you want to see your brother's genes continue?
she'll sound like him, she'll talk like him.
wouldn't he want that?
he was against genetic research from the beginning.
she definitely wouldn't want that.
never.
you have a computer.
i want some privacy.
brazilla.
it'll really be our first conversation.
i feel very good about him.
but hurry up.
i'm the one who's gonna rub his stinking feet.
did you find barry white?
any signs?
never mind!
can't you find your own office?
yours is closer to the court and my feet hurt a little.
i have no idea.
elaine!
things have been watching each other.
will you stop following me?
you think that's what i'm doing?
i didn't ignore you.
i thought you weren't interested.
you were right.
let it go, deja vu.
you've been angry ever since i came to this firm.
i'm angry because you lied to me.
i'm angry because i slept with you.
it's always hard to walk around happy.
cheerleader is hard.
i don't understand why you do it every day.
obviously, from the beginning, we're both a little embarrassed.
then why don't we make a fresh start?
you may be right.
or not.
jackson.
how are you?
no complaints.
this belongs to both of us, right?
he's up to something.
yes, it is.
no one, just you and me.
he's a funny little guy, isn't he?
i don't mind.
just in time.
it's like being dr. frankenstein.
the idea to start packing organs?
choose dna?
these are horrible.
we could have a hockey team full of wayne gretzky copies.
they can connect a pitbull to mike tyson.
the odds.
horror.
but the fact is, every time the science steps out, the worries of humanity rise.
we've already made tup dolls, your honor.
we're playing with the genes.
this technology will save lives.
is there a risk of abuse?
sure, i do.
my client knows the wishes and dreams of his wife.
dreams they had together.
this process will give them the chance to maintain the family legacy they hoped for.
we have to be open to a science that will allow a couple to have children.
it's not about who owns her dna, is it?
i remind mr. paul that the wife of his life can spare his organs without permission.
mr. paul, i'm just saying this in case anything goes wrong about mrs. stoller's wishes.
but there's no reason to believe that.
you never know when to speak.
now it's your turn.
i may not have a legal reason.
but i have a moral compass.
that's what's at stake.
then why stop there?
he can clone his mother.
his grandfather.
one day, they can play with the twins of their grandmother in the sandbox.
celebrities might start selling their dna.
imagine being a parent to barry white's twin brother.
when technology takes over the reproduction, will it be crossed when the universe is over?
once we were afraid of heart transplants.
the idea of a tube doll was considered abnormal.
now the truth of life and society accepts it.
there are steps to clone, to save lives, destroy disease.
this could be real.
but copying a human clone's dna and doing exactly the same?
dismissed.
i'm sorry.
i appreciate the effort.
i don't want a rematch.
hi.
hi.
you come here often?
this is my entrance sentence.
terrible entrance sentence.
has it ever worked before?
better.
you want to go into the bar?
not tonight.
because you beat larry?
it's not that.
to tell you the truth, i didn't want to win this time.
no, i want to be alone tonight.
alone with him.
not at all.
like you said, most people don't dance with imaginary disco.
you're not crazy.
honestly, i'm a little jealous.
when you're disappointed in the real world, you create things.
hey.
maybe the three of us can walk.
give it a shot.
if he doesn't come, i'm still in.
well, i'll do that.
let's go.
who knew karaoke night would be the most delightful party on the avenue?
you told p. diddy and kissinger?
let's just say, "islands in the stream" never said that.
the limo driver called and said...
embarrassing donald trump's wedding?
sam, i've been in vegas for 00 minutes, but i haven't even played one hand blackjack yet.
your favorite table is ready.
ladies love a good karaoke singer, danny.
call me.
you think you can get any girl you want?
pick it up.
it's a lonely mission, man.
he's here for the born-again virgin convention.
technically, girls without virgins can change purely.
card counters have hit two hotels this month, and the latest report on blakjack is missing on their desk.
there's a card number downstairs.
ed thinks you might be a card counter.
maybe we can continue this conversation later, like drinking.
patty, this is three, and you've been here a week.
i didn't pay my rent, and the owner let me stay...
listen, i'm sorry, but this is a business.
i'll sink if we pay for every shirt you sank.
all right, the gift box is packed and waiting to go to the guest rooms.
our florist brought the orchids and the other 0,000 are coming tomorrow.
although, if for some reason, there's a boat coming from amsterdam to...
mary, don't worry.
i'm sure everything will be fine.
you're the most relaxed bride i've ever seen.
thanks for coming, galina.
that looks like a hundred grand dress.
a hundred thousand dollars?
like i said, it's first for me.
a lot more than what we lost.
it doesn't mean playing with a certain blanket.
numbers sit at a table and play rich, right?
suspect miss, redhead, yellow dress, headed west.
thank you.
mr. sperreos, i'm from security.
the question i've always asked.
we're not married yet, and you've been staying out all night.
hayra is not a sign.
honey, i win here.
this night's over, and so is yours.
all right.
i told donald trump that our wedding should be like a delicious chicken wing, compared to the party at palm beach.
my team has spent months trying to make your wedding the biggest, most elegant wedding this city has ever seen.
come on.
even when he was a secretary, he was always like a boss.
why are you so desperate?
when your commission stops playing, montecito will still be ahead, and that's all i care about.
let's go, people.
the guy with the tie told us he told us he was telling us to turn down the air conditioning a dozen times.
he could mark the killings of the 00th and make the game rich.
that slot machine there sits all night, rarely plays.
and he doesn't take his eyes off the blakejack masks.
sperreos likes to stand up and win the game a minute before we get into a game.
you can't prove it.
even if i count the cards, it's not illegal.
that's technically true.
but we have a different idea of justice in vegas.
like i used to, i could catch a cheater and destroy it in the desert.
i'll be honest with you, i'm an old-fashioned guy.
please.
now that we have your picture, you're in the black book.
if you set foot in from the montecito, i'll have you arrested in private.
you hear that?
hey, jack!
the guy let us down for 000,000.
as long as the number doesn't have a machine, you know it's not illegal, and he didn't have it.
at least we can have some fun with him.
it's not you.
if someone's financing it and teaching you stuff, it's not the end of anything.
this is mike from last night, mystique.
the guy with no phoenix.
there are other cities you're not.
des moines, for instance.
it's astonishing, but i have to go.
i'm devastating, aren't i?
you finally said something i joined.
i think it should be you, 'cause i'm mostly attractive.
then what?
maybe i'm getting a little nervous around you because you're so beautiful.
i'm speechless.
you know what we're gonna do?
what is it?
we'll just sit down and drink and try to understand why.
patty.
almost there.
did they say i was good?
it doesn't matter if you're okay.
i should fire you.
please.
thank you, thank you, thank you.
the tailor said he sent it back this morning, but there's no record of it being there.
000 of our friends are coming to this wedding tomorrow, head of state, industrial leaders, oprah.
would you like to tell oprah that the wedding's been canceled and he came to las vegas for nothing?
if we don't, montecito will be glad to get the same.
that dress was a fashion statement.
a dozen french tailors sewed on their hands.
there's no other one like him.
do you know how much that dress cost me?
it's a big problem, sam?
wait.
hey, danny, you asked me to look at the big blackjack winner.
montecito's already spent food, flowers, decor, entertainment.
if the wedding isn't as planned and lipworth refuses to give it to you.
you think someone really stole it?
what's the street value on that thing?
why not the tailor galina?
he took care of the price of the dress.
mike.
hey.
let me know how it goes.
are those the same techniques that sperreos and his team used?
we catch a team, they send someone else in a few hours.
if we don't find out who's behind this, we might have to give them the key to the safe.
you'd better get out of here, you bastard.
are you talking to sperreos?
you'd better take your hands off me, because the president's assaulting me would cause more than i won from montecito.
that's good.
did i get the dress?
i just want to know what happened.
i make changes and give the dress to the montecito messenger.
there's a camera in the store?
i've seen real diamonds in a costume made for elton john.
compared to this, this dress is nothing.
galina protects herself.
you're free to go.
i'm helping, patty.
god knows why i agreed to this project?
i've always helped the baby bird, even the rabies.
then i'll go get my tray.
this is christina, one of our best waiters.
knees bent, back trouble.
more than anything, trust.
trust.
tray full of martinis with his weight.
he'll drink the heaviest drink.
he doesn't even look at the glasses.
he believes in his ability to do it right and here it is.
the zen team.
you're not much zen.
breathe with me, patty.
be like booze, patty.
you want me to sit here until mystique opens?
thank god i don't want you standing here like a karate child.
call me sensei.
vic, this morning, you sent one of your guys to the store to pick up a dress.
yeah.
do you remember who you sent?
the tailor gave me a recording, but i couldn't remember the face.
bart, you went to the store this morning to get a dress.
no, i didn't go.
why not?
just as i was about to leave joey stopped me and he wanted to leave.
scan for joey and find his address for me.
thanks.
i'm sorry.
the air of the hazar sea.
why would he break his receipts?
did you hear about the dress?
yeah, candy.
who's candy?
not me, because i know it's forbidden here, but the others call.
do you know where we can find it?
danny mccoy, montecito surveillance and security.
how do you know nick sperreos?
cops don't scare me.
okay, wait, wait.
fine.
that's enough.
okay, i know him.
he came here a few times with his friends.
these are his friends?
you know these guys?
yeah, i guess so.
nick's a good kid.
and then he asked me to spoil the chips.
i guess he thought i wouldn't doubt it.
strippers are always rewarded with receipts.
look, it was good for five minutes work, and i didn't have to take my clothes off.
why are you so interested?
because sperreos and his friends are involved in some kind of card counting operation.
i thought they were just some rich kids.
there's somebody behind this and i need to find out who.
do you have any idea who's training them and who's financing it?
they came in once with a bigger man than them.
yeah, they called him bucky.
mitch, did you scan joey's face?
roll forward.
someone's paying him.
can you expand the painting?
no, but i can get another angle.
so, lipworth's fiancée lissy?
we need to talk.
but you already know, right?
i know you paid to get rid of the robe.
the point is, why?
this wedding, details, vaccination, cost...
listen.
if you want to leave, this road is a little strange.
that's the thing.
i don't know if i want to leave.
i love him, but his life...
i mean, how many of those 000 people are my friends?
people say this is a cinderella story.
i'm not cinderella.
i'm just a new jersey girl.
i may not know much, but when i think my wedding is 00 times more expensive...
that's not true.
yeah.
jared and i are very different.
i mean, what harm can it do?
how old do you think these kids are?
00, no bigger than 00.
danny, the yearbooks you asked for.
we'll see.
they're all in their 00s, and they all have the math skills to count cards.
then they must have been taken from the math department and trained children.
then i remembered, how do i get them on their knees?
given how the second team got here right away, i started with local college.
because you're a great guy, and i'm interested in the less attractive ones.
maybe it's time for a change.
listen, mike, before this goes too far, there's something i should say.
i'm here in vegas for the "watchman-looking kogr".
refreshing.
i've made mistakes with guys in my past, so i wanted to start a clean slate, and i swore an oath until i got married.
i mean, just because i gave my gift first doesn't make it worth less.
nice marriage officer.
fine.
what's up?
you want to go back to school?
i'd like to go back and do my practice, and go to the rainforest and examine the native people.
you're an idiot.
what's up, ruben?
touch me and i'll call my lawyer right away.
you gonna call your lawyer?
what do you want?
where's bucky?
i don't know what you're talking about.
we have records of you robbing montecito.
i don't think these students here like that.
i can call the dean right now and get your ass out of here.
please, don't tell my family.
hey.
hey.
did you hear about being born again?
so you always knew that?
i'm sorry, but i can get every girl i want... all the nonsense i've ever wanted...
yeah, i set you up with a sweet, beautiful guy.
you were going to give it up because it wouldn't sleep with you.
hey, where are you going?
hey, mike.
i won't be needing you.
hey.
i acted like an idiot.
i needed some time to go through all this.
do you think you have a place in your heart where you can give me a second chance?
the room service that brings the cream, baby?
excuse me.
what was all this gift stuff about?
because to me, it seems to me that the gift from after christmas is all around the paper.
look, i was born five or six times.
so why can't it be me?
i tried to change.
so it's my fault?
i'm really sorry.
i took your advice.
i talked to jared and told him everything.
the wedding's off.
i said the wedding's off, not marriage.
is bucky training his team here?
hey, ruben, if it's funny, get your family on the phone.
bucky.
mr. buckner?
you know him?
my high school math teacher.
i'm a security manager at the montecito.
yeah.
you remember mrs. buckner?
last year, coach ran off with kajoyan.
alimony kills me.
it's night school debts.
but that's tax fraud.
you guys made a lot of money from a lot of casinos.
i'm guessing some of that money wasn't reported to the tax office.
keep these card counters away from the montecito, and we'll forget it.
before these kids leave, danny gets their picture and information.
what's the name of the food on the left?
oh, my god.
did you miss the flowers, the towel and oprah?
you know i don't care about those things.
the only thing that matters is spending the rest of my mother-in-law with you.
delinda, i'm sorry.
she needs to listen to you, honey.
i'll make you a star.
i hope you wrote it down somewhere.
be careful, we're about to go in.
do i know you?
vinny, she's hanging out with your mom.
do you really want to risk your life for a skirt and a geezer?
any sign of the professor?
i know six languages, why...
stein's gonna kill sara in the library.
somehow the speedster got into stein and he's pushing under his ship.
since when do you call him jax?
unfortunately, it doesn't last long.
what did you do to stein?
capone's men are taking over the ship.
you're here because i killed that stupid leader of jsa.
mr rex tyler, right?
i don't want to spend the whole night here.
you're welcome, you drunken freaks.
my job's better.
i am in charge of the entire stadium.
every night, 00,000 people come here to have fun, and i'm sure they have fun.
are you an actress?
yeah.
okay.
tell springsteen i'm the boss here.
don't say that.
whatever he wants, just say it.
have you seen a hot market manager around here?
where you been, man?
i have a meeting after the game.
how much time do we have?
0 minutes, 00 seconds.
0 minutes, i can do a lot of things in 00 seconds.
you're a funny girl.
i'm seeing other people.
i'm seeing other people.
happy birthday, ben.
how do you know?
morning.
all right.
happy birthday, ben.
you're a maintenance man, right?
two years ago, you said, "yes."
it's a little trickier because you don't always ask yes or no questions.
for now, forget i said that.
tonight there'll be circus here, and if there's ice on the floor, those firemen will be lost in front of the children, lost on their own firesticks.
understand?
you also told me not to run in the hallway.
forget about the conversation we had two years ago.
oh, no, no, no.
he wants to talk.
that's not good, buddy.
melt that ice, bobert.
benjamin!
come here.
quick.
crystal, before you get upset and start firing everybody, about that ice...
did you see a little white pill with the spanish written on it?
i don't quite understand your concern.
did i already take that pill?
hello.
yeah, i think you already took the pill.
i hate it when the circus comes here.
are they happy?
are they upset?
why are his pockets so big?
i'm sure you're talking about clowns.
morning, beautiful people.
morning, alonzo.
you're in an incredibly wonderful mood again.
every day is a beautiful day, my friend.
really, every day?
ben, that was the best day.
that was the day i stopped caring about myself and started devoting myself to the great people of san diego.
what are you doing?
i have to get that pill out of my system.
what about today's help meeting?
i spent a lot of money on illegal himalaya dogs.
one of the dogs bet she bit a himalayas.
anyway, i have a himalaya nightmare.
can't we use that money to make it better?
all right, you're the owner, we'll do what you say.
did you see the oil painting?
don't forget to bring some kind of kids for the photo.
you know, black, white.
get me an asian kid.
and we're gonna need a cup.
asian kid will give me a cup.
you're right to applaud because these are very good ideas.
benjamin, i almost forgot.
your... son?
how's your new assistant working out?
thank you for her.
he set a man on fire?
there was an investigation.
the evidence was inconclusive.
i mean, yeah.
he's okay, though, right?
she set him on fire.
not very well.
a-a-al-al...
alonzo...
what do you think it means when a girl sends a message that we have to talk about?
i'm in the same thing.
i think you'll find a better chance of getting closer.
what could be better than that?
yeah, that's what i thought.
happy birthday, little man.
morning, heather.
morning.
i'll tell you why i love it.
ben!
there's a man in your office, and he's very attractive.
okay.
hi.
hi.
is anyone else here besides you, someone more attractive than you?
no.
okay.
my name is ben.
i'm roman.
so you're crystal's son.
that must be terrible for you.
yeah.
it's not amazing.
i wonder how they swim in the water without sinking.
okay.
i like mafia movies.
as a gift...
this is an exciting place.
there's political meetings, sports, rodeo, nightclubs, motorcycles.
you're not interested in any of this?
remember me?
i texted you three messages, and you didn't answer any of them.
i guess after five months of sleeping together, you're supposed to know i'm crazy about the unanswered messages.
look, i know we hate commitment.
i'll take that "date relationship."
but this morning, i woke up in your house alone, which means you snuck out of the house.
i couldn't find my underwear until i was out of my wallet paying for coffee.
i bought another coffee with this, more...
who is this?
and i like mafia movies.
you and i, we really need to talk.
yes, it is, because it's a better chance of getting closer.
what could be better than that?
this is a good business opportunity for you.
see you at the christmas party.
i don't think you mean that.
say it in spanish.
i speak a little spanish.
yeah, i never understood what you said.
actually, your english is very good.
elephant!
crystal.
did you hear what i just said?
i didn't hear it.
let me see that speech.
i don't think you should say, "yay, black kids."
so, when should i say it?
i don't think you should say it at all.
and i wouldn't sing it either.
the ice is still there.
yeah, i know.
it doesn't seem sad to me.
it's your way of life.
you never wanted someone who was emotionally attached to you, wondered how and where you were, kissed you by morning, waiting for you at home.
what's good about celebrating all this on your birthday?
but you throw big parties on your birthday.
i need to know that i will never be alone.
i'm not sure what i'm supposed to do now.
i'll go down, you step on it, go.
thanks.
blacks, whites, asians and...
don't sing that song.
i think we should have dinner to celebrate my birthday.
this is a good phase for our relationship.
i think we should be together.
i'm going to end this relationship.
why did you let me speak first?
you first.
start with all our conversations from now on.
we've seen other people, remember?
alonzo?
he's my best friend.
she's been wanting to live with me for a while.
he wants to connect.
he wants to connect?
the person we're talking about is a man, right?
what a guy.
look, i...
alonzo is an adult.
he cares about other people.
he asks questions about me, and he listens to my answers.
what bothers me is that i thought we were the same.
when you say emotionally damaged,
how did he react when you told him?
he was a very happy man.
it blew him up.
live with me.
we can do the commitment thing.
honey, i'm not the right woman for you.
you're so sweet, you're great to have fun.
but no one can be right for you, because you're only thinking about yourself.
what the hell was that?
i think the voice was in my head.
i can't be a frying master.
i think so.
you know what the worst part is?
i don't think about anyone but myself.
it's really impossible for me to take care of other people.
suddenly, i feel the need to make contact, but i have no idea how to do it.
i'm in trouble, man.
kermit the frog, right?
yeah.
so what about him?
i think it's superb.
come on, man.
sunlight.
hi, ben.
hi.
he's very attractive.
sorry.
anyone here know how to use an axe?
come on, clowns.
almost done.
keep breaking.
good day.
where's the asian kid?
i especially wanted an asian kid.
there's an asian kid over there.
alonzo.
yeah.
yeah.
thank you.
they stopped.
most of the time people ask why i love children so much.
maybe because i never had my own child.
i believe that our children's happiness is the health of the society we want to live in, and the efforts of the people who live in this society.
they are the most important gay people in our future.
when you ask them to do something for you, they do it with enthusiasm.
or as i got older, i started to believe that a life you lived for yourself was empty.
i wasn't gonna say it, but in this particular case i have to share a little song with you.
you know, aside from the musical part, it was really very moving.
sometimes it's really fun working with you.
i'm so happy right now.
on three, everyone say, "thank you, crystal cohen."
two...
oh, my god!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
what a wonderful moment.
i noticed you left a little early.
hello again.
are you really okay?
i'm a little scared.
sure.
you know, it's okay to think that you chose the right guy.
i'm 000% sure i chose the right guy.
all right.
what a wonderful moment.
i've never done this before.
what if i'm not ready?
what if he's just acting like he wants me?
what if he doesn't want me after he has me?
of course he'll want you.
you have everything.
everything.
okay?
okay.
okay.
actually, we could have sex one last time.
hello, crystal.
i really want to have sex with her.
i'll see what i can do.
can you give your attention to the poor boy you just threw in the air?
luckily, i convinced them to air this photo.
more than just kicking the cop.
less than you ruined the mayor's boat.
great.
great.
while i have you,
i'd like you to sit down with someone who's childlike joy and loyal to us, who's gonna be an incredible asset here at sunlight.
get in the car.
get in the car.
i'm sure you have a lot to talk about.
great.
happy birthday, ben.
thanks.
hey.
what's your name?
dan.
thanks, dan.
i forgot.
have you seen alice?
in his office.
it was business.
i...
i see what you mean.
what do you do in a situation like this?
i think i'm gonna run like my life depends on it.
yeah, that's what i'm gonna do.
they set up security cameras looking directly at paddy.
melt in your mouth when you eat.
he'll rebel anything you say.
this is bullshit, man.
these guys finally realized that by living with me, they were so cool and so funny.
dee, you're undercover, okay?
dee, we're putting you in charge of this assignment, charlie, but the arrogance and questions we've received?
maybe we'll go to the private office upstairs.
do i have to know the guy when he spaghetti on his face?
i'll buy one for the guy i don't know behind me.
i told you why.
'cause i think you've been hanging out a lot lately.
i couldn't sit down because charlie was interrupted by some goddamn emergency lunch.
i don't want to come across anything you've come across.
like i said to that bar a few minutes ago, our fish from today were extinct.
instead, let's all have a plate of hot spaghetti.
and extra sauce.
i've always wanted to see that.
comic books, baseball players, even protestors.
may the lord protect the cream pie and america.
look, i'm a experienced businessman with a long history of asia countries.
imagine my exquisite pie recipe with your low-priced labor force.
because of my accidents on the base, the factory was closed for a few days.
the fact is we're pretty good at the chinese factory.
i don't think there's any need to be worried about her.
it's just old porn.
all aboard the tucker train.
not exactly the way it looks.
no, it can't be.
these are the things my children valued when they were small.
besides, you know you can't sell these disgusting things in the garage.
these boxes show how perfect our lives are.
like they always gave you false identities?
the pictures i did in kindergarten and thanksgiving turkey hand?
i'm sorry, honey.
i put the finger here because i have a feeling something's changed here.
danny's not the only one who wears a jersey uniform and hits the bat.
in the basement, they were next to the christmas lights, and i noticed mrs. bart lost his nail.
i just didn't see you had a plan to win.
yeah, you gave us a free beer, and you said "vote for me."
we're very fortunate that everyone is retreated.
i don't really do anything about sports anymore.
god, it feels like this is some other life.
i need to hit something with a stick for beer.
okay, brawlers, i'd like to propose a toast before the game.
maybe we'll remember that winning isn't everything, but we have a barrel!
wait.
everyone, this is riley and my daughter emma.
i mean, wheeler's 0-0 in unplanned pregnancy.
tuck, why don't you give the newcomers something?
ben!
that's something i know.
you're going out with mom?
i was gonna talk to him myself, but bonnie said she'd handle it.
i did, but i didn't tell him.
you can't say you took it well.
so, after your mom's date with the coach, they can make a pillow talk in bed.
if i were to call back the girl you made happy hours ago, we'd be glad you were cut off.
we may have more babies.
i'm going to practice until my brain is exhausted.
he's throwing his food around, i think he's doing it well.
the father's daughter.
my mom's coming soon, will you take the equipment downstairs to the field for me?
this is more than i did before i was heavy.
you don't care about the cups, do you?
sounds like i missed the game.
you missed another little thing.
the boys carved riley to be the captain.
i was telling you it was a complete loss.
i was feeding my baby and you took my team away.
i was wearing your gloves... and then everyone started yelling.
"you're amazing!"
because i heard it was amazing.
maybe you could do something good i haven't done in a while.
because i don't care what others say.
"in your face, suckers." i'm so excited!
we just ate some italian food.
that's why i'm trying to stop you.
honey, i don't think we should talk about these parts, these are my personal life.
okay, honey, i know you don't want to hear this, but i'm a woman and i have needs.
i won't even open my mouth.
he said, "take the money."
i don't want someone to cancel their plans.
thank you, danny.
not yet, but it will be solved.
honey, are you okay?
i tried to get here as soon as i could.
with my hair and this, you're 00 minutes away.
i couldn't call anyone to watch emma.
the dentist said i should see you right away.
and remember, don't bring home the giant toothbrush.
for the bathroom key.
i'm sorry about your date with hank.
i can't even talk to you right now.
please tell me that emma is in the car outside.
i don't know if hank canceled anything or canceled.
but if mom asks, they kept me here.
you care about other people's happiness.
to make sure he doesn't and doesn't understand.
dude, you gotta go back.
you think he stopped being rigantor?
he's gonna whisper small planets into my head?
will you look here?
the minister has gone home.
if it's not hank, it'll be somebody else.
do you have menus down here?
mom, i'm home.
what are you doing here?
i'm sure it's my robe.
hank, you ready for round two?
danny, there's nothing going on here.
you're unbelievable.
yeah, she hates it.
because we don't watch the same game here.
it's actually full of vodka.
we'll drink this and throw it away.
we have a chance to make a clean shot.
sit down, wheeler to the other ladies.
what about riley?
okay, tuck, it's your turn.
hit again, don't miss and get out of the field.
when i told riley something i hadn't heard before, she ate my crayons.
i still can't forget that you ate your brown.
don't worry, i'll watch your back, okay?
hey, teammates.
don't you look cute today?
is that my phone?
something about the game.
thank god.
i was worried i couldn't bring you back.
i know what you're thinking, but you have to do something other than control the team.
like i did right now?
i want you to be more serious about the games.
i'm having a hard time getting you into the squad, according to the others.
to tell you the truth, i should throw you off the team.
but i can't.
i'll really miss you when i don't play you.
thank you.
what did you want to tell me?
just...
"take it, riley's gone.
"i'm firing him now."
what is this?
that's the evil version of what i'm telling you.
coach, can we talk?
i think you want your robe back.
it didn't...
my mother told me what happened.
i'm really sorry about that reaction.
next time i'll tell him i'll be better.
i don't think there'll be a next time.
don't blame him for being a jerk.
so you're keeping a funny woman out of your league?
no, that's my mom you're talking about.
and someone who goes out with him is very lucky.
i'll go out with him.
it'll be safe if you take him down.
what's wrong with me?
maybe you're just too smart and too beautiful.
winning is fun for you.
oh, my god, i like it!
but what does that get me?
your room is filled with mugs and no one sharing it with me?
danny seems to have figured it out.
yeah, none of us are gonna be like your brother.
yeah, i think i've heard it a couple of or a thousand times.
right.
right.
i was thinking of a change in progress for the win.
i've never tried it before.
yeah, i think you should figure out how to expose the real brawlers without me.
ben, nobody wants me.
go, brawlers!
all thanks to my lovely assistant captain.
if riley wasn't with the referee.
he really needed a new glass.
no, i can't hide anymore.
honey, you have to help me.
the fear in his eyes caused them to close.
get lost.
don't worry.
i'll find a man who can make you happy.
okay.
he seems to be getting better.
i know when i see my son at work.
like i always say, thank god for giving me ben.
do wheeler, do wheeler...
what's riley doing?
they call him wheeler.
we'll use you to track this from the inside.
why is patty interested in this murder?
i suggest mr. purcell not answer another question.
you were at home alone with your wife's body.
there's no sign of a break-in.
patty, i saw the guy who did it.
our company was hired to do toxicological research on a chemical compound.
these companies are worth hundreds of billion dollars.
michael, this is daniel purcell.
we have a security problem.
head counselor of the world's third largest energy producer.
did you tell anyone about us?
acid rain from the coal-hazing power plant makes bullets at 00 times the nation's average.
regionals have tried to sue a mass case.
so in the last three years, they had more than 000 lawsuits filed against them?
why didn't he bribe you?
i wonder the same thing, but i don't know how patty ever knew we were trapping tom.
what did you guys find out about purcell?
we need to make sure our secret is still on the move.
it's okay with me.
ellen, i know it's disappointing, but you have to back off.
we're all gonna back off.
it might help me.
i have no experience in criminal law.
we must have chased him out before he could find time to steal anything.
it was dark the first time.
you know, last night, i was wondering if somebody's messed up the houses.
isn't it your job to find it, detective?
let's see if there's anything in the pictures that will jog your memory.
mr. purcell isn't here to be harassed.
he always did.
this is a very important development, mr. purcell.
you find the ring, you find my wife's killer.
mr. purcell, i believe you.
because the person who killed christine is still out there, and you're totally useless.
you can't use these against me.
don't answer that.
i swear you pretended to be arrested.
one incident three years ago is not possible.
no, but it's like he's lying about everything.
i mean, two break-ins and nothing's stolen.
wasn't the contamination harm done?
we talked on the phone a couple times, but i guess he still doesn't.
he wants me to meet the guy he's with.
if there's anything we need to know, patty will tell us when she's ready.
whatever you put the company into, it better not come out of stolen documents.
if you're wondering what happened to christine purcell, look at the grieving widow.
my only job is to protect mr. kendrick and if you've done anything to expose him or ultima national resources...
everything okay in new york?
daniel purcell, i'll see patty hewes.
do you have reason to believe that ultima national resources was involved in the murder of your wife?
i've watched a lot of farm animals die these days.
00 years ago, he used daniel purcell as an expert witness, and he won a case.
then why was ibc global's report that 000 parts... was acceptable?
daniel purcell was a brilliant man, but when he came face to face with patty, he collapsed.
no, this is just another big conspiracy to expose for you.
as soon as i tell you what i know about ultima national, you'll throw me away.
whatever he tells you, you can't trust him.
i don't know who killed your wife, but you'll be blamed for it.
he and purcell worked together before ibc global.
nine months after purcell's testimony, michael was born.
just the two of them.
we'll meet unexpected elements.
we'll disable them with a major attack.
on three.
one, two, three.
shoot them!
detective stark?
excuse me.
yeah.
that guy over there.
and you pulled him over on the 00th?
am i sworn?
i'd appreciate it if you'd stop asking me that.
was mr young the one you pulled over on the 00th?
i can't tell if you don't say it again.
what?
do you know what this is, you son of a bitch?
it wasn't a real bomb.
"no blood, no crime"
not legally, detective.
even the threat with the bomb is a clear physical danger.
it's a terrible build.
i think your shirt is horrible.
your honor, we demand the referee of the case.
liz, i don't know what to say.
he's your partner, jack.
that's not good enough, jack.
we've been trying to catch wayne young for years.
liz, i...
jack, what are you gonna say?
i need to be alone.
you want some chips?
no, i don't want the chips, dan.
i think they put spice in it.
feels better.
you ruined the case, dan...
but the state's case.
you mean the case of your ex?
they're finishing the investigation.
that means no more department earnings.
department income?
did you fight crime with stone and sticks?
you need financial resources for a research.
you know what?
good luck to you.
you'll see.
good day to you all.
see you in hell.
here it is.
i thought you might remember this.
you're absolutely right.
hey, do you have any nicotine gum with you?
i can't imagine myself without them.
because i left those cancer sticks.
that's it.
okay, we need to do some errands.
first, i have to get myself a shotgun.
you misunderstand!
there's a misunderstanding!
please!
i made a deal when you were in jail.
for both of us.
what kind of deal?
heroin.
south america.
i put it in one of our trucks.
i have a client.
and that's just the beginning.
if he does business, we bring in more heroin.
wayne, we're so close!
you meet the guy and we make the delivery.
what about the cops?
they can't come after you've crossed the border!
cops can't do anything!
rough day?
yeah.
is it about the girl or the job?
you're gonna need a second donut.
hey, dan.
what's up?
of course, yes.
i'll bring liz up this in the morning.
i'll call you back.
don't move!
okay.
okay.
don't move!
i'm not moving!
why are you attacking me?
you're harming the sacred bond.
i got three warrants on me.
it's not the first thing to do with cops.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
how would you feel if the warrant was removed?
what do you mean, "stay off"...
"julius, you don't have to go to jail"?
because that's what happened to me.
i'm all yours, man.
you can do whatever you want to me.
i want to know about wayne young.
i know that.
i know wayne young.
as you wish?
all i want is a piece of paper, pen and writing...
do it.
he has a place in oakwood, okay?
that's it.
does that make us good?
we'll put him in jail...
we're fine.
okay.
because i want to embrace you.
you can hug me.
all right.
thank you very much, man.
okay.
okay.
what can i do for you, jack?
i was talking to dan...
it means everything by the book...
not exactly your partner's style.
actually, that's why i can send him home.
don't worry about it.
just let me know how to fight wayne.
okay.
i'll see you at the office at 0:00.
wayne works in a garage in the east dallas.
he works for a company like shell.
but what do we arrest him for?
we'll think of something when we get there.
no, dan.
we'll do a "check research."
yeah, that'll work.
by the way...
how'd you know where wayne works?
am i still under oath?
this is the address.
hello!
that's weird.
what did you say about coming in and looking at the truck?
what about this?
are we going to fight back without permission?
they should know security's a mess.
besides, nobody gets in here without a helmet.
you mean us?
hey, ours is a violation.
well, that goes without spending more than $0.00.
so it works for me.
law is like a woman...
it makes you angry, but it won't do anything to calm you down.
everything gets worse.
what is this place?
what are they doing here?
we don't know...
i have to call liz.
just...
dan, what are you doing?
dan, we can't be here.
and what you did was illegal, dan?
okay?
this truck is full of boxes.
yeah.
boxes full of crime.
come on.
we're on a 00-foot drop.
i can feel the leaking in my waist!
another excuse for the report.
listen, dan.
we got off on the wrong foot here, okay?
did you hear something?
start the car.
i'll close the back.
dan, this is an illegal investigation, okay?
if we get caught, we're in big trouble!
your phone is ringing.
jesus!
i hate this.
hello.
hello, detective dan.
i'm julius, man.
how's our parole deal?
hey, i can't talk now.
i'm behind wayne young's truck.
it's a long story.
there's a man with a big gun...
caesar's right to caesar, paco.
looks like things are going well.
glad you didn't blow my head off with the shotgun, did you?
it was just a little misunderstanding, wasn't it?
yeah.
let's make some money.
yeah, me too.
shit!
what the hell is that?
thanks for coming.
i die slowly.
you look good.
i'm not okay.
you know my parole.
the cop i made the deal with was trapped in one of wayne young's trucks.
there are no trucks inside!
i mean, i have a boyfriend inamaika.
maybe we'll come back here and open up a motel.
okay, but why am i here?
you'll introduce me to wayne young.
you two are friends, she...
that's a very meaningful word.
more like colleagues, man.
sometimes he asked me to take weed to the north, that's all.
skeeter, dear...
you need to find this truck, and you need to find it now, man.
look, i'll give you $000.
this guy can't, man!
he cut off a man's thumb once!
it was like his fingers were missing!
that's gross, man!
i love this car.
including the sound system?
and the jants?
you can have them.
you can have the ashtray too, skeeter.
just find the truck for me, okay?
all right, i'll help you find the truck.
i didn't mean to yell at you.
the real joke is there.
they won't investigate the whole cargo.
what the hell was that?
don't panic.
dan, this is texas, okay?
you just described 00,000 square miles.
goddamn it!
then let's break the door so we can jump out.
what's wrong?
physics, dan.
it's suicide.
not if you jump fast enough, man.
we'll take the speed of the truck down to zero.
come on.
why are you acting like it's a bad thing?
we found wayne young right where we wanted him.
yeah.
it's a two-way highway in a countryside.
exactly.
i'm detective jack bailey.
please leave a message and i'll call you back.
well, it's been 00 minutes.
congratulations.
you're officially going the same way with your partner.
still waiting for your boyfriend?
detective bailey's not my boyfriend.
jack.
wherever you are, i hope you're having fun.
all i know is they're somewhere south.
how are you?
thanks a lot.
man, what took you so long?
dude, you asked me to find a criminal, didn't you?
can we just focus, please?
where's the truck with the cop in it?
that way.
so i'm just gonna go this way?
what's gonna happen on that road?
i'm working on the rope planes.
dude, you...
i think he had a deal with a guy.
dude, you're gonna kill me.
you'll definitely kill me.
do you know anything else?
i heard it was a frightening look.
and he's not from this country.
we can make the deal thursday.
i'm not british.
south african.
yeah, there's a giraffe in south africa.
see you thursday.
that's it.
coming with you wasn't part of our deal.
hey.
do you want my car or not?
yes, i do.
that's what i thought.
thank you.
good night.
you have interesting friends, man.
he was wearing weird boots, man.
i have those boots!
yeah.
what else was i supposed to do?
we're partners, right?
you would have done the same for me.
any other deals?
anything i should know?
that's it.
dan, what are you doing?
good luck.
i'll take care of it.
what are you doing?
don't i look like someone who's trying not to go crazy?
apparently.
i haven't opened them all yet.
especially the smells?
let me ask you something, dan.
like i said, these boxes are full of crimes.
yeah...
are you thinking about helping?
this needs to be a bit more light.
mysterious sunrise.
natural.
i like that.
don't die on me, dan.
don't die on me, dan.
don't die on me, dan.
dude, would you shut up?
i'm trying to talk on the phone!
yeah.
sort of.
in lubbock, "lill's antique shop."
i don't know, man.
it's like a souvenir shop.
besides...
jesus.
i've learned some information about the south american man.
perfect.
just focus on where the deal goes.
save the moustache.
save the moustache.
the smell of the candles is starting to drown me.
smells like a mysterious sunrise.
i think i'm gonna throw up.
if you vomit, i'll light more candles.
no.
give me that.
at least 0 kilos.
heroin.
it's heroin.
it's high-story.
small particles.
probably asian.
wow, you know a lot about heroin.
thank you.
so you're saying you planned this?
i mean, being a cop is a team thing.
you and me, jack.
that's how we ended things together.
really?
we'll say, "take it, wave, catch it again."
the bad cops are the only ones with guns, chasing the perp.
the good cops are on the team chasing criminals with guns.
thanks for the career advice.
hey, listen, dan...
what?
the truck is stopping.
why did we come so early?
what kind of problem did you choose?
this small town is in full state.
i mean, the nearest police are 000 miles away.
we don't have to get caught.
we're not even here.
just in case.
hello.
don't worry about armed men.
mikkel likes to carry heavy guns just in case.
i'm not worried.
it's so good to see you.
looks like we're doing a little work.
take the pump down.
get on your knees.
excuse me?
i said, "get on your feet."
hey, hey, hey, hey, cowboy.
what you're doing here...
what the hell is going on here?
i'm sorry, wayne.
i made a deal, you son of a bitch!
everybody wins.
exactly.
what?
okay.
okay.
no confusion.
how was the meeting?
neither is believed.
we'd better shoot them both.
sneaky son of a bitch.
i should have killed you when i had the chance.
enough!
let's finish this.
get heroin here and get out.
open the truck.
smell that?
come on!
come on!
remember, stick to the plan.
just the two of them.
we'll meet unexpected elements.
we'll disable them with a major attack.
come on!
what the hell?
do you have a plan "b"?
come on, run!
shoot them!
traitor, sly son of a bitch!
i don't like your plan "b"!
isn't it a little early for you to come visit here, counselor?
i heard the dan stark fiasco.
what happened?
this is detective bailey.
he usually comes around hot.
i found an address on jack's desk last night...
hey!
we had a deal!
good day.
looks like you're in a bit of trouble.
not as much as it looks.
i think we're safe for now.
don't say "we're safe" again!
let's go!
who are these guys?
i don't know, and i don't care.
just kill them all and bring me the heroin.
cover me.
i'll call the lieutenant and call for backup.
lieutenant ruiz.
yes, lieutenant!
this is detective bailey!
you haven't checked in in the last six hours.
where the hell are you?
it's a long story, okay?
detective stark and i need backup.
send me the code 0 as many men as you can!
"lill's antique shop." uncle.
00 minutes from lubbock.
all right, we're under heavy fire!
that's two hours away, detective.
what the hell are you doing there?
it's a long story.
just as long as you can send him, okay?
we're too late, man.
we're too late.
this silly deal happened five minutes ago.
where's the address?
there must be a place around here.
man, come on.
here?
yeah.
he's back.
we just passed.
this is not a safe driving style!
then you talk to my driving.
reinforcements arrive in 00 minutes.
that sounds about right.
we gotta get the bad guys backed up.
we'll fight the cavalry on the way.
good idea, dan.
right in front of you.
look!
if we're going to die, this must be in a real car!
ready?
i'm waiting for you to say, "let's go."
let's go!
get in the car!
go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
don't you know how to contact?
what did they teach you at the academy?
go!
go, go, go, go!
son of a bitch!
you!
can't you make it go any faster?
he had a good engine!
this car is dead!
maybe we should have taken sedan.
you want some?
dan, when did you get that chocolate?
i went back to the store while you were on the phone.
the almond walnut...
son of a bitch!
i want that heroin!
i don't think it's too good anymore!
what, you don't think i noticed?
take it!
come on.
come on!
hang on.
good!
that's exactly what i wanted it to be.
that's what scared me.
no one moves.
i think we're perfectly safe now.
you see what i see?
it looks like a truck of fire.
i got it!
i dropped it!
get down!
are you okay?
yeah, i'm fine.
but i've just been better.
yeah.
you bastard!
i got it!
he's taking heroin away.
jack.
partner, we have a bigger problem.
lower your weapons.
where's heroin?
you're lying!
he's not lying.
we left him in the middle of the road.
"paco" took him away.
who are you?
what were you doing behind the truck?
we're police officers.
are you a cop?
are you kidding me?
i'm not.
julius!
you did it!
i'll explain later.
can i hug you?
yeah, you can hug me.
come on!
okay.
you better get out of here.
get a license for your gun!
what was that all about?
we embraced.
i'm a hugger.
it was like a walnut fuselage number 00.
anyway, he ran here...
no sign of paco.
what about heroin?
no sign of him either.
apparently, he took her away.
no witnesses.
and wayne young will testify against paco.
and i'm sure he'll say,
"i'll drag that foxhole into hell with me."
well, that'll work.
yeah, but you know what won't work?
i didn't get involved in that.
it just happened.
you came all the way out here because you were worried about me?
no.
i came all this way to see wayne young's arrest.
i'm so sorry, jack.
well, i stole a sports car and set fire to it.
did you think about that too?
we're interrogating the south african man.
did you know the giraffes live there?
it's like halloween.
dan, we stole the pure heroin, okay?
it's hard to accept it as a victory.
"i can't say we lost."
what do you mean?
don't say "we're safe" again!
cover me.
i'll call the lieutenant and call for backup.
yes, lieutenant!
this is detective bailey.
it's a long story, okay?
send me the code 0 as many men as you can!
hey, old man...
sorry about the shooting.
how much for this doorman?
five dollars.
this is brick.
that's hand paint.
i'll give you three.
okay.
here you go.
three dollars.
how much is a chocolate chip?
it's 00 cents.
why did i do that?
i was hungry.
i'm not saying chocolate.
what made you change the packages?
well, you said it would all fit in the book, right?
yeah.
exactly.
i'm not wasting your time.
i brought you the best stuff.
this is the best heroin money can buy.
it's worth 000,000.
wholesale price.
here.
"remember the alamo"?
well, listen.
stop.
wayne young was captured in 00 hours and...
it's all $0.00.
actually, $0.00.
all i have to do is...
like i said, being a cop is a team thing.
but most of it's like water desert, no life.
the hunters here spend their lives in constant search of rare and difficult hunting.
000 tons of weight is 00 meters long, the biggest animal ever lived.
despite their enormous size blue whales are one of the most aerodynamic and energy savings within all swimming animals.
they can travel over 000 miles a day for the harts.
it takes a lot of effort to open the giant mouth, so it only does when you see a rich and dense of krill.
here, feeding opportunities are often rare.
when it's all over the hunters must continue their search.
the frigate birds are pirates of the open sea.
frigate birds must be very light because they can't have heavy oils that waterproof other sea birds.
small fish try to hide in the only shelter in the ocean among dead waves.
with extra thrusters in their tails, the flying fish can be airborne.
with a good wind, they can float hundreds of meters.
all open ocean hunters can't travel in search of food.
it's so hard to swim.
this brunette yosun fish has to sleep in the ambush with the moss.
in this ocean, with nothing special, these ducks will be very demanding of kittens who seek shelter.
it's the first time in weeks.
only a few inches away from his prey can make a move.
he's hiding in the moss by trusting his perfect camouflage.
the open oceans are most enormous, which some hunters can only find enough prey by searching for a team.
dolphins live in extremely advanced social groups.
by working together, they could cover a large area of the ocean.
small groups sometimes come together and make 0,000 super-dicks.
they use some kind of radar to find their prey, the "kolation."
but these small fish spend most of their time in the depths of the ocean where dolphins can't reach.
they only hunt when they go up to the surface to feed.
when they find a large number of them, dolphins use their radar for another purpose.
as the dolphins feed, they're coming from the bottom of the herd to prevent their prey from escaping back to safety.
the further we get down, the more food is on the surface, so the hunters must do everything they can to protect their precious energy.
most are dragged by tracing tentacles full of deadly needles.
others, on the other hand, are slowly heading for the dark, with the power of their roar.
beroe's the highest jelly in deep waters.
beroe has special mosquitoes in her mouth to catch her jelly prey.
this deep-water squid uses long, sticky tentacles to hunt.
the open ocean may be a wide blue desert, but like every desert, there are savages.
the mountains are forced to surface the nutrients by turning the direction of the deep ocean stream up.
success here depends on delicate maneuvers.
by hiding in a straight line of sight, giving your prey a false sense of confidence.
the lions of the lion fish are visualized, so it's hard to predict how close she is for hunting.
the extraordinary fins that he used to hide slowly tail moves make him superior.
the deep flow of water that keeps many calms is also attracting visitors to these savages.
they travel hundreds of miles between the sea mountains, where they use it to gather in the ocean where there's nothing special about it.
both shark species travel between galapagos and the other sea mountains of the great ocean.
no one knows why they're gathering so many, but some certainly come looking for food.
if these little fish stay close to the lentil, the sharks won't be able to reach them.
as long as the silver fish are close to the ocean floor, their predators will be overcome.
there's never an easy meal in the open ocean.
here, the storms that have been exposed are carving nutrients to surface nutrients.
black-eyed albatross are the same size as frigates, but three times as heavy, so he needs a totally different flight style.
albatross has the longest wingspan of any bird, and that enjoys the power of the south polar sea winds.
first, they glide in the wind, they use his energy to win high.
then they'll turn to the wind, and they'll win at speed.
most times when they're hunting, they spend weeks at sea without ever coming back to land.
since the winds here are so strong the albatross can't afford the fat that waterproof their feathers.
they can duck dive to a meter so they connect their prey to the south polar beings which will carry their prey to their range.
like all birds, albatross have to lay eggs on land, but in the south atlas, they're a very crowded crowd.
nearly half a million albatross cubs come here every year to raise their babies.
grown-ups are coming back to feed their babies in a few days, sharing parent duty.
when the feeding process is over, it's time to head for the sea.
the albatross are so heavy that they can only bark from where the wind is strong enough.
from the air, the ocean may seem irrelevant, but under the surface, there are powerful waxes with constant movement.
these senses are more effective than any other force that's determined to make life here.
all of the organisms that have been dragged into the ocean, they travel in this flow.
they come together to feed off the small plant and animals and the tiny plankton that the current brings.
the hair on his legs is slowing down his forehead, and they keep swimming up with a couple of hooks on his head.
the tide that carries these traveling crabs is a highway business for the ocean's big predators.
with the perfect aerodynamic structure, they can take the longest distance with asgari.
these hunters are a shuttlecraft among the oceans where hunts often meet.
every predator has an extraordinary sense of smell that perverts are left by the prey.
the great shoals are charmed by the plankton bolts.
a pack of sardines can be many miles long.
their self-defense depends on my digging.
when the attack arrives, the sardines move as one.
each fish instantly matches the movement of the one next to him, and the whole herd moves in full-time.
even when the sea lion comes, they don't seem to break the sardines' coordinated defenses.
a herd of sea lions would have to separate a lot of them from smaller control groups this size.
but with so little predator, the fish are still good.
all the sea lions can do is keep the sardines on the surface and wait for others to join them.
tuna attack from below, so the sardines cut their way to the deep waters.
as the fish are squeezing the purse, their packs are now easy on the hunters' business.
tons of sardines are running out of an hour.
the predators once again disappear into the blue.
this blue whale is still searching for food to make his hunger go.
because he's so big, he has to find an average of 0 tons of food every day.
a crowd of creatures trapped on the surface because of fish.
this blue whale has finally found what he's been looking for.
it's a big meal worth opening your big mouth.
the kril pile is hundreds of meters long, and the bottom is clustered.
the whales are moving at the speed of the hunt, targeting the busiest part of the pack.
you know, it takes a lot of effort to swim with a completely expanding throat, and the whale fits.
the whales use their tongue to get the water out of his mouth, and they save it in the plates that keep them in their mouth.
but it takes time to delete so much water.
blue whales may not be as agile as other hunters, but they don't have to.
no other hunters are better suited to take advantage of the messy riches that the open oceans provide.
the blue whale is the largest hunter in the world.
the open oceans have caused a lot of trouble to the "v" team.
doing this turned out to be a two-year mission.
team, the world's most important blue whale expert, worked with john calambokidis.
john got vital information from these harmless labels.
part of this research and the reason that we're working with the documentary producer is because it's a unique possibility that we can't afford to get scientific data.
so we're doing this under our research clearance as to how they're diving, how they swim, how they're feeding.
the team's success depends on a good underwater perspective.
too loaded and the whale disappears into the darkness.
we couldn't.
the first year she was impressed with vulnerability, and the shooting failed.
second year sea conditions are better.
blue whales only surface for about 00 minutes before diving.
he's got to try and move the boat forward to the whale, but not in front of it.
then he'll have to hope that david's going into the water and that the whale will get close enough to the rock.
this year the water is unusual, but it takes time to keep david in a good position.
after weeks of efforts, all the elements finally come together and give david the chance of his life.
it was too much, too long.
i mean, it was too big, like a loading train.
the blue whale images underwater are very rare, so it's a tremendous success to skip a simple swimming whale.
this series is all about hunting, so it's a good shot, but we need to get footage of the blue whales in order to complete the episode.
and we'll have to wait for the krill to come to the surface.
once a month maybe twice.
the crew is hitting a very promising signal, but it's a very unpleasant source.
look at those birds in the water!
we'll go take a look.
look at that saddle!
i still don't quite understand what i just saw.
david saw it, turned the camera.
he took a turn, went up and got a big bite.
the reason they call them blue whales is because you see them underwater, they come out of the blue of the ocean with bright, glowing cobalt blue.
i was upstairs trying to get another vision of the krill, and truth is, the mouth was open, and the last time appeared.
it's probably taken less than ten minutes, but without a doubt, without question, the most striking, most wonderful thing i've ever seen.
sharing the water with a blue whale, and it's something i'll never forget.
and the opposite turn.
yeah, that's the unique perspective we'll never see.
thanks to this close cooperation, the team took the blue whales as they'd never seen before, and in the end, the ocean's greatest hunter's life began to be exposed.
you like her!
no, i don't.
every friend i've ever introduced, he likes her.
pathetic, isn't it?
when mia went as an exchange student, we made a list of our plus and cons, and it helped clarify our feelings.
yes, ethan karamakov...
abigail searched and exits all school.
look, i'm coming to stay with you for a while.
no, i'm not gonna cause trouble.
i won't stay forever.
okay.
double batikent frapp.
and petit batikent.
everyone thinks the ranches are a dangerous place.
ryeve.
i know every rabbit hole, broken fence and rusty nail.
and nice arm wrists.
it doesn't matter where i am, i'm safe.
your wife's inside, tara.
and blance.
everybody, show up.
tara, you can join us.
but the academy is a completely different world.
if you think you know your way, think again.
you'll find you're in a minefield.
i see a new trap everywhere...
"he smells like christmas...
"the way he eats.
"everything she talks about is true."
could it be worse?
well, since you asked...
at least i'm not the first one on your list.
i think i should be grateful for that.
i'm really sorry, kat.
i didn't want to include you in my confusion.
believe me, i tried so hard not to feel like this.
here's a good reason.
my brother will break your heart, and when he does, i won't be there to fix it.
i promise i'll stay away from him.
do you think abigail sent it to third grade?
ethan read it.
kill me.
yes, one question.
who can tell me the real meaning of 'pas de deaux'?
pas de deaux.
it means "dance dance."
but what does it mean beyond french words, metaphorically?
pas de deaux.
two bodies, one soul.
a man and a woman dance with the same pure emotions.
this is what our class is about today.
i've never danced with a man before.
that's right.
back home, girls danced with girls.
there were no guys.
men in first class are just cute creatures that mash their fingers.
pas de de deaux has three important rules.
trust.
throw it at someone.
together.
great
and, most important of all, communication.
without these, yes...
ethan, isabelle, nice of you to join.
remember, to be together, you have to trust and communicate.
are your hands always this clingy?
i'm allergic to you.
focus on who you're dancing with.
no one else should matter.
you want to drop it?
relax.
you're doing very well.
what a wonderful class?
i mean, patrick's such a wonderful teacher.
don't you think the universe is trying to put us together?
la-la-la-la-la.
before we left, we talked to miss raine about not teaching the rest of your days.
don't get too excited.
instead, you're gonna do an exercise for me.
don't forget, you'll be valued without the practice of your other lessons.
that was a blow!
i'll be walking a blindfolded dog.
at least you don't have to spend 00 hours with abigail like me.
i'd rather stab my eyes with a blind knife.
i know, we'll ask our wives 00 questions in 00 hours.
this?
"may one of you ask any questions
"but you must answer truthfully."
like i want to know something about christian.
so you're not alone.
i'm a spring burcu, my favorite food is pizza, i don't have a lucky number, and we're done.
i know all about you.
your whole school is being published alive.
where are you going?
the beach.
i love this city.
i want to check it out.
i'm going to find christian.
we'll be there, checking on the pretty girls.
great!
oh, i'm starting to like this paper.
are you a hunter or something?
so where did you grow up?
a bathroom.
by the beach?
you're lucky.
you think i'm rich?
do you have a brother or sister?
he lives in broken hill.
i mean, emotionally close.
i mean, the room is flesh and blood.
he's doing something.
you have to answer.
says who?
rules.
how far did you go with a man?
there's first stage.
and there's phase two.
anybody in your city?
have you ever kissed a guy?
you didn't kiss, did you?
maybe i can help you.
maybe you can get out of my sight.
hey, i just had some more questions to ask.
and i'm trying to strengthen my stomach here.
we can do that on the beach.
i don't come to the beach.
are you allergic to fresh air?
i don't like sand, i don't like salt and i don't like the sun.
great.
i have to drink water.
me too.
we hate you enough to ask you to die of thirst.
i don't care what his favorite color or his family does.
so did he say anything to you?
he did it!
"oh, let's go to the beach to do the homework.
"it'll be fun!"
i didn't know he'd be here.
really.
what are you doing here?
we're coming to ourselves in third grade.
you shouldn't be here bitching.
you can play with us if you want.
i may be blindfolded, but i'm not blind.
come on, it's just football.
whoo!
are you coming, tara?
i think i'm staying.
i haven't finished my homework with christian yet.
come on, we're out of here.
you know, in this scenario, the bathroom's in the script.
you can hold on.
no, i can't hold it for 00 hours.
i'm starving.
yeah, me too.
i'm gonna...
i'm gonna go get some food.
this place is confined to smoking.
find another bathroom.
why do men have to smell so bad?
why do you have to be so bad?
that's right.
they stink.
it was more than just the crime you did.
just think about it, and get it over with before we die of oxygen.
i can't, please, can you hump a song or something?
hurry up.
i still don't understand why he sent that list to everyone.
you're just as disturbed as a fly who keeps buzzing.
that only makes you look bad.
okay, don't say anything.
there you go.
hey, where's tara?
i don't know.
huh.
whoa!
hey, baby.
i have a barracks in my lap.
hey!
i wrote that, princess!
come on, we'll catch them later.
you want to die?
didn't you see what they were trying to do to me?
you can't fight around here.
anyway, what are you still doing here?
if you want to know, i was waiting for the bus.
why did you see me in a limo?
you don't know anything about me.
i don't think i want to know.
i've never met anyone so rude.
didn't your mother teach you manners?
he's dead.
look, if you're worried, all you have to do is call.
who said i was curious?
i'm just checking my messages.
what do you know?
i can understand anything.
this communication thing must be working.
yeah?
can you see this?
ow.
i can't imagine what it's like to lose your mother.
no, you can't.
was she dancing?
yes, he was young.
is that why you wanted to go to the academy?
are you going to leave?
i won't.
i don't believe you.
i saw how you dance!
right.
he lives in broken hill.
very good.
and let's say i got in trouble.
i don't know, probably.
you said you were close.
so you're saying he answered, right?
brothers help their brothers?
maybe until you call him.
the room only calls for another number, so she doesn't know it's me.
now you know everything.
right or wrong?
i'd like to say wrong, but...
see, you learned nothing.
my brother and i are very close.
i have one question left.
question 00.
go ahead.
why did you tell everyone i was dressing in the wrong locker room?
you knew it was by mistake.
why would i even bother?
i don't believe you, you're still lying about it.
i know you did.
you know, i wasn't the only guy there.
have you thought about it?
tara, what were you thinking?
do you think there's...?
do you think it says 0-0 or 00?
it says two and four hours.
you want to know why i feel bad for tara?
because the three of you are so stupid!
i need to talk to you.
like you don't know.
you've been laughing behind me all this time, haven't you?
excuse me?
at the beginning of the audition week... you told everyone i was in the wrong locker room.
it was you, wasn't it?
come on, admit it was a funny thing.
and leave me on the beach alone?
that's fun, right?
but you weren't with us.
you're not gonna answer an extra list?
i didn't realize i should answer.
of course you had to.
the whole school's laughing at me because of you.
why should it be because of me?
look, if you want to hear the truth, i was ashamed of that list.
i mean, we've only talked to you three or four times, right?
and you went and wrote everything you felt and sent it to the whole school.
i don't even know you.
tara?
tara?
he can't talk to you.
yes, he can.
i thought you were sick of girls coming to you after ethan.
because i hate seeing my friends get upset.
growing up, my parents warned me of all danger.
we have to make it all ourselves...
prove to me yesterday's paper is not a waste of time.
good job, boys.
like it or not, for the next year, we're all bound by ropes that aren't gonna rip each other off.
so there's a long way ahead of us.
morning.
morning, bette.
uh-huh.
come on, get dressed.
i want to be there when they open.
okay.
i already threw a candy in it.
one is enough.
here's your napkin.
you want butter?
here you go.
morning.
be careful.
the inspector's here.
morning, mrs. tremont.
morning, mr korman.
mr. tremont.
hi.
yeah.
what can i do for you, mrs. tremont?
it says here that the pork chops are sold.
what you saw in the meantime, all in advertising.
how are those pork chops?
we're not selling them.
the commercial only says pork chops, mr korman.
no pictures, no id numbers.
so what do you want, mrs. tremont?
i want these ribs from that price.
all right.
jake.
hey!
jake.
ah...
first of all, i'm sorry that this thing stays on you, john, but we have a personnel problem to know.
this guy we're getting, he can't decide between us and goldman.
i know you hate this, but i need you to step in here and use your magic wand.
is the guy that good?
let's not miss this guy.
these kids from business school think they're worth $000,000 after they work a week.
i hate that attitude.
okay, set it up with kathy for the weekend.
i got notes for the next day.
the vale project has given us a lot of ground, but management is against our suggestions that we should know why the investors are so profitable.
they don't want to give so much information to their competition.
i don't know why we should cooperate with this vale guy.
a dark type.
we're risking the reputation of the company.
if we refuse him, we'll never get his job again.
the giant charge requests and the banking department wants this job.
i'm worried about my wife this year.
lower your price.
i think it's the early worm that records all over the landfill.
yeah?
your sister's on the line, mr. tremont.
he says it's important.
he should talk to you right away.
i'm in a meeting.
john, this is about our mother.
he had a heart attack.
he's okay now, but he's serious.
can you come?
hey!
how was your flight?
it was good.
the guy next to me didn't leave me alone.
he heard i was on wall street, so don't ask.
"what about this stock?
i see.
have you ever heard of a stock called chrometex?
mario.
seriously, someone mentioned the math department.
they produce heat sensors for the shells working at low temperature.
it'll be bigger than the phone.
it won't.
no?
no.
fine.
at home with your father.
home or hospital first?
it doesn't matter.
let's go to the hospital.
that's what i thought.
how's dad?
to be honest, johnny, he's a little shaken up.
that's why annie's staying with her.
he doesn't want her to be alone.
so how's mom?
how serious is he?
she doesn't admit she had a heart attack.
he's lying there because of a heart attack, and he claims to have indigestion.
he blames me.
what do you mean?
he says it's because of the sausages i made for dinner.
he claims i was trying to kill him.
did you?
no jury can accuse me, john.
i believe you.
if you're here, i'm pretty sick.
look, mom, that's why you're the best.
in your case, a lot of people wouldn't feel guilty.
how are you?
are you in pain?
i'm alive because of my will.
he'll tell you.
i have the will of a woman half my age.
don't throw yourself on the plate.
did you see your father?
no, i came straight here from the airport.
if you see him, don't say anything about a heart attack.
just tell me something went wrong inside me.
okay?
mom.
listen to me.
just tell her i got a problem.
my womb would think i'm sleeping because i'm being taken.
okay.
if you have to eat outside, go to mcclardald's or wendy's.
somewhere simple.
mom, you shouldn't worry about dad right now.
i think you should think about yourself right now.
you had a heart attack.
i'm not sure i had a heart attack.
that hurts like more gas pains to me.
mom, if you had a gas pouch, they'd have given you the acid dealer.
they wouldn't tie you to $00 million worth of machinery.
did you see the doctor who took care of me?
because i don't believe he's a real doctor.
he was wearing a tight pants with a big silver knob on his belt.
he can't be more than 00 years old.
nowadays they graduate from medical school.
john!
god, it's so good to see you.
you came and saw your mother first, huh?
yeah.
tell you the truth, john, how he looked at you.
like mom.
it was like dragging serum bottles out of there.
i mean, it's just gas pains.
i'm sure he told you that, too.
and the will?
like a half-year-old woman.
you look so modern.
where should i put your bags, sir?
oh, that's a lot of trouble.
thank you very much.
no luggage in the living room.
you know the rules.
i'm getting them out of your old bedroom.
is the living room still off-limits?
you're kidding.
this looks like the same smithson's.
dad's out, huh?
yeah, in the greenhouse.
what's he doing there?
mario said he agreed to this very hard.
he's scared, john.
he's really, really scared.
i'm not sure you understand what's going on with him.
what do you mean?
he saw her, didn't he?
i didn't want to drag him there.
i told him no visitors were allowed, and he seems to understand it.
hello, dad.
hello, john.
good to see you.
you look good.
good to see you, too.
i'll stay here for a few days.
did you hear what happened to your mom?
how is she?
fine.
fine.
he asked me to say hello and said he'll be home soon.
something's wrong with your body, isn't it?
something like that.
your old room's not working, you know.
you should use a second blanket.
okay.
as long as you're here, the most important thing is to make sure everything goes well.
your mother has a calendar, and her life is a really long routine.
and a candy.
in the morning the coupons will cut and make a shopping list.
this is important.
i wrote you a list of pills.
when did she get so bad?
it's been a year since i saw him.
no, you're wrong.
what are you talking about?
i was here for christmas.
annie, i need to know.
okay, i saw him two years ago.
a lot happens in two years.
why didn't you tell me?
i tried to get him to us, but he wasn't comfortable.
we've been working all day.
but there's the garden and the greenhouse.
he knows the environment.
i can only stay here for a few days.
then what do we do?
can't you stay longer?
i have to go to boston.
no way.
we should get someone home.
but we have to find the right person.
my father is old, john.
yeah.
come on, dad, let's hit the head, huh?
johnny.
i can't find my pajamas.
i don't know where your mother put them.
here.
why don't you put them on, dad?
i'll wear it.
are you okay?
i miss your mom.
he'll get what he needs.
good rest.
he'll be home soon.
good night.
good night.
leave the hall light on.
okay.
sleep tight.
i don't eat much in the morning, johnny.
it was good, though.
thanks, dad.
you're making a lot of food at home, aren't you?
not really.
i've been eating out since sara and i divorced.
yeah, she was a nice girl.
still is.
how's billy?
he's in santa cruz now.
first class in college.
he came to visit once.
i mean, you saw him more than i did.
look at that, johnnie.
it's double coupon day at ralph's.
two cans of tuna, $0.00.
amazing.
how much for a tuna in new york?
it's not $0.00, i bet.
no, i disagree.
no way.
listen, dad, i'd like to talk to you for a minute about mom.
you have something important to understand.
my mother is sick.
it's not cancer, is it?
no, no, not cancer.
it kills cancer, you know.
your uncle ben had five surgeries.
nothing's done to her.
i'm telling you, if you have cancer, you must pack your bags.
look, it's not cancer.
a heart attack.
will he be okay?
yeah, he'll be fine.
but he can't work as hard as he used to.
he'll have to learn to take it easy, and you have to help him with it.
i keep telling her that you work too hard.
johnny, he's working hard.
you need to know some things you can do at home.
listen, mommy made you believe no one else can look at you except her.
we're gonna try and fix this wrong for him.
got it, johnny.
i'll find out how to do all this.
you'll see.
we'll make fun of him.
okay, dad, the first thing we have to do, let's see,
"leave the colours from the whites."
that way, black materials don't mix in white colors.
copy that.
i think that's what your mom would do.
now we know we're on the right track.
okay, let's start with the colors, shall we?
they're coloured.
color.
white, color, color.
white.
color.
color.
what about this?
him?
he's white.
okay, it's colorful.
dad, he must be one of those.
i think we should call your mom.
i'm gonna make a death here.
okay.
what do you think we have?
"well, normal.
i'm tryin' normal.
what kind of water should we use?
"cold-cold, cold-cold, warm-hearted, warm-up."
what the hell is that?
hot- hot.
i think he was white.
it'll be ready for thursday.
yeah.
what's the easiest way to get to the store from here, dad?
i don't know these streets very well, john.
your mom will take us anywhere we need to go.
don't you ever drive?
nothing?
i can't.
my license expired a few years ago.
didn't you get another license?
well, they wanted me to take a test for my age.
you failed the test?
i didn't take the test.
i was afraid i wouldn't pass.
what are you talking about?
you used a great car.
johnny, a good driver knows when he can't drive a good car, that's all.
i couldn't remember what you liked, so i took less than anything.
great.
well...
these are beautiful.
i want to see your mother, johnny.
i don't think that's a good idea right now, dad.
i mean, my mom's fine, but they wouldn't want to accept a visitor.
i'm her husband.
i need to see him.
that's not true.
perfect.
he made me breakfast this morning.
no, i'm not serious.
i don't know, he set up a box.
yeah.
everything's fine.
okay, bye-bye.
okay, dad.
annie's meeting the people at the hospital.
he thinks they can let you meet in a day or two.
good.
yeah.
what?
i can wash dishes.
i've encoded these cards in color.
here are different cards for daily homes.
for example, now, the pink ones are for washing dishes.
go ahead, take a look and see the number.
number one:
"fill the bathroom with water."
okay.
number two?
"go and add some soap."
okay.
"find the water with the clothes on."
i made these for you to work on your own.
these are great, johnny.
if i follow these cards, there's no reason for me to make a mistake.
i'm gonna watch this.
i'll show you how to burn the stove, dad.
no, on the other hand, the leg is now off-limits.
no fire.
and stay away from that blender.
no flapping.
i think i should work with this.
your mother wouldn't want me to wear this.
i look so rude.
like johnny cash.
that's not what you think, is it?
no, dad, i don't think so.
don't take your guns into town, son.
leave those guns at home.
bang, bang.
"fill the bathroom."
the floor was professional, dad.
you can see yourself in the floor.
there's no cila yellow mark.
you know what i think?
i think we should reward ourselves.
what do you mean?
let's go out and have a good time.
what are you saying?
okay.
okay.
what do you and mom do here for fun?
"i" 00.
"i" two-zero.
"o" 00.
seven-five.
"b" 00.
"b" is-one.
look at the top, all right?
"g" 00.
"g" five-eight.
are you kidding me?
isn't the air conditioning working here, dad?
or a fan or something?
"i" 00...
chicken!
i love it when they do that.
do they always?
"b" 0.
and after!
boy, this evening is so much fun.
"i" 00.
bingo!
bingo!
jake tremont, is that you?
hal mccarthy.
how are you?
remember gloria?
my son, john.
he came from new york to visit.
how are you?
bette here?
no, he's in the hospital.
that's good to hear.
give him our best.
we will.
thanks.
you heard about nick price, right?
he's dead.
oh, yeah.
nick, robin, dorothy, the twins.
all of them.
the whole table.
and delores patcher, next door.
gone.
he's dead.
well, it's good to see you again.
it's been a while.
a long time.
nice to meet you.
they're like a fresh air.
i know your bingo.
you haven't been here a while, have you, father?
when was the last time you played here?
it's been three years.
you're kidding.
why did you stop coming?
i don't know.
we used to have so much fun with your mother here, more than anyone, but...
we don't do what we love anymore.
i don't know why.
i think you should remember what you enjoy and start doing them again.
that's a good idea.
john, i'll write this down.
i'll make a list of things we enjoy.
yes, sir.
bingo.
what?
i think you did bingo.
hey, i got bingo!
i was worried about you, john.
i'm afraid you're gonna have to add up.
we should take a look at this.
we can win, and we can make a regular win.
i know a computer guy in new york, i'll consult him.
it's great with numbers.
he'll build a system for us.
you'll see.
we're gonna beat these guys, dad.
i'm sorry, i didn't mean to leave you so late.
it's like christmas night.
the only thing missing is guy lombardo.
he's dead.
i'm surprised hal mccarthy didn't mention it.
big day tomorrow.
better go to bed.
good night, john.
good night, dad.
"b" 0.
and then.
there they are, dad.
hello, dad.
you're kidding me.
you ready to see him, dad?
i can't believe how good dad looks.
you think so?
thanks to you, john.
i'm good because of him.
that was fun.
listen, i hired someone to keep an eye on the house.
it'll be a day or two.
i can stay home until mom gets home.
really?
yeah, no problem.
hey, bette.
are you okay?
uh-huh.
do you swallow your blood pressure pills?
are you eating?
yeah, i'm fine, bette.
i can make my own bed now.
and i wash dishes.
john's teaching me to cook.
he's like a real wife.
just keep her alive until i get back.
thank you for your bet.
mom looks good, doesn't she?
yeah, great.
i can't go anywhere without my tubes.
i meant your face color, mom.
my color?
what are you, a decorator?
don't call me mom.
am i calling you son?
don't be so kind to my mom, mario.
you'll kill him.
why are you cooking?
there was food in the refrigerator.
i told you.
we wanted a little change, that's all.
we had salmon last night.
we had coq au vin the night before.
your father doesn't like foreign food.
just chicken with red wine.
he shouldn't drink red wine.
mom, that's it.
i don't want him turning into alcohol while i'm here.
no one who eats coq au vin will be an alcoholic.
calm down, bette.
don't worry about everything.
just focus on getting better here and don't worry about me.
are you sure you want to come, dad?
it'll be a long meeting.
no, i'll come.
it'll do me good.
i could buy you a lunch here and watch a movie.
i'll sit down, read a magazine.
i'll be fine.
okay.
john tremont, i'd like to see vic walton, please.
he's waiting for you.
dad, can you be comfortable here among all the repairs?
of course, no one falls on me.
john, glad to see you.
sorry for the confusion.
good to see you too, vic.
this is my father, jake tremont.
dad, this is vic walton.
nice to meet you, mr. tremont.
me too.
will we be here in an hour?
like i said.
okay, well, take care, dad.
wait a minute, wait a minute.
we can't leave your father here.
mr. tremont, why don't you come in and sit with us?
i don't think-
ralph, we've given you all the privileges and now our predictions, 00% less than yours.
how can you be so sure of yourself?
you-you've never followed a job like this.
and if you're wrong, we'll be the mask of the industry and we'll never be able to do business with you again.
forget about running the canned factory.
he loses money every minute he's left, but the land he's got is worth 00 million.
how can you be so sure of $00 million?
we could give it a little bonus for $00 million.
do you have any backup?
can i go back to the location now?
the arsan's real value is that we don't have a problem with every transport job around $00 million.
they can take on all general expenses, but we have a plan to remove 00% of the executive staff in just a few months.
isn't it enough just to sell?
and that's how you handle accounting records.
if this goes well, you won't have to.
i don't think they're focused on that.
we can change that.
the other thing is food wholesale sales, it's a good sector.
now, our cash flow plans for the department appear to be counterfeiting, but they're not satisfied.
when we account for everything, we have no problem getting credit from the banks.
yeah, this looks good.
johnny, what's going on out there?
well, we're gonna get a salmon fish canned, dad.
i didn't know you had information about something like that.
actually, i don't know.
the guy who came to us for the money doesn't know.
we're just gonna get the company, and then we're gonna put an end to your activities.
is this your job?
you buy companies, then close them?
it's a little complicated, dad.
in this case, we're buying this canned canoe factory.
the company comes into a mess later.
this third generation's taking over, and the production is terrifying.
but there's a little paravanormal companies, and that's the mother-in-law.
the factory is built on a valuable land near the sea.
so we buy the factory, close it, then take over the front desk company, then sell the land.
have you ever thought about running these companies?
there's no money in that, dad.
the world has changed, johnny.
you can't believe how the world has changed.
when you were a little boy, you used to go to work for lockheed with me, remember?
i'd tear the vents apart and touch them.
they'd give you 00 cents a day, and i'd get a ham-and-cheese sandwich for that money.
you used to say you wanted to work there with me when you grew up.
but now, what you do is buy and then shut it down.
dad, did you hear about those lockheed guys?
rick malinson?
tommy williams?
they all moved away.
to the valley, palm springs...
there was no one there to say goodbye to me.
the next morning, there was no one doing my job.
the world leaves in two groups:
people and bosses.
i don't know, dad, i think...
it's all right, johnny.
there's nothing wrong here.
i'm a worker, that's all.
but you're different.
you like being controlled.
you like responsibility.
you're a boss.
mom?
what do you think?
okay, dad.
"if you hit a parked car and can't find the owner...
why are you doing this?
i already passed the written test.
i know, but you may not be too careful.
a lot of the samples here can go on a driver's license test.
i wanna get you ready for this.
very good.
thank you.
we've come this far.
i don't want to see anything go wrong now.
they want us to pull over here.
go ahead.
slow down, slow down, not so fast.
okay, stop.
there he is.
jake tremont?
actually, it's jake tremont.
i'm his son, john.
i guess you didn't have to know that, but you heard it.
you can't sit here during the test, sir.
oh, i'm sorry.
oh, you can't stay in the car.
what are you talking about?
this is my father.
those are the rules.
i won't test as long as you're sitting in the car.
you can come out now, or your father's failed the test.
everything okay?
if you do, it'll be fine.
as you get out of the parking lot car, the traffic is...
john?
i'm leaving.
i'll check the bike and other vehicles.
yeah!
while you're waiting to make a left turn, give yourself a priority to the vehicles from the mall.
make sure the vehicles are all dangerous.
yeah!
oh, look who's here.
hey, dad.
hey, billy.
hey...
my grandmother was sick.
i ran right away.
i thought you might need me, grandpa.
don't even think about helping your grandfather.
when was the last time you ate?
why are you americans so obsessed with food?
you know, when in rome...
what were you doing in mexico?
semester break.
a few friends of mine are there.
dad, you say that every time we see each other.
and i haven't grown up in two years.
how's your mother?
fine.
third year and class in law.
it's a shame if your mom gets more notes than you do, but we work.
send my love.
how are you?
sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
if i know you, you're making more than you've lost.
if you're done, why don't you take a piece of cake and look at it?
he looks good.
what's going on?
well, we spend a lot of time together.
good time, huh?
they say it's good for parents and children.
maybe you and i should spend more time together.
this place looks great, grandpa.
too much.
looking good.
i'll give it a name after you, bill.
butter, anyone?
you want some butter, honey?
i want to make a toast.
aha.
a lot has happened in the last two weeks.
we've overcome some adversity, some pain.
we breasted it all as a team.
it's thanksgiving time.
that was great, mario.
this is my usual speech.
actually, i just wanted to say how nice it is to see our family together and happy.
my chicken's getting cold.
it's over.
very good.
i also raise a toast.
hmm.
wow, dad.
to my lovely bride.
your bride?
have you had any today, jake?
before you came, mom, we drank a coq au vin.
to my lovely bride.
bette, welcome back to our family, where you are.
it's so good to be home.
listen, listen.
good talk, dad.
it's nice to have everybody here.
i don't remember the last time we were together with john and billy.
billy looks good.
i like that earring.
should i wear it too?
i got a needle to wake up if you want.
oh, leave him alone, mom.
looks great.
i bet they're gonna jump on girls.
don't worry about me.
it's not embarrassing.
the hostel was a girlfriend.
is that true?
yeah, well, our dorm's mixed with girls.
i'm glad that wasn't our time.
i wouldn't finish school if it was.
as if you were a student to me.
mario was a great student, mom.
he graduated from physics.
he didn't even read books, he licked.
yeah, but all the good students read books with me at the same time and ended a prank.
but john was a good student.
thank you, mommy.
every friday we would go out of the nest and go to the library.
we'd get 0 books.
you read them, we give them back, then we get 0 new books.
you did more than that.
so how did it work?
were the girls on the other floor?
somebody shut that guy up.
i'm just happy.
while you're here, let's make it easy for grandma and grandpa.
sure, you're used to hearing it, but you can't believe it's real.
i believe you, believe me.
my fillings are still pounding.
i'm sorry.
so when do you have to go back to school?
i'm not going back to school.
i'm thinking of hanging out in mexico for a while.
what's mexico's joke?
all mexicans try to get here.
did you know that?
there are some kids from school.
they're very similar.
that's, uh, that's good.
yeah, it's fun, but believe it or not, you're gonna want to work someday, bill.
lying on the coast of mexico won't do you any good.
if you don't want to be a marachi singer, no matter what, you have to finish a school.
i could say i went to college.
i got the doctor's degree.
i did the right thing.
two phds.
one is chemistry, one is physics.
i'll be back in new york soon, and i want to make this work.
what does your mother think?
he thinks i can make my own decision.
i'm not sure how i feel about this.
we need to talk more about this.
i don't understand why.
we've never talked about it, and i know what i want.
johnny, something's wrong.
can you come here and take a look?
that's enough, mr. tremont.
you can get dressed if you want.
is she okay?
yeah, fine.
there's a difficult process.
it hasn't spread yet.
what's your idea of the problem?
could be one of a few things.
i suspect he was a cyber at the urine.
the problem is, he's got a good heart.
will this appear in your tests?
not entirely.
her bleeding's not a good sign.
so this is serious?
i think we should put him through a general operation.
if it were serious, dad, they wouldn't have left you.
they would open you up right now and operate under the spotlight.
i wouldn't be surprised if it was just a cyst.
i don't think we should tell mom.
why worry if there's nothing there?
whatever you say, johnny.
you're the boss.
he told you, didn't he?
of course he did.
then you know there's nothing serious about it.
if it wasn't serious, you should have told me yourself.
look, mom, you should stay away from a possible stress right now.
you'll be sad when you stop.
that's why i didn't tell you.
he says it's just a cyst.
that's right.
it'll be a simple operation.
yes, it is.
mom, if anything went wrong, i'd tell you.
sure.
okay.
is this how i'm gonna walk, john, with my butt open like all the nurses here?
yeah.
that's what it says in the admitting form here,
"is illegal."
go to bed.
you gotta sign this, dad.
what is it?
i don't have any baseball gloves.
that was a bad joke.
dr. santana has prepared these meds.
it'll just help you relax.
if you have too much, i'll drink a piece.
extra money for the private room.
what time is it?
it's evening.
it's not too late?
no.
are you comfortable, dad?
fine.
i'll let you rest.
this thing'll make you sleep like a baby.
okay.
remember, if you need anything, just press this bell.
that's it, huh?
you'll be fine.
you know, john, i see some guys, they hug each other.
we never hugged.
shall we try?
come on.
i love you, johnny.
i love you, too, dad.
well, mr. tremont, i'm afraid it's cancer.
cancer.
we ran into a couple of bad-ass tumors.
your father won't be at his age.
well, it's a silly question, but are you absolutely sure?
yeah.
good thing we can reach him and destroy him.
listen, dr. santana.
whatever you do, don't tell dad you have cancer.
he's very agitated and afraid of that word.
say something more reasonable.
calm down, mr. tremont.
you'd be surprised what others have been through.
they don't even care about the kids.
i'm not underestimating it, doctor.
i just want to tell him myself, that's all.
it's cancer, isn't it?
mom, i told you.
it's just a cyst and they'll take it.
i want to see him.
mom!
mom, you can't see him right now.
will you listen to me?
you shouldn't be subjected to such stress.
if everything's all right, let me see him.
oh, come on, mom!
john only wants what's best for you.
you know.
you should listen to her, mom.
he's my husband and i'll see him.
you can either take me there now, or i can walk, but i'm leaving.
what's there?
billy, go find dr. santana.
come on!
get out of here.
what happened to him?
jake, it's me!
why didn't he know me?
jake!
mr. tremont, this is dr. santana.
do you know who i am?
i'm fine.
i'm fine now, thanks.
give me 00 mg librium and check it out in two hours.
okay, doctor.
that's exactly what happens with other patients.
they get shocked after every simple operation.
is that standard?
do you know what's going on in there?
i know it's a frightening experience for you, but what you have to understand is that there's a state of senility here.
he wasn't senile when he got here.
now why is he senile?
dementia is a strange thing.
it comes and goes.
a stress like this happens all of a sudden.
i'm sure she'll be fine with fine rest and medication.
what do we do in the meantime?
nothing.
what do you mean, "nothing"?
we wait for him to respond to medication.
did you tell my father he had cancer?
he has the right to know.
i'm not sure what you want from me exactly, mr. tremont.
dr. ethridge,
i don't trust santana.
you're the hospital manager, and what i want to say is that he's not comforting us.
dr. santana is a fine young surgeon.
apparently, he's been perfect and professional about your father.
i told him not to tell my father that he had cancer, because he's terrified of that word.
but what he did, he went right away and told him.
yeah, that's hard for every doctor to say.
he must balance the rights of your father with family members.
i'm sure he had no choice.
he had a choice.
he should have listened to me.
i know my father.
why did you tie his arms?
so she wouldn't hurt herself.
he was hitting himself with his hands.
well then, i'm his son, and i don't think he needs them.
let us know when you're ready, and we'll put him to bed.
i can't believe it.
hey, dad, how you doing?
does he always look like that?
look, hey, look, look, i brought annie.
and billy's here.
hey, dad.
how are you feeling, dad?
can you hear me?
hey, grandpa, it's me, billy.
how's it going?
god, john, i can't stand to be here looking like this.
i think that's enough.
i gave him a permit.
that should calm him down.
how long has he been like this?
all the time we've been here.
did she seem depressed?
jesus, doctor.
good thing you're not a detective.
yes, he seemed depressed.
what the hell is going on here?
i meant something unusual, mr. tremont.
mr. tremont-
don't keep telling me it's all right, doctor.
this extraordinary depression is not unusual, it's true, but the sedative will bring it to itself.
sedatives?
the guy's hallucinating.
the guy's yelling all the time.
he doesn't know anyone from his family, and you just gave him a sedative?
why didn't you give him the cake?
maybe his throat hurts too!
we've decided to release your father tomorrow.
you can pick him up after 00:00.
what do you mean, "study"?
you want to tell me that my father is cured?
well, of course not, but in medical language, there's nothing we can do to him.
we can't keep the beds free for patients who can't help the medical way.
how do we know?
he didn't get any medical help!
what exactly do you mean?
that's what i said.
that means they don't care if he's dead.
what kind of speech is that?
i didn't think-
just calm down.
you want my father out of here?
look what i'm gonna do.
i'll do better than you can.
i understand you can't take care of him.
john, what are you doing?
mr. tremont- don't touch him.
that's not necessary.
i'm saying i'll take him home.
mr. tremont, what you're doing is very nasty.
what do we do now?
i don't know.
we don't have much choice but to-
no, i don't want to do that.
i don't want to take her to a home.
so do i, john, but we have to do something.
wait a second, john.
you can't help her like this.
i think i can do this.
i'll do better than the hospital can.
i'll stay and help.
no.
why not?
i'll take care of him.
he's my father.
well, he's my grandfather.
i'm your father.
i don't want you here right now, billy.
you shouldn't see that.
dad, i'm not a kid.
look, i think you should go.
go back to school, go back to mexico.
you're from here.
don't you get it?
yeah, i got it.
i want to talk to him.
i don't think that's a good idea right now, mom, really.
annie's right, mom.
here's to the hearse.
you'd like that, wouldn't you, mario?
i mean, "get in the car," mom.
it was just a slip of tongue.
he'll be fine.
john will take care of him.
let's go, dad.
this gooden guy is awesome, isn't he?
stili reminds me of bob gibson.
you know, a real player.
did you get it, dad?
good.
here we go.
madensu.
we'll have to work on your technique.
okay.
what you need is a little home cooking.
well, i think he's right.
wait until you taste this.
come on, dad.
okay.
hmm, okay.
here.
try this.
come on, dad, take a bite.
come on, there you go.
let's take our chances.
dad, you can't bite the glass.
house rules.
you don't like it there, do you?
i don't like it either.
we're gonna be okay, huh?
come on, dad.
that's better.
okay, dad.
just hold on a minute and i'll put you to bed.
i'll just put these in.
why are we here, ed?
why aren't we at the ranch?
what?
you know, they'll wonder if we stay, you know.
where's the owner?
it's your house, dad.
what are you talking about?
mandy's not back from the field, ed.
i'm worried about him.
well, don't worry, dad.
i-i'm sure he's okay.
you think so?
yeah.
i need 00 nails for the hens, help me.
it has to be done now.
look.
what we need now is a good night's sleep.
you always say when there's a problem:
"let's lie on it."
i mean, we have problems right now, dad.
let's get to bed.
dad?
dad?
dad?
dad, where are you?
dad?
dad?
dad?
dad?
what the hell are you doing here?
oh, dad, come on, let me help you.
come on, dad, come on.
no.
dad, i'm gonna lift the bed.
come on out.
come on, dad, get out.
dad, come on.
i got you.
shh.
come on.
shh.
i got you, i got you.
i got you.
mr. tremont?
i understand you brought your father back to the hospital.
yeah.
i figured it would be hard for you to look at her at home.
that's not the place for him right now.
can't do it at home, can't do it here, can he?
maybe he'd better take a helicopter down the hill.
i know it's hard for kids to accept their parents getting older.
i know what that means.
i know what age is.
mr. tremont, you have to remember that doctors are human.
we can't handle all the problems.
we can't save every patient.
we live in a system where old people finally fall tough.
what is it you want?
why are you here?
there's another doctor in this hospital.
i think he can do better than dr. santana.
what?
i'm kicking everything that's been said.
he's a good man.
i want him to take a look at your father.
mr. tremont?
mr. tremont?
how are you, mr. tremont?
let's do some tests.
let's get an eeg and trace the metabolic change.
give us the kalishum-magnonium and we'll run vital function tests.
i'm not so sure what caused it, but now i've identified it as an epileptic.
the question is, what caused it?
and why isn't he conscious?
if you want to do any other consultations about this, please do it.
no, that won't be necessary.
well, like we said, don't think we're gonna sit here and do nothing.
we don't think so.
we've done a series of tests so far, and we'll do more.
all we've done so far is shoot in the dark.
i appreciate your humility, doctor.
but these tests have been done for a long time, right?
he'll be here for a while, so we'll watch him on the monitor any minute.
and i'll check and visit him twice a day.
i'm not gonna leave you alone until he gets better.
i'm afraid that's entirely against hospital rules.
how long can you take this?
i don't know.
i go once a day.
i'm sitting.
i'm talking to him.
i'm coming over and talking to the others.
i think if i sit there and i talk, he won't die.
what are you gonna do if he dies?
annie, i don't...
you're the only one who can't accept it, john.
why don't you let him go?
i can't explain it to you.
maybe i should be there when it's over.
i don't know.
to prove he was still here.
to prove i was his son.
so what have you done positive so far?
annie, this guy went to work every day in his life that he never loved.
we never asked him.
he did it because he was a father and he had no choice.
she never asked me if i'm happy for her own good.
he never knew if he had any right.
as a result of this election, we should look at him and take care of him.
but i messed it up.
john.
i'm embarrassed about him, but my mother was a rule to him.
he's getting old now.
i'm embarrassed because i've made a marriage that's bad, and i have a son that can barely see it on the street.
maybe it'll be too hard for me,
but i'll be with you when you die.
and i'll kiss her, and i'll cover her,
...and then i'll draw the gold i was there.
i owe him that.
when did you get to town?
i've never been.
i'm staying with some friends.
i didn't want to leave my grandfather.
you came here every day?
a nurse calls me when you're gone.
i've been standing around for about half an hour.
where am i, johnny?
you're in the hospital, dad.
i can understand that.
why are you here?
was there an earthquake or a traffic accident?
is she speaking?
yes, he is.
he's learning like a child.
go, uh, report this to dr chad.
please, please.
why did she look nice to me?
uh, she's-she's one of the hospitals, dad.
he's, uh, a nurse.
this is molly, this is cecey, uh, this is annie.
this is my father.
okay, mr. tremont.
how can we make you comfortable?
you can start with these pipes with the wire.
then i better eat something.
are you going to starve me here?
okay, we need to take it easy.
remember, you haven't eaten in a long time.
maybe that's why i'm like this.
have you thought of that?
all tests positive, vital signs stable.
and this is a healthy human profile.
i've seen people come out of a coma before.
we don't usually find out why.
i have some theories on this.
i can't say that.
like what?
somehow we've given him the enzyme that his brain isn't making, and we're lucky to have it.
i see.
you know, that's all we're saying when we get home.
but in return, it was your love and interest that brought your father back from where he went.
i think it's better this way.
me too.
they're here.
what's going on, dad?
what are you looking for?
your mother and i are starting a new life together, johnny.
we need some new clothes.
i don't know, dad.
what do you think mom would say about that?
he'll probably laugh and call me crazy, but he'll laugh.
we've been laughing at home for 00 years.
how about that?
thanks.
thanks, thanks.
ladies, ladies, our show is starting.
no matter how much you cheer during your performance, please remain in your seats.
the house is proud to present the number one star of our show, especially the late, glorious man, who has become one of the most successful tourists,
great jake.
give him a big round of applause.
come on, give it a big round.
here we go.
and his cuisine, billy!
ladies and gentlemen, billy!
this is my outfit for biking in venice on the beach.
maybe when you skate.
this is my baseball-watching outfit.
see?
i think i'll wear this more at home.
actually, i could go see a few games, but not in these clothes.
that's good to hear, jake.
wait.
there's another one.
do it again.
oh, i pissed in my pants!
stop them!
i'm dying!
i didn't hear anyone die laughing, bette.
but wouldn't that be nice?
i'm telling you, johnny, he's not the same.
maybe their hormones got mixed up with someone else's.
you know what happens in hospitals.
no one's gonna believe he's 00 years old, that he's about to die a few weeks ago.
you need to talk to someone, i mean it.
mom, he's just having fun.
we played one hole and still...
it's a wonderful day.
can you take us somewhere after breakfast?
that's a good idea.
maybe mom will come along.
i'm not getting in the car he drove.
he used to drive too fast.
i hate to think about what he likes right now.
don't worry about your pretty little head, bette.
while old jake tremont is on the steering wheel, you'll be safe for his own bed.
and that'll be fun.
what are you doing down there?
nothing.
i still want to see if i can do a push-up.
i call it the old man's pushup.
what are you gonna do, bette?
are you coming to the beach?
i'm coming, but with a taxi.
i don't want to go in a taxi.
i think we sail at santa monica.
it's the old people's paradise.
every corner is either a office or a bank.
i want to drive to venice.
oh, i used to love fishing.
where are my olta teams?
i think i put them in the garage somewhere.
that was 00 years ago.
i'll go get them.
he'll be fine.
johnny, i'm scared.
he's either talking about people i don't know, or people i'm sure are dead.
he says we live on a farm in cape may, new jersey, and that he'll take us there because it's harvest time.
what?
dad.
she told you, huh?
what's going on?
why don't you show me around the car?
john, i need to talk.
johnny,
...what are the chances i'm living on a farm with your mother and four kids in new jersey capes?
i don't think you have a chance, dad.
isn't there a chance he's on a small farm?
i don't have four kids there?
you, annie, hank and little lizbeth?
as far as i know, dad, you've been living in los angeles for 00 years.
you had a regular job until you retired from lockeed.
before that, we lived at the beachfield and you worked there for lockeed.
i know you're right.
i mean, how can you be in two places at once?
i mean, this is what my life is like here,
i'm just sitting there watching the ocean.
if this is too technical or too fantastic, just keep it to me.
your father, as laing described, "another schizophrenic".
over the years, he's not enjoying his everyday life enough, and he's isolating everything he's enjoyed and turned it into a dream.
he's built more than he ever wanted.
how long has this been going on?
it's hard to say now.
at least 00 years, maybe more.
unbelievable.
you see, it takes an extremely brilliant, strong-willed, and emotional personality to achieve that.
and where is mommy in all this?
he was thrown out of these?
you were frozen in time.
your mother is very helpful, very sweet.
isn't that the most important thing in the world?
he has the influence.
the problem is your father's whereabouts in this world depends on your mother's approval.
she's been a happy human being since she was refreshed.
the walls broke apart her two worlds.
and she's brought the fun she's been keeping from her life for years to her daily life.
if your mother doesn't join her, she'll just disappear.
hello, all nice people here.
maybe i'll do some jogging on the bike path.
what do people think if they see you like this?
who cares?
i don't want people calling us old fools.
and don't worry about what people think anymore.
just ignore how a few young people look at what we're wearing.
i'm coming with you, dad.
good boy, good boy.
don't worry about me.
i'm going to newark to pick up some things for the farm.
hey, mom, mom, i told you what the doctor said.
you're supposed to help him now.
your comments won't solve anything.
the guy lives in another time zone.
you gotta show him that.
that's all.
i explained it to you, it's just a dream.
a beautiful and wonderful dream world.
dad's learning how to separate two worlds now.
he's trying.
i don't care what you say.
something happened to her.
this man is not your father.
i think this is the real jake tremont.
he's been hiding it for 00 years.
hello.
i'm jake tremont, and this is bette tremont.
we're your neighbors across the street.
of course.
how can i help you?
okay.
this is christopher.
how you doing, young man?
say hello to mr. and mrs. tremont, chris.
hello.
hello.
if you ever need anyone to take care of a child, we're all home.
oh, you're very kind.
thanks.
no, no, no, it's a lying dog.
that's him.
that's like a lying dog.
yeah.
yeah, he's... he's too fast.
come on...
maybe we should...
we wanted to say hello.
we brought you some cake.
come in.
maybe he's out in a secret.
did you hear any strange noises last night?
why, did you?
i think i heard something.
i think it must be the wind.
close the door
they come with the wind
how's it going with dad?
the doctor thinks it's a fix.
he tries to get into my bed at night.
he won't leave me alone.
your father has always been a sexy man, but since he came back from new jersey, he's insane.
when we first got married, i told my friend fanny hogan the things we did with your father, and he told me to leave him and notify the police.
when i confessed with the priest, he told me he'd pray for me.
but it didn't work.
you know, when your father was warned, what cops, priests, prayers, nothing can stop him.
oh, grow up.
"i'm a small, fat teapot."
♪ here's my handle, my mouth ♪
"when i'm gone"
♪ you'll hear me scream ♪
"shake me down and blow me!"
oh, bingo.
here.
you know, i just realized something.
we don't speak japanese.
you just realized that?
we should try to know a new country one night a week.
we should just eat the food of that country and speak the language of it.
we have to do this.
no, we shouldn't.
"where is the train station?"
"where is the train station?"
what are you doing?
i'm trying to find the train station.
i think that's a good idea.
it's working.
i feel like japanese.
oh, uh, yes, annie, give us some samples, please.
clothes, huh?
"the japanese women's clothes...
"is very different from the men.
"in a region where villagers like husbands...
"...pants and trainers.
"this is a new one coming in,
"...it makes it hard for people to separate the sex from the fact that men have no beards."
i don't know about you, but i don't want to be in a country where i can tell you how sexist people are.
i mean it.
this happened to me earlier in a bar.
john, john, you tell us about the farm.
"in this land of mountains, only 00% of the land can be processed."
pass the rice, please.
if you say that in japanese.
"would you pass the bar, please?"
you're welcome.
come on, mom.
you go on with it.
no.
no.
no.
billy, you-you go ahead.
traditional japanese sports.
what did you prepare for us?
"sumo wrestlers, wearing sumo clothes...
"that they must gain 000 pounds of weight before they repent."
that's a big idea.
make her as fat as you can, and then put her in a diaper.
john, don't you think that's interesting?
mario, i'm starting to worry about you.
honey, please tell me...
wait a minute.
stretch, stretch...
what do you want?
what about the fish?
do you want it?
here.
no, i don't, jake.
i don't eat that.
i don't want to know japanese.
i don't want to know the neighbors' children.
mom, please stop...
i wanted you to walk, but now i know what i have.
but since he got back from the hospital, this place has turned into a madhouse.
costumes, jogging, hours of sex.
and heard-da-in-law in new jersey!
i'm telling you, this man can't be left alone on the street.
dad's really good.
he just wants to have fun!
i didn't live my life to end this way!
a crazy guy like my old friend!
you know better than that.
the doctor said he wasn't crazy!
the fact is, he's been living under your raid for 00 years!
oh, don't.
please don't.
don't say that to your mother.
please.
we're family.
we trust each other.
let's all love and forget each other.
and please don't fight.
this kind of talk kills me.
why?
why are you doing this?
you're gonna get her back to her.
this can't be what you want.
i want my husband back.
he wants his life back.
he loved you for 00 years.
can't you just leave him alone?
i'm scared, jake.
i don't understand who you are.
i don't know you.
i know.
look at me or... or see the old man they see.
but in me, thank god, bette, i feel 00.
and i guess i am, too.
your other life, jake, is giving away the crown.
what's so bad for me?
we passed the border a little.
a little.
you're asking me to go back to our old life?
oh, no.
i'm asking you to live what we want.
you were good.
not just to me, but to the world...
we used to have a good time, remember?
we used to dance all the time.
you were a pretty good dancer.
and i wanted to dance with you one last time before i died.
don't talk about death.
dying is not a sin.
so is life.
morning, mom.
morning.
nice outfit.
your father likes it.
mr. tremont?
i have some news.
not too good.
what is it?
well, that's not the same in every case, but, uh...
okay, good doctor, you can tell me the truth.
cancer's back.
it's spreading.
the lymph glands are infected.
how much?
it's hard to say.
every patient seems different.
dr. chad?
i don't know.
hey, dad, what are you doing up?
i'm waiting for you.
why?
just so you know, your mom and i divorced when you were too young to come home late.
i think i've lost my sense of concern for my son as a father.
you want me to go out and come back?
no, just sit down and we'll talk.
what do you want to talk about?
i'll try to tell you something.
i'd like to give you some advice as your father.
some predictions.
i can't think of anything.
it might be hard for someone your age to understand someone my age.
you know, every time we see each other, it's always on the move.
you go or i come, or we're in somebody's wedding.
all we talk about is the suitcases, the suitcases, the little sandwiches we can eat.
i don't know much about you.
well, uh, look, i'm 0'0",
i like sports, i like bikes-
you know, we always do the same thing.
we come to yan, to say something real and then one of us makes a joke.
talk to me.
tell me about mexico.
i love it there.
ah, there are people in there who are friendly and understanding.
well, life goes into a rhythm there.
do you have many friends there?
yes, there are five of us.
you know, we hang out as a group.
we work together.
we share everything we do.
we share the cleaning, the housework.
we're a real family.
other guys from school, too?
well, two of them are girls.
life changed, billy.
it's hard to believe that life changes.
why is money coming from your mother and me first?
oh.
you said you wanted to talk.
okay.
because, uh, this is about what a man was before.
some fathers wear teams and make good money.
okay, that's easy.
because i love the power of it.
it's nice to have someone... who goes to work and runs for him.
and something should have been given, that was my family.
well, i never did.
i could never get away from my family.
running was the hardest thing that ever happened to me.
that's not what it looked like.
i mean, because we wanted to be normal.
that's what the books say.
normal divorce.
but it hurt.
a little.
it still hurts.
i miss you, billy.
and you never really felt like you needed me around.
but i love staying in your life.
i'm your father.
i have a kiss for you.
someone i feel i owe something.
so what is it?
forgiven.
he slept a little.
you were here all afternoon?
he feels better when i'm here.
let's go downstairs and get something to eat.
the doctor will be here shortly.
i don't want to miss him.
i'll catch up with you.
come on.
where's mom?
he went down to have dinner with billy.
oh, good.
how are you feeling?
perfect.
i'd say nice.
you know what i think?
what?
0000 yankees-dodgers games.
what?
i'm trying, but all i think about is old games and old shows.
bonanza.
oh, that's great, dad.
what about the 0000 yankees-dodgers games?
who took it?
this is the biggest incident in baseball history.
the players are yankee middle field, joe dimaggio, the prince of the game, the stars, and the dodger wings,
al gionfriddo, second row player.
he's just a left-winger...
carl furillo, got hurt.
do you know this story?
tell me.
well, in the sixth game, the subspace hit was 0 to 0 dodgers ahead.
two in, two out.
top dimaggio.
he threw the ball in the left wing, the most famous run ever written.
everyone there knew that.
but that little guy gionfriddo turned up.
he ran after the ball.
but joe dimaggio didn't get the ball shot.
at the last moment, it jumped.
he lived forever.
but the main event is here.
dimaggio started his second tour, and he saw gionfriddo catch the ball.
she was so depressed, she kicked the mud.
you like that?
this man who never showed his feelings, he was a human being.
it was al gionfriddo who showed his feelings.
you know what that means to me?
what is it?
in america, anything is possible if you do your job well.
sometimes when you were a kid, i wanted to take more care of you.
i'd like to kiss you more.
you did it, dad, you did it.
do you know how much i love you?
yeah.
a lot has happened, johnny.
sometimes good, sometimes bad.
honey, i put these in the car.
okay.
did you talk to mom?
mom will stay here for now.
until the middle of next month.
then we'll see.
okay.
i think she'll be fine.
how are you holding up?
i miss him.
yeah, me too.
go ahead, i'll catch up with you.
one moment, please.
you go.
hmm...
grandpa, we wanted to say goodbye before we left.
well, ...and we decided this is the right place to do it.
because there's so much of you here.
you have a living and growing thing.
as for what i think of you...
that was fun.
yeah.
grandpa, i love you and i will always miss you.
my father and i are here together.
that's good.
that's a good idea.
i feel better.
me too.
tobacco and they say it's a mix of black garbage, inviting demons.
he looked at me like he was trying to reveal a mystery to me.
turk came to florence.
but as far as this year's political incident is over, it won't be the same quality parade.
we'll pay half as much for the traditional trade rules now, half when it's done.
tell me, is there nothing else you're afraid of?
please don't help them do this.
but the fact is, i designed a more ambitious series of tools that i know your urine would interest.
speaking of which, a two-headed calf died on zitto's farm.

why don't the guardians give him comfort?
the man's sword was so loose and now he finds himself staring at this beautiful sword.
because if you'd asked people, they'd say i could use both my hands so well and i could fight with both hands so easily.
you made a serious mistake tonight, artcar.
but i'm staying at the black swan's guest house.
come and see me before i go, maestro.
what did he give you?
same butt, very different faces, and when i realized that, i took a sip from her tit.
i'm not gonna let you screw up our family's name with your plane moves and your self-promotions.
as much as i'd like to deny you, our reputation depends on each other.
my wife, margherita, gave me a boy last week.
my legal heir.
i wonder how long it'll take him to curse his blood.
you're a good man.
by men who know how to shoot.
this is what you did, leonardo.
they're executing a jew today.
she's totally attractive, but i'd rather take that toothless witch to bed.
please give me something to drink from the fountain of memory.
depends what's inside.
history is a lie that has been used by people who have suppressed the truth.
centuries later, your story will be suppressed.
have you ever heard of "life is like a river"?
the thing that doesn't make the most sense is that the river is a circulation.
one man's death opens the other's birth door.
i saw a man executed today.
please give me something to drink from the fountain of memory.
this temple was a place where a temple used as a religious belief long before christ.

do you remember when something happened in your childhood?
i was a kid in vinci.
i was on my way to pick up the lost lamb.
what am i supposed to do until then?
fate chose you, leonardo.
i don't believe in fate.
then believe in yourself.
and where do i start looking?
the hanged man and the depth of the soul.
he already opened the door for you.
what about mom?
he'll be waiting for you on the other side.
all you have to do is go through the door.
master!
we've been looking for you since last night.
this place has been empty for centuries, leo.
master, the night guardians were looking for you.
they said lorenzo medici himself wanted you.
leonardo di ser piero...
they said my notary had a bastard son.
i'm also told that you're very incapable of keeping your own ideas, arrogant, arrogant, refreshed.
arrogance means i overestimate myself.
my mistress, lucrezia, seems to think you have a failure to paint.
he insisted only you could paint his beauty.
he must be very careful then.
a character flaws can be called.
you gotta be smart enough to finish this.
when it comes to miss donati, boredom is the last thing i fear.
then i'll tell your father to make a contract.
i have some designs i think might interest you.
that'll increase the shooting of your ballerina at a high level.
when the upper flame will be filled with balls under it, and the underneath it can cool down.
balls are designed in air-conditioning compartment...
the impulse power will be two men inside.
they'll control the manivel so they can turn the wheels around.
balls can be placed in compartment around the car.
it's a flying machine.
it was modeled from the winged wings of a bat.
they were born with wings, yes.
i believe that people can fly, and by giving us the brains that god can imagine it, we are celebrating.
anything that can be imagined can finally be done.
whoever says otherwise is an idiot.
what exactly are you suggesting?
i hope to be hired as army engineer.
i'm a traitor, da vinci.
i had nothing to do with making war.
and rome.
the two states had to build an alliance with the other states.
sforza's death was the end of the game board.
you need your own weapons, sir.
i'll give you a modest salary.
to see what this is all about can be done in reality.
shall we say 000 florins?
if you negotiate any further, i'll cut out your tongue.
whatever you say, sir.
thank you.
you used lucrezia to get to me, didn't you?
i take advantage of everything i can to reach my targets.
clever, but i suggest you not be too smart around me.
is there a problem?
no, sir.
there are no secrets in florence.
what demon did you do this time?
he played with a woman's pride.
then back to work.
we have a columbina to do!
i want you to take the body of the hanged jew.
i have to look into it.
i'm worth it?
your body's up to a good time.
i guess i better get to work.
_
with the intricate francesco and old jacopo.
as is our right.
we were given our horse for what they did in the first crusade.
columbina's about to fly.
welcome, all of you, to the house of god.
the flames of the ankabird looks good on you.
tell me the truth, are you always this passionate about who you're sleeping with?
you're not a whore, ma'am.
there's no point in us going on this game anymore, miss donati.
i knew you were the first time you were close to me.
how did you know?
i drew you.
your face, your pause, your move.
the more intriguing question is why would a noble woman risk her reputation on a naughty artist?
that's the whole carnival thing, isn't it?
then tell me what it is.
so you knew i'd call you.
lorenzo really liked his designs.
can i see some of your miracles?
what's this?
it's a tool to slow down someone's fall rate.
and under what circumstances can i use this?
let's say you're stuck in a castle.
you can relieve this and safely into the air.
thank god.
the attention lorenzo showed you is obviously right.
you risked more.
maybe his life.
what do you care about my reckless attitude?
i'm forbidden fruit, and you think your fate is scratched.
you're the third person in this week who's been telling me about fate.
maybe you just started hearing what they're calling you.
now...
fuck me again, leonardo.
this time, remember, you're not the only one who can manipulate.
for obvious reasons, we can't let you through the front door.
how rude of me.
i promised to pay first.
i admit you're satisfied?
then start talking.
there's a new actress on stage.
leonardo da vinci is a known artist.
the medicis have hired him to build surrounded weapons.
artisans are the clowns of families.
i don't know why this news would interest us.
this artist is different.
my spy in florence.
if i'm not mistaken, you're lupo mercuri.
head of the secret record.
looks like turk found himself a new champion.
keep watching him.
see if he's cooperating.
what if he doesn't?
then da vinci will burn in hell with pain.
with the enemies of god.
don't stiffen up.
yeah, you too.
in a good defense, you have to be moving on the line.
when the bad guy comes at you, you cross the line and create a new line.
until he gets old and dies or until you save me?
angel, i didn't ask you to open a hole in me.
i want to learn to fight.
you don't believe i'm gonna do this.
men aren't always around to protect the women.
besides, what if it was you that i should fight?
that might be it.
okay.
force him to fight back, and he'll increase his speed.
cordelia, using a deadly weapon is a little different than shaking a pong.
ready!
okay!
you're on the team.
lilah.
i was just keeping billy company.
thanks a lot, gavin.
i'll take it from here.
he felt trapped.
gavin, why don't you go hang out with your deals?
you don't wanna wake up in a terrible place again, do you?
no one wants that.
congressman.
i hope you stayed out of trouble this time.
let's go home.
this is the second time you brought our niece back to us.
our pleasure.
"happy for us" means he had nothing to do with it.
good boy.
meanwhile, get out.
why don't you try listening instead of always opening your big mouth and shutting it down?
you weren't captain of the debate team, were you?
at least lindsey...
your attempt to teach you angel is your responsibility.
i'm so proud of you.
never hurts to be ready.
if you think he can help you fight, why not?
i was kidding.
wesley, if you want to get to know fred better, maybe next time, you'll have the chance to have a samimi dinner you'll want us to come over.
so i...
is it that obvious?
i don't think anyone else noticed.
still, the last thing any of us should be doing is mating with each other.
office love, even under normal circumstances...
we don't live under normal circumstances.
what are the odds of us finding someone who can deal with what we have to deal with?
i don't know, maybe we should think...
be with each other?
actually, i was gonna say be alone.
wesley, tell him if you like him.
this murder was committed a week ago.
why are they showing it to me now?
how did you get these?
the police sold you these?
usually, if the victim's important, they sell these.
he said she didn't listen to him.
he was trying to make her stop talking.
actually, it worked.
00:00, check it out 00 minutes before the crime was committed.
what?
okay, he's nice.
and who is he?
are you sure it's him?
when you take one of your size from hell, you remember her face.
yeah, that's him.
now we know why the powers made me see her death.
he's dead because of me.
angel, if he's somehow responsible, then so am i.
angel...
hey.
whatever's happening right now, you're not responsible for it, and neither am i.
but i know who you are.
you seem a little nervous, lilah.
long day at the office.
it was brought to my attention.
i was gonna do it.
i know he has some powers...
billy definitely didn't touch me, and you can't touch him.
this family is the most important family in the country.
they own half the east coast.
the law won't do anything to them.
it's not like you cut some monsters.
stay away from my client.
i don't think stealing bells is too good.
how about sneaking in, dressing up like a security guard?
well, do you want to be next?
i think we should wait here.
why didn't it surprise me that i could get in without being invited?
as far as i know, you have an invitation.
i've never hurt a woman in my life.
i just like to watch.
you're going back.
really?
you're looking for me.
we're putting you in custody for questioning.
sanchez, read him his rights.
who are you?
no one.
i'll tell you what i'm saying, there's a woman who never listens to me.
yeah, giving up $00 million in wealth and running off into a prison cell.
yeah, but for how long?
a very well-protected demon dimension, an impenetrable hellfire, my guess, my guess, would be no problem for a simple obstacle.
angel, what are you gonna do?
you can't just walk into a police station and play terminator.
there was an accident.
he can tell you what billy did to her partner before he attacked her.
i don't think it's a good idea for one of us to wait while we're visiting patients in the hospital.
some of the blood in the car is his.
not human.
he came through here.
i'll take a sample to the hotel, see what kind of creature billy was.
i'll take care of a leg.
normal, daily errands.
cordelia.
i don't think you should do this.
how can i not?
i managed to get a sample of billy's blood.
maybe we can determine which demon he's robbed and how his power works.
could you pass me the glass plates?
thank you.
are you going to invite me in?
please, come in.
i want you to tell me about billy.
tell angel everything you didn't tell him.
what makes you think i'll do that?
your face first.
i can see it right away.
i don't change sides in front of the hardship.
angel feels responsible for this guy because he brought him back from hell.
i feel responsible because he did it to save me.
actually, you're totally responsible for this because you don't feel anything, because you're a dirty bitch.
the ball is expanding.
pink is not fashionable this spring.
billy blim makes people crazy.
then why didn't he impress angel?
others can take hours.
god, i hope angel doesn't start feeling angry.
you really haven't.
i have to find billy.
and i'll help you, why?
do you remember the man you hired to get into my visions?
you know what he was doing to me?
i was cut, torn up, my face shattered, hurt in every second, or will it get worse until i'm dead.
this is relentless.
surely there's nothing you can do to stop it.
that your life could be destroyed by someone else.
and a strong woman who's strong enough would never agree to wear a "unbearless bitch" cover.
where's billy?
i'm a taxi driver for 00 years, i understand why you're doing this.
there's a reason for that, am i right?
how many times do you want to talk to your client with fists?
did he surprise you?
she probably sat back and told him how to drive.
you know the type.
he probably deserved it.
like i said...
dylan, your cousin's here.
hey, dylan.
billy.
i didn't know you were having a party.
i thought we agreed you wouldn't come here anymore after the last thing.
do you want it or should i?
some of the red blood cells seem to be extremely powerful.
that means billy's coming from the demon line.
then it seems billy's power to drive people crazy is in his blood.
which means it could have been through the sweat or spit or even the touch.
speaking of spit, where's cordelia?
i think you knew he was out when you said, 'cause you talked to him.
well... i thought...
if you lie to me again, we'll have a serious problem.
sit down, fred.
there's something we need to talk about.
i'm sorry i didn't tell you cordelia left.
we still have to make some changes around here.
change can be good, i think.
it's like you don't wear the provocative clothes anymore.
provocative?
maybe your mom and dad never told you what men, grown men were up to.
you can't just come in here and wave like that on my face.
you're really forcing me to take him.
is that what you want?
stop it.
are we standing up now?
you grab your hair back, flap your eyes and then when we turn around, you laugh at us.
you think because you're connected to life, you can do anything you want because a place is bleeding?
no.
i'll show you blood.
what do you tell a woman with two black eyes?
nothing you've said twice already.
no sense of humor.
to be honest, i'm calling to kill that bastard.
come in.
you need to know the rules about billy.
everyone in the family knows these rules.
don't leave your girlfriend alone with him, you keep your pet away from him, and you never let him touch you.
when you want money, leave it on the table and get away.
can you explain something to me?
why did you invite me in after you said i wanted to kill your cousin?
you're angel, right?
did billy mention me?
he said an extremely emotional person named angel was coming here later.
melodrama is exaggerated...
fred.
i know what you're doing.
and who you are.
you're shooting me.
you're forcing me to find you.
it's like a cat-fare play.
you fool me with a girl's special way.
but you never give up, do you?
no, you just keep laughing and running.
guess my love, i'm not one of the new lice students.
i'm a man.
you can't show up, can you?
no, you hide.
you cheat.
you and the snake are plotting behind us.
"all right, eat this.
it's just an apple. "
the problem is the sex.
why are you making me do this?
do i know you?
i thought we should meet.
i'm the woman wolfram and hart tortured to get you out of your cell.
i see.
poor, helpless, crushed woman needs to knock out all the unfairness to her.
no, asshole.
i'm here to send you back.
i mean, of course you women are prostitutes who sell themselves for money and charge but men are just as bad.
maybe even worse.
they're willing to spend their careers, their families, or their lives for what's under your skirt.
i'm wearing pants.
i'm actually superior because i got an arrow aiming for an alibi.
and i used a penis-like weapon, coincidence?
i don't think so.
you don't have the guts to do that.
you were wrong again.
he can't hurt me.
no, i'm not gonna hurt her.
i'll never hurt her.
over here.
i can tell you that billy's handprint was damaged.
so the handprint on the downstairs fingerprint is billy's blood?
you're telling me that wes turned out to be a freakin' murderer because of the handprint i took?
it worries me when you put it that way.
i'd better get out of here.
lock the door behind me.
maybe we should use plan b.
jesus.
you said we should follow plan b, but what's plan b?
plan b...
plan b...
plan b, if you don't stop whining, i'm gonna punch you...
jesus.
cordy, get out of here.
all that rage, all that rage, all that hate to get to the surface.
please leave.
i can't.
that's my problem.
you think that's your problem?
you know what your real problem is?
guys like that!
because your power doesn't affect me.
charles, you're scaring me.
take this and knock me out.
you want me to hit you?
yeah!
i can't.
you might want to.
hit me!
charles, please.
"charles, please." fine.
you'll pay for this.
would you like to hear my theory, fred?
about how stupid you are.
after living in a cave for five years, i believe you're instinctively small, dark places, instead of fleeing safe.
let's get this over with.
i'm sorry, wesley.
are you sorry?
you were right about me loving dark places to hide.
but you forgot i also like to develop things.
i don't understand either.
i mean, you're a man, but why didn't billy's touch affect you?
maybe because i'm not human.
and a vampire can never turn into a monster.
you know that stuff billy makes out in other people?
it was always for pain and pleasure.
i think you could say your evil way makes you less important than humans.
he seems noble.
i mean, it's really annoying to be inclined to evil.
strange.
what is it?
i'm getting used to fighting outside and relaxing at the same time.
i understand that.
wesley, it's me, fred.
does it hurt?
i left you a lot of messages.
i'm so sorry.
wesley, you need to get back to work.
how can you not come?
but it's time to go back.
fred.
something inside me was forced to the surface.
oh, god, no.
that wasn't something in you, wesley.
it was done to you.
i don't know what kind of man i am anymore.
i know.
you're a good man.
will i see you back at the office?
yeah.
good.
why would he risk everything to avoid compassionate arms?
tomorrow we walk to rome with crixus.
but i want you to go with spartacus.
one fucking bunny?
get the torch here!
his orders are known for strangulation.
eagle and dolphin.
the stamp of gnaeus pumpius magnus.
i thought pumpy was hit by the renegade harshori.
if pumpy's scouts return to the republic, her and the legions will follow their trail.
let me know if you see movement next door.
then we must support the ghost and see the flesh through the bone and light.
was the end like he always dreamed?
the day after we were apart, the glory was full of glory.
the blood of our enemies turned the paths full of dead, into red land.
did he have the same fate as crixus?
to show spartacus the end of his life.
crassus tempts to manipulate and manipulate you.
if i was only responsible for my own life, maybe i'd fall into the trap.
he was heading south towards crassus' legions.
order apollo to leave the camp as soon as he gets near the sky.
a whore named canthara was beaten and found stabbed to death with a knife in her womb.
i'm surprised by this offer.
i don't know that pumpy has the support of a case that doesn't help himself.
if there was such a desire, then why didn't he?
i won't risk going to your commander's camp.
and i will not leave my duty to salute in front of an imaginary tit.
you really can't be thinking of accepting this offer.
pumpy wants to know what he knows about spartacus so he can steal the victory.
and when the time comes, we can get revenge for the injured.
let's make it to ourselves with the theme of living flesh.
and give comfort to the ones left of death, of course.
each drop of roman blood will fall in honor of those taken from us!
i have a professor charles epppes here with me right now, a corsci who often consulted for the fbi.
are you here to help the fbi find bonnie parks?
for instance, we know mrs. parks' car was found in san marino mall.
yes, i calculated 00 companies and people who were going to go after him for revenge.
yeah, that's true, but every suspect was a different level of impulse.
you know that circus game where you put the balloon in the mouth of a clown.
an asymmetric threat assessment allows us to measure the factor that feeds impulses in every suspect, like a game of water calculating water into every clown's mouth.
we need to find out that the unsub has the urge to feed to the point that he feeds on.
especially those who fear him, who fear him.
filter pump has been making a lot of noise lately.
hello, charlie.
your father talked about the class the other day, volunteering.
make it worth your while and on your planet.
it's a closed box during research.
he used to work on his own until the check.
i was in a bedroom with some of them in afghanistan.
he doesn't trust his security.
i'll go by myself.
the lab team broke the notes we found at her office.
your wife, your ex-wife, your angry boyfriend.
yeah, i'm on my way right now.
charlie, who might have tried to do this to you?
because you were already so angry about my interview.
what happened shouldn't change anything.
it was december.
can we meet in the room and not here?
helal to you.
you and mom sacrificed so much to get him to do something big, you know.
i started this job at 00 by swinging a hammer.
it makes taylor look like a big hero to make a rotten return center.
he was forced out of their homes to make room for the website, and he usually talks to the losers that taylor's thugs are scared.
i'm still working on it.
that's the trouble with knowing what i'm analyzing.
i told your father i'd make a shot.
and how cute is it to see the electric meter turn up?
it is, isn't it?
i don't know how long that'll last.
now that you're back, you're either very brave or very small.
i got sonny layva.
when i find bonnie she'll mark sonny.
there's no way that sonny's gonna be kidnapped alone.
when i was being held on that freighter, when they handcuffed me, lancer had something that kept me going.
he knew my team would come for me.
no matter how bad things were, you were working with david, megan and don, and you were going to come through that door.
because i went through the same thing when i first saw war in afghanistan.
yeah, ten-digit property tricks, tricks, tricks, tricks, they're all covered up.
if you draw strength in a certain float, if you pull it down, that float will squeeze them down to civilians on the neighbourhood.
at the same time, the neighbors help lift up the weighted buoy.
basically, it was enough to sink the entire line into the water.
he'd make millions buying property.
hundreds of millions, probably.
we never know.
so is this.
it's nothing but a personal vendetta.
it's not just the walls and the roof dirt.
besides, all that master architecture spirit was a belief that beauty and practice were the same.
behind you.
i mean, do you think i'm a burden to you?
you know, being better.
what exactly are you doing?
nobody likes french.
we've lost contact with our lead exploration troops.
but based on the analysis of the cancer, we know that that's where the microchip began to spread.
we won't know until we see a sample.
you're gonna go down there with special forces, find any survivors, find a blood sample from the dead, but not before the sea missiles destroy the entire area at 00:00.
i don't need to tell you what will happen if 00 minutes gets the story.
what's that smell?
we did it.
the attempt to stop the living dead is overwhelming.
mom!
megan.
you can't fly, baby.
mom!
mr. edick.
what are you doing here?
we need to talk, janet.
can we do this another time?
i wanted to take care of my daughter...
you're not answering my phones.
that's why i came to see you.
no flying.
how can you find me and find my husband in the middle of san francisco?
your husband doesn't want to be found.
i told you that.
yeah, i told you i'd give you all i can.
that's not how it works, janet.
maybe it didn't work that way because my husband paid you.
understand?
yeah.
megan?
megan?
megan?
megan?
megan, come in!
mom?
mom?
mom?
megan.
megan?
hello?
please!
please.
i just want to see my little girl.
please.
please.
at least tell me if he's okay.
no nails.
help!
somebody help me!
please.
can you hear me?
i know you're there.
okay.
stay back!
control yourself!
i won't hurt you.
i'm here to help.
who are you?
my name is joe.
okay?
i'm not one of them.
i don't know.
i woke up five minutes ago.
how did you get out of your room?
there was a key.
you don't have a key?
calm down.
do you know why you're here?
why would anyone do that?
i owed some people money.
how much?
about $0,000.
that doesn't seem worth the trouble.
anyone else?
my husband.
what would your husband want with me?
where are we?
i don't know.
what's the last thing you remember?
i was in the park and...
where?
in san francisco.
i was in new york.
let me see.
i'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
suck your blood.
i think i heard other people.
yeah, me too.
we have to find them.
yeah?
yeah.
what's the matter?
what if it's the people who kidnapped us?
what difference does it make?
we let them go.
of course i can give you a ride.
hello?
can anyone hear me?
hello?
sound!
what is this place?
for god's sake, let me out!
listen to me.
okay, there's a bible in the dresser.
a key in the bible.
look at the bible in the drawer next to your bed.
charlie morse.
capital investor.
i'm joe.
it's not over.
if they want money, i have it.
we're still trying to figure out who they are.
can you help me?
didn't i hear the wake-up call?
easy, easy!
calm down, soldier.
we're on your side.
are you being held hostage, too?
yeah.
we're all hostages.
it's okay.
i didn't think i had that much to drink.
are you okay?
i think it's a slip in my standards.
do you know where he is?
do you know what happened?
i think i should make a call.
come.
where are the people who kidnapped us?
i won't wait to find out.
it's not working.
why don't they come and get us?
i don't understand.
this behavior is contagious, sir!
you must use your strength to balance.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
i just...
my wife.
if i don't look at him, he...
i don't even want to think about what's gonna happ
smoke detector.
if the alarm goes off, the magnets can shut down.
what are you saying?
i mean, if we could light a fire, maybe we could get out of here.
but if the doors don't open, we're stuck here.
anybody got a match?
break as small as you can.
it's a splinter.
this is bullshit.
i want him thrown out and in the throat of the arrow.
renbe, i can't wait to find out.
i need more approval.
is that who i think it is?
better.
you see this?
a missing person in the playground yesterday.
something small enough not to interest us.
it was a mother they missed.
they didn't touch the boy.
a mother who abandoned her child.
no, just a mom.
a good mother.
she was at home taking care of the kids.
that sounds...
if that was gonna happen, it could be in san francisco.
i found an image.
of course you did.
i'm not talking to assumptions, kat.
cops don't ignore evidence like they used to.
security camera caught everything.
internet nets don't get a couple more hours.
vague.
not vague.
it's just hope.
who asked about her?
she has a grandmother, but...
you're looking at me.
i'm looking at you.
your missing mom's gonna have a body bag, mark.
you know that.
let me know the transvestite first.
then you can check out the missing mom thing.
i can't see anything.
everybody think.
what was the last thing you remember?
last night, i went to sleep like every night, and then i woke up here.
who could have done this?
what's your value?
value?
i'm mediating in case you find out.
i make $00,000 a year.
i have $00,000.
you soldier?
the army won't pay much, sir.
what about you?
i have no value but myself.
maybe there is, maybe not.
why do you think they kidnapped you?
i'd rather not.
what do you do?
no offense, but i don't know who you people are.
we're sitting here thinking about where the bad guys are.
how do we know the bad guys aren't here?
he's right.
one of us might be one of them.
but there's only one joe we know nothing about.
everyone has value in someone's eyes.
i don't have the money, i don't have a family.
i have no value in anyone's eyes.
maybe life is because of insurance.
no.
it's the only reason i know how to kidnap someone.
not everyone is kidnapped for money.
right, sergeant?
you're saying someone's gonna cut our heads off?
it's hard to do that if we move.
come on, come on.
there you go.
somebody get that table over there.
here.
come on.
move!
move!
are you coming?
what is this?
a hotel.
chinese food?
someone's been here.
hello?
cut.
hello?
all lines are cut.
i don't understand.
no sheriff's office?
i wonder who's watching us.
i wish they'd come get us.
this is way worse.
we have a few hours before dark.
shall we walk?
until someone stops us.
is this a gun locker?
nobody move!
what?
what do you want us to do?
stay down, okay?
do as he says.
get down!
okay, which one of you is in charge?
you're in charge, right?
you're not one of them, are you?
so you're not one of them.
ma'am, i don't even know who they are, okay?
listen.
we were kidnapped just like you.
i don't know about that.
get down, okay?
i won't tell you again!
if you want to shoot me, go ahead.
i have nothing to lose.
okay?
get the gun!
get the gun!
get the gun!
hold him down.
okay, okay.
i'm not quitting until i get some answers.
what's your name?
how do we get out of here?
i don't know.
red lights, anyway.
i woke up in that hotel across the street.
it was you.
i heard you passed by my room.
you wanted help?
you're telling me you left him then?
look, no offense.
enough.
so what do we do with him?
does it matter?
could be one of them.
okay.
who's coming with me?
me.
what else?
we don't know what's out there.
what, stay here?
i'm just saying that we should be careful.
wait until dark.
then i'll take the rifle and find out.
what if you get caught in the dark?
i risk it.
well, that's your job, isn't it?
but then you'll be dead with the only rifle we have.
if that's what you think it is...
i don't expect darkness.
eve, i'm leaving right now.
you can stay here and watch the others.
who authorized that?
you did.
if i'm not back by tomorrow, you'll find out.
i'll get help.
no, no.
please don't go.
i have to.
were you in the army, joe?
me?
are you kidding?
where'd you get an idea like that?
what you said.
things you know like the way you communicate with that soldier.
what business is that?
janet, your daughter is probably very good.
my daughter is 0 years old, okay?
he has a allergic personality and a special fast one to do.
well, what if something happened to you here...
okay, well, if anything happens to you, you have a family, right?
i mean, your life can't seem to be waiting.
who's waiting for you at home?
exactly.
there's no one to wait.
joe?
joe, can you hear me?
what happened?
wait a minute!
we can't leave them to die.
we can't leave anyone behind, but there's a way to do it, there's a exhaustion.
okay.
okay.
do you think they got shot?
i didn't hear anything.
i don't see any blood.
there should be so much blood.
i'm coming.
if i get shot, you need to find out where the shot was fired.
okay.
mcnair!
this obviously is not working.
we have to go back.
get in!
get in!
let's go inside.
do you remember the last time you saw your daughter?
not any time soon.
we've both been so busy.
she had babysitting jobs, so i...
to be honest, my daughter and i weren't talking.
the truth is, she wasn't talking to me.
until recently, he took me out of his life completely.
i never even met her husband.
he thought megan should know her grandmother.
she never thought i was a good parent.
he said i was being mean.
but i never hit him.
once.
i hit him with a hairbrush until it broke.
my daughter and i...
you see, both of us have strong will.
i found this in your room.
no.
no, it's not mine.
then whose is it?
thank you, grandma.
i look forward to her coming home to show mom.
yes, i'm sure he'll be very pleased.
now take your baby upstairs and play with her.
i need to talk to mr. renbe.
come on.
come on.
if there's anything good about this, it's that i won a second chance.
a chance to be a good parent is what i can't be.
yeah, it's definitely a blessing.
thank you for your time, ma'am.
and don't worry about your daughter.
i'm sure he'll be back soon.
i'm sure everything will turn out fine.
supermarket's empty.
what about the others?
they're still lying there.
someone just passed.
yes, it could be anyone.
you gotta be kidding me.
oh, my god.
okay.
okay.
do you speak english?
i broke my eye, and then i woke up in that van.
it was like...
have you ever used demerol?
do as i say.
you heard me.
take off your shirt.
come on.
excuse me?
you heard me.
do as i say.
if you were drugged, there must be traces.
take off your pants.
hey, moira.
how about you and joe go into a room?
yeah.
look at that.
what the hell is that?
put your clothes on.
all right, everybody, pants off.
okay.
all right, watch your eyes, perv.
we all do.
if i'm not mistaken, this is vaccine.
biometric lovers.
they're used to practice long-term medication, and they can be controlled remote.
great.
i think we all have a lot of sedatives.
you know a lot about this.
my life, on medication.
can you get them out?
they seem very deep.
even if we had the tools to turn it on and off...
food.
come.
please.
eat.
have a seat.
please.
take us to your leader!
we'll come and cook.
we're not responsible.
hands up!
now!
what are you doing?
we're getting some answers.
please!
we're not responsible.
we'll find out soon enough, won't we?
please.
please.
we have to do something.
i agree, but not this.
please.
please.
please.
here you go.
here you go.
please sit down.
here you go.
please sit down.
we'll bring food.
please.
any food?
how are you?
best chinese food i've ever eaten.
i can eat it every day.
what if they kidnapped her too?
what if my daughter is in a place like this?
don't think like that.
you don't understand.
i wish they'd kidnapped him, too.
then at least i knew you were safe.
thank you.
you have to let the decision go.
"your wife is waiting for you."
no one else...
"your judgment is a bit overwhelming."
"you'll soon win a big prize."
"you help someone by helping yourself."
mine's chinese.
moira?
mine only has numbers.
that's weird.
janet?
what?
what does yours say?
just...
_
an irish fortune cookie?
are there any other married men here?
she turned that thing.
you can't think it's for you.
so don't hurt yourself.
did you like the food?
who are you?
i'm the night manager.
at night.
is that gun loaded?
how long have you been working here?
i started last night.
then you must have seen who brought us.
excuse me, ma'am, but you were already checked in when i started.
yesterday's records.
it says we checked in at 0:00 p.m.
yes, it is, ma'am.
excuse me, sir.
can i see your knife?
great.
here.
now listen.
we've had a very long, very weird day.
at your service, sir.
what does he want to know...
where are we?
i'm afraid i don't know.
that's not an answer.
okay, charlie.
where did you come from?
behind the hotel.
i think he meant before.
a guy called and said i'd start work the next day.
and that doesn't seem weird to you?
i'm in.
take a good look.
look closely, ladies and gentlemen.
i used to be like this.
see?
and now look.
now look.
it may seem impossible, it's me.
this is me, ladies and gentlemen!
and you ask yourself, how did he do it?
kiloaway!
how did he do it?
kiloaway!
and you think at home, this guy is here to sell us kiloaway.
this man is here to tell you how wonderful he is.
wrong.
i'm not here to sell you kiloaway.
i'm not here to talk about kiloaway.
ladies and gentlemen, i will not do this.
my name is enrique fresan, and i'm a nutritionist.
i'm here to tell you two steps.
let's start with step 0.
bingo!
ladies and gentlemen, we have bingom.
so this round ends.
this is me, ladies and gentlemen!
and you ask yourself,
how did he do it?
kiloaway!
what are you on now, later?
you don't fit.
here we go.
smile for me.
come on, smile.
fucking fraud.
i don't treat people who want to lose weight, i treat people who want to find the cause of their obesity.
this is the only way to lose weight and stay away from him.
i won't put you on a diet.
eat anything you want.
no more time, no more frustration.
you must find your own way, without hurrying.
the key shows up with a plan so we can help each other.
we'll ask each other questions and search for answers inside ourselves.
in short, we'll expose ourselves.
let's get started.
i want you all to stand up and take off your clothes.
no one should be ashamed.
then you better split up.
honey, come on.
let's go.
i like being fat and naked.
like you're mayo models...
honey, please, let's go.
this must be a cult...
be quiet.
i'm not fat, i'm too fat.
i weighed 00 pounds four months ago.
then i started getting weight.
one, two, three kilos...
a little diet and exercise and they disappear.
0, 0, 0, 0, 00...
it always works.
00, 00, 00, 00... 00... 00.
twenty kilos.
i've had a sleep-deprived problem since i was ten years old, you know, making things, especially during dinner.
me too.
i use sleeping pills because if i wake up at night i start eating.
sofia, what are you doing?
what?
you should go and let him stay.
you're not even fat.
i told you not to come.
you insisted.
and i'm glad i did.
come on, move.
jesus!
what a pain!
okay, we can start now.
let's get dressed.
what are you doing?
paula!
what are you doing?
we can see it like that.
to see her or to control her?
to check.
what if we need some privacy?
privacy or sex?
we can hang the duck.
we need to soundproof it because it's too loud.
wait, don't tire yourself.
no, i want to finish it!
no tires or sex.
i'll do all the work, you can rest.
apple.
how's the new band?
did you take your clothes off?
you said you wouldn't.
yeah, but i did my speech and i kept going...
and now you're horny and want to fuck.
eh, more or less.
i don't know about you, but i'm going back.
i think we should talk about gleaning.
if you already know, it answers the question.
and not telling your parents about it should give you a tip.
alex, i'm sick of this.
you're such a rebel, sofi.
we haven't even seen each other naked yet.
it's time.
when, on our wedding night?
what if you suddenly don't like me?
we saw each other in salou last summer.
it's not the same thing.
same thing.
so let's do it now.
yeah.
your family will be here soon.
then we better hurry.
let me get this button off.
come on.
what do i have to say to give you up?
i'll do it anyway.
you never listen to me.
sofia, no...
i don't understand anything.
suddenly you're worried about your physical appearance.
this can't go on.
you don't belong to yourself." corgians, 0-00.
romans, 000.
your turn.
the lady wants to see me?
do you want to see it?
you'll see.
here.
no.
all of it.
this isa scares me.
it's too small and shriveled.
so you don't love me.
not that, i'm just nervous.
yeah.
i really don't know...
understand, soji?
some things are wrong in the eyes of god.
grandpa desdero...
my grandfather vicente...
my uncle paco...
my father emilio...
my brother fede.
and all of them died from an obesity-made disease before they were 00.
i can't even see my dick when i pee.
i saw it and it seemed fine.
very well.
every inch, every inch, every inch!
copying files...
what are you doing with my phone?
i'll give it back, fat ass.
give it to me.
get out.
give me that.
careful, you're too fat, you can have a heart attack!
you're so selfish!
stop!
what's going on here?
this selfish bitch won't let me use her phone.
ask nicely.
if you want your phone, please.
can i use your cell phone, you fat fucking sea twin sister?
you need to chew on my body, you little fraud.
good.
communication comes first.
contact problem
that's how my partner fucked up my life.
don't think, do as i say!
because you're a pain in the ass, asshole.
it's you, a pest that doesn't just disappear!
a sewer rat!
idiot!
where are you going?
my pictures went out in a couple of magazines, on tv... and sales were down.
it'll cost you 0,000 euros a whole night.
0000 uero?
i'll show you what's worth.
how about a signed poster?
i had more pictures in magazines, and i got fatter, ate more, and more worried.
and more and more...
that was enough, my partner sued me and made me freeze all my accounts as a precautionary measure.
are the pills working?
they can't affect your mood.
it's not my fault you're fat, asshole!
they deserve daily energy.
and the others?
how does being fat affect you at your job?
i knew a new perfume brand at a mall.
but you'd think i was selling poison instead of perfume...
sofia, how can i help you?
now i'm working on a marketing job at a big company.
sofia, how can i help you?
i'm too fat to chase bad guys, so i'm looking at dead guys.
one night, i was always looking for a body in casa isaac, a expensive restaurant that i wanted to go to.
the ring was stuck in his throat and drowned to death.
the waiter heimlich took it, but it was too late when the ring came out.
there was an article in the ring i couldn't read.
i was curious, and i licked it off by licking it.
i did it without thinking.
reflex.
the problem is, i like it.
he was tasting fresh oysters and gala wine.
i was wondering, what was the article?
"i'll love you even in the barn."
fit.
how does being fat affect you at your job?
i work at home, so it doesn't.
i'm writing web-totons and systems codes.
let me get this straight.
my boyfriend's an engineer too.
we used to go to the gym, eat healthy food, we'd be together in the morning...
he doesn't know the situation and i won't tell him.
a telecometer without a webcam?
i didn't want to buy one.
why don't you tell him and get out?
how about you help me lose 00 pounds?
when is he coming back?
in 0 months.
don't worry, if he's in america, he'll be fat like a pig.
is it working?
no, just a minute.
then come over and get some special treatment for you.
did you go to him later?
no, i didn't.
maybe you should go.
it's not just about saving ourselves.
it's about saving others, or at least trying.
i'll go if i have to.
don't you trust alex?
but i don't like him looking at naked women.
maybe that's why she doesn't want to see me naked.
sofia, please...
there are more effective ways to get to know each other.
why is everything about sex bad or wrong?
you just have to wait for the right time, the right reason and the right place.
while you're at it, tell them about the scan you joined.
they do strange things.
come on!
it's always the same.
hey, show some team spirit.
00-00, set points for blue team.
come on, you're sleeping there!
yeah, let him go!
he didn't eat well.
i disagree.
fine.
samuel, your service.
come on, get that fat ass over here!
luis, one more joke and i'll leave you out of this class.
let's go!
you fatso.
i'd hit you, but i don't want my hands to be pork.
throw it over here, come on.
when you're bored?
under stress?
when you're satisfied?
i mean, all day.
i have a cupcake, another cupcake, i switch to chocolate, another cupcake, then i have lunch, first course, second course, dessert, a snack, then dinner, and just before bedtime a tiny piece of chocolate.
isn't that what everybody expects from me?
"look, it's fat again."
i was... guilty.
i found an effective method to deal with this.
sharing.
so you make people fatter around you.
no, it's not that...
one for you, one for me.
come on, honey, eat up.
this is your birthday cake.
it's breaking the routine.
you sick fuck!
you two are really unbearable today.
it's gift time.
this is for you, and this is yours.
a laptop...
what is this thing?
it's an automated artery to analyse dna samples.
you can be like my father.
it was broken, so i fixed it for you.
that's stupid!
don't be so ungrateful.
we got you this because we knew you wouldn't love him.
you put the electrodes in your body, and it's getting fucked up.
if there was a zillion electrodes, it was good.
cell phone!
she's got her camera and everything, you don't bother her sister.
megapixel is higher than yours, big ass.
eat up, honey.
then use your body shape-shifter and it's done.
guess where i am.
i'm getting on the plane.
where?
teo, teo!
teo, come here!
teo!
teo, come!
teo!
teo, honey.
you see this?
amniotic sacrifice is exhausted.
you could lose the baby.
what should i do?
paula, what do you think about spending the rest of your pregnancy in bed?
wait...
ready?
one, two... and three.
what is it?
the bed of latex.
a present from my mother.
it's not a bed, it's two mattresses
no, look.
you put these zippers and two together.
of course, you don't know that... or your mother.
don't start with mom again.
you really...
you want someone else?
that's quite comfortable.
and we'll fit in one meter.
you weren't excited at the sex shop the other day, were you?
no.
you're the only one i love.
i'm scared.
why?
you can get bored with me.
that doesn't mean anything.
it means i love you more than anything.
i'm ugly, fat and gross.
i don't believe you, i don't...
how can i prove it?
you're not touching me.
touching.
what am i doing now?
it's not touching.
but it is!
it's not touching, alex.
that's touching.
and ibrahim said:
creation,
chapter 00.
the right moment, the right reason, and the right place.
don't film me!
run, fatso, run.
go ahead.
what do you want?
you don't have to sue me for that.
i've never seen you run before this case.
it's obvious you need some push.
you're an asshole and you'll never hurt me.
then get lost, snot.
i sold the penthouse.
you sold my penthouse?
you have a week to move out.
son of a bitch!
i'm not moving, understand?
what are you doing?
don't try to trick me.
get up, there's people around.
jesus...
help!
help me...
are you relieved now?
well, yeah, i don't know.
shall we do it again?
sin is already done.
right.
maybe this time you'll last long enough to bring it in.
we need protection for that.
the bed is packed.
it won't get stained.
alex...
that's not what i mean.
if we do this, we face the consequences.
okay.
you had a little angina.
you just panicked.
what about the other guy?
you know him?
my partner.
trauma to the skull.
it triggered an aneurysm and severe heart failure.
we've managed to stabilize him, but he's probably brain damage.
enrique...
oh, jesus!
jesus!
what happened to him, enrique?
i'm going to die!
what did they do to him?
do it now.
be brave enough to do that.
i know you're gonna leave me.
because i'm fat.
because you won't want to be with someone as fat as i am.
because you always hated fat people.
so i want you to leave me now.
don't touch me.
stop.
stop!
i haven't left the house in 0 months.
all i do is work and eat.
i have no life without german.
i can't do anything without him.
you can't spend your whole life with a man.
i didn't try anything different, i didn't, i didn't.
i feel like i've been missing out on my life for 00 years.
i got fat because i wanted him to leave me.
leave me, leave me, go!
i went for a run and my partner came to cheer me up.
suddenly i heard a sound, and a man was fighting with my partner.
i thought you were robbing him.
she pushed him and ran.
i tried to call for help, but... obviously my heart couldn't take it.
did you see the man who robbed him?
no.
it was so dark.
did your partner have any problems?
no.
last question.
you're the kiloaway guy, right?
kiloaway rules!
kiloaway rules!
kiloaway rules!
kiloaway rules!
kiloaway!
kiloaway!
kiloaway!
look at you, please.
in the privacy of your homes, in front of the mirror.
if your answer is yes, forget what doctors and society say.
stop feeling bad.
forget my method, forget my kiloaway pills.
let's move on to step 0.
step two:
it's not important to lose weight, it's how you feel.
describe yourself with a word.
light.
happy.
terrible.
let's see if your feelings are connected to your weight.
00 kilos lighter.
i beat the festival nun.
looks like sofia's the only one who's connected with weight loss.
why do you think you lost weight?
i don't know, i've been more active these last few months.
i have a purpose and motivation.
but i think it's really because i'm more satisfied spiritually.
much more.
i've set the water cooler, it's good for your heart.
you can't believe the fuss the neighbors made for rampa.
we must support each other in this life.
i put your clothes in the closet.
i was tired of seeing them all around.
disaster!
i'll be right back.
what's this?
i checked every test personally.
i can't believe it either.
what happened?
eat shit, fat ass!
i failed one less than you!
asshole.
you're not out of one body training class.
this teacher must really love you.
paula, what's wrong?
i don't fit in my pants.
if you know they won't be yours, why are you wearing them?
they used to be, and i wanted to look nice to you.
you look amazing.
i'm gonna break this fucking mirror.
you've been staring at yourself all day...
look at my tits, they're huge!
they're beautiful.
you don't like big tits.
don't lie to me.
i'm so scared.
listen to me for a second.
paula, i'm not sick of you.
you're sick of yourself.
how many six months pregnant women who seem better than that?
all of them.
they all say how wonderful pregnancy is.
that's not what i expected.
you can't go on like this.
this is insane.
i know.
you didn't invite anyone?
put something on.
i told my parents i wanted a private lesson.
i can't stand being home or school.
i can't stand being anywhere.
you're the only one who's been nice to me and has a bigger belly.
you can't move, can you?
i can do your shopping, keep you company, do some cleaning...
you want asylum?
a little.
take your homework off.
how's the new p.e. teacher?
what a jerk.
he makes us run non-stop.
but like i did, i'm just walking.
i keep it in hand in case my blood sugar drops.
in case your blood sugar drops?
give it to me.
open the book.
give me the candy.
open the book.
is it fixed?
yeah, all right.
if it breaks down again, i'll break it in your head.
_
erika...
hey, honey.
how was work?
fine.
he was staring at his ass.
who, carlos?
i'm so excited!
i don't find it funny.
you're jealous.
no.
do you think that's true?
would you like me to look at other girls?
you wouldn't like it, would you?
i don't think it's funny.
because i'm not well.
all i can think about is having sex with you.
again and again.
i see you dress like this and...
by the way, we can stop by the house.
did they bring more furniture?
we're sex addicts.
no, we're love addicts.
pilar...
we should start sleeping apart.
i can't sleep apart, i'm scared.
fine, but i have to go and find a new apartment.
find someone to stay and take care of you.
pilar!
the doctor said i was good enough to continue living normal.
what's wrong?
you're my partner's wife.
we can't play happy couple.
fine, but you're gay.
you'll be fine.
besides, we were friends before i met jesus.
do you remember when we slept together in college?
it was awful!
i was sure i was gay that day.
jesus hasn't been with me for 00 months.
i guess he was a little gay too.
pilar, no.
i'm horny.
close your eyes and think i'm a man.
no!
like one of those sexy kids you fuck 000 euros with.
let's see what happens.
use your teeth.
that's it, gently, careful...
until he leans in and gives me a blowjob.
did you become an erekon?
how was it?
blow jobs blowjob.
you'll enjoy this experience as much as i did.
what about him?
did you do something to her?
like what?
like he did to you.
no, gross!
one question, mr. therapist.
isn't it a little unusual for you to talk about personal matters in the bar?
a beer can reveal things that don't come out alone in therapy.
like your straight relationships.
it really pisses me off, senora.
he's always talking about happy and cupcakes and another cupcake and another cupcake...
what a pain!
i think i just saw leonor go out.
i swear it was him.
another one!
what happened to the greedy manager?
i don't know.
he came to the wrong group one day.
sorry, i think i came at the wrong time.
not the wrong time, it was the wrong day.
and he never came back.
i called, but he didn't answer.
and then he sent a message saying he'd left.
who wants potato chips?
go get one.
what was our deal?
i'm just suggesting potato chips.
if he gets it, i get it.
i feel guilty when i eat alone.
you told us to stop blaming ourselves.
it's one thing to give up, putting it on someone else's back.
give me the fucking chip!
no more guilt.
feel better?
much better.
how much more pizza are we going to look at?
all i can get is a cold pizza.
"i'm a fat, pushed out of society, i can eat anything i like."
i don't want to listen to this anymore, do you understand?
your excuse is ready.
yes, it is.
what's this?
it's a field trip to school.
you never sold it.
i don't go to a party or travel.
samuel isn't going?
i don't think so.
too bad, it looks good.
come on, like my dad said.
one for you, one for me and everybody's happy.
okay.
you're right, only the fatest kid in class can like me.
fat couple, how nice.
"nice." do you like him?
incompetent, ridiculous, inexcusable, pathetic...
great.
you send him a message, you can eat a slice.
no 0 slices, no deal.
i'll have my 0 slices and candy from your bag.
there's no candy in my bag.
okay, okay.
not the big one, the small one.
you're not eating?
i don't eat snacks.
you never mentioned him.
he learns spanish and becomes a good christian.
he'll sing us a religious song from his country.
okay?
come on, champ.
i name my friend sofia the song.
so marry me.
how cute.
imagine us walking down this hall to the altar.
no, we'll get a proper choir.
the choir can make good funds.
if you don't let me have the beard, you can forget this music.
like tarzan.
spoiled.
okay, therapist.
are you sure you don't want to close your eyes and go with the flow?
no, this is not ethical because i'm your therapist.
then goodbye.
can i have another beer?
you brought your boyfriend.
he's not my boyfriend, jerk.
he told me he was crazy about you.
i just talked to her, she said you were great.
i hate alcohol.
relax, grab a job.
come on!
i hate alcohol too.
hi.
pilar, what are you doing here?
the pills don't work without you by my side.
you don't belong here.
why?
i can help you, idiot.
there are less busy ways.
don't pay.
why would you pay for sex?
you can't have someone who really loves you.
i don't want to love anyone, do you understand?
for not finding the right person.
i'm not the right person for anyone, pilar.
come on.
pilar, i'm gay, okay?
i like men, don't you understand?
go away!
go!
why?
i can't hear you.
i pretended to sleep when you came home late and you fucked me anyway.
yeah, i remember.
i spoke with my gynecologist today.
you know, normal life.
okay.
i'll have something to do tomorrow.
relax, i'll be right in.
you want me to fall asleep.
i want you to come to bed with me.
and i'm telling you i'll clean up first.
paula?
don't yours help you deal with your brother?
mine only think of themselves and their perfect marriage.
all they do is fuck all day long.
yuck!
you have to learn to protect yourself.
i found unpleasant rat poison on the internet.
paula, if she stays, i'll sleep on the couch.
you'll sleep on every couch.
come on, put it away.
one for you...
come on.
and one for me.
it tastes good, doesn't it?
even when i was a kid, i felt different.
i didn't like girls playing football or playing like that.
because if you're fat and fat, no one'll ask you why you're not acting like the others.
no one would notice i was gay.
but i didn't turn myself in until the special olympics in '00.
they let me volunteer, miraculously,
and they gave me to the swimmers.
there was an incredibly handsome australian who hired me to get her out of the pool because she didn't have legs.
i don't know which made me happier, that he smiled at the wheelchair when he got the bronze medal or that he took my virginity.
my first joke was a barrier.
i'm sick of being gay.
really.
we're expected to be emotional, happy, full of life, tolerant.
the first of humanity.
and that's not me.
i can't wait all night for muzice.
go.
you have to pay all kinds.
i'm a fraud.
i'm the worst faggot of all time.
i'm a lying, mean, cruel bumper.
i'm a contradiction.
contradictions aren't supposed to be bad.
they can always be explained by something we're not ready to face.
so it's better not to run from them, but to face them and see where they lead us.
because most contradictions form the answers we seek.
put your hands on your stomach.
close your eyes.
let's all breathe together.
inhale...
breathe, breathe.
i thought it was my pregnancy, but it was me.
we all have contradictions.
it's the first step in which we need to understand what we want or don't want in our lives.
who limit you but worship you?
i broke the machine on purpose so i could go back there.
i broke it.
the one you prayed for, but repressed?
that you're suppressing, but freeing you?
the one who set you free, but who jumps?
the one who trashed you and loved you?
what is it you refuse, but you love?
are you doing this because you want to or because you want to pretend everything's fine?
society wants you to be fat.
if you're fat, everybody feels better because they feel superior.
not anymore.
now it's time to take the first step.
hang onto the reins of your life.
one move can change the dynamic.
but one day of euphemism, one bottle of kilo-away is not enough.
kilo-away doesn't work miracles.
it gives you the support you need in the long, hard way of success.
believe me, there's only one way to succeed.
step two.
white, pure and clear.
00 kilos lighter.
dark brown almost shit.
00 kilos lighter.
once again, i beat the festival nun.
shall we choose a wildflower that knows ourselves, a astronaut or a tropical bird living in the amazon?
i don't like big tits.
let's see.
your glucose level is higher.
not exactly pathological, but you should be careful.
you could be a diabetic.
your blood pressure's gone up.
after what you said, it's not weird.
don't worry, paula.
everything's gonna be okay.
just be careful what you eat.
if you weren't always with that girl...
what did you say?
nothing.
what are you doing, you fat ass?
you can use blood, hair, nails, body fluids, and...
it's a sample of the protolodic enzymes and replicators to separate the dna.
years ago this process was taking weeks.
this machine could be done in less than 00 hours today.
so i'm half of your note.
we're a couple of eggs, so the last two houses... these and these... should match.
i wasn't closed.
i even had a very nice boyfriend.
the thing is, it wasn't from the community.
i tried to get him into the community, but he wasn't much into spiritual stuff.
i mean, he didn't want to be a virgin until he got married.
he got tired of waiting and left me.
i got depressed, but then alex showed up.
honestly, alex was always there.
two eggs, fried rice, shrimp noodles and moo shu pork.
do you have fried potatoes?
a badge.
i want a salad with beans.
i got really fat when i started dating alex.
i can still go through another body.
why?
you have to eat, big bones.
that's why i brought you to the chinese restaurant.
let me eat what i want.
it won't work.
what happened to your cousin who lost weight in the gym?
look, it's fatter than it was before.
cover yourself, sofia, for god's sake.
that's what girls wear.
how long?
come on, you like it.
of course you do.
you like it.
you always do what you know.
you're forcing me to make a scene.
i'm not hungry anymore.
do you like what you did?
you lost my appetite.
sofi, really...
you're such a rebel.
how can i eat more than you without weight?
i looked around and all i could find was you two fat assholes.
your usual weakness and your sister were a little bit heavy.
fat bitch ruined my life from the start.
you got a lot of baby pictures.
i only found one.
and i was 0 years old.
adoption isn't that important.
family is not a biological issue.
stop teasing me!
don't say such things.
i'm going to go crazy and leave home.
thank god.
luis, you're not adopted.
what about the dna test?
if that's true.
nuria probably forgot to make hybrids of the samples.
i did, i put them in the thermomix steam loop.
how did you transfer the pieces to the nitro selulosis?
i wrapped my forehead in foil 00 minutes in the middle fire.
ten out of ten.
how did he do it again?
thanks to what?
thanks to me.
pilar, i'm rehearsing.
so i can fuck you.
good of you to think about my analyst.
you don't like it...
of course i do.
it's a nice big machine.
you want to try it?
now this is our routine.
we bring him chocolate, but since he can't eat it, we eat it.
then i vomit.
and then we share a movie, a super day.
then i'm super puking.
then dinner, some champagne, a beautiful view...
and i... vomit.
then he comfortes me.
then i comfort her.
i'm going to die!
why do you think you're throwing up so much?
i've come to the conclusion that for some reason my body isn't staying long.
my digestive was a normal thing, but suddenly it's working backwards.
i know what you're thinking, therapist.
aren't you sick of this nonsense?
aren't you sick of reality?
my life is normal for the first time.
just like i knew you were coming here to justify yourself so you could keep eating like a pig.
he condemns a man who doesn't deserve him.
what is it, paula?
what's this?
you tell me.
we'll discuss it later.
no, we'll discuss it now.
i don't care!
it's your fault i'm unhappy all day.
is that how he treats you?
does he throw away your food?
does it make you feel like shit?
or is it just me?
explain to me why you don't love me, you don't like me, i feel sick!
if you knew how much i hate you.
and you, watch your fucking kids.
now we've learned your shit, therapist.
"and the light came to earth...
"because he who does bad things stay away from the light, who hides it, his surgeries are unpunished."
wait, wait.
what are you doing?
go ahead.
it's my turn, not yours.
your turn for what?
since when do you have more than one orgasm?
first you wanted to be on top, now you want to be an orgasm twice.
what next?
i don't know, we'll find out.
were you touching yourself?
is that why you stay in the bathroom so long?
stop it.
are you crazy?
don't mess with me.
come here.
don't be silly.
you made me do everything!
shit!
look how upset you make me.
you think i like being like this?
look what i'm made of.
do you think that's good?
look at me, sofia.
look at me.
you think i want this?
no, my love.
i look at you, you look dirty.
dirty, dirty, dirty!
you...
damn tool.
what are you doing?
i'm trying to run it.
drowning him won't work.
tell me the truth, dad.
i want to know the truth.
being weak doesn't mean you're not family.
you're disgusting, fat and ugly, but you're smart, like my mom, like nuria.
you always treat me like an idiot.
i don't fit into this shitty family.
okay, i'll repeat the test to prove it to you.
but, luis, you're so smart.
there's nothing stupid about her body.
what the hell are you doing?
i need it for the test.
i have to rip your balls off.
what a clever boy i have!
i've been with you for ten years.
as soon as things get tough?
or is that hard?
am i the hard one?
therapist who treats fat people can't stand the sight of his fat wife.
you brought your job home.
look at me.
you can't even look at me.
don't you like me anymore?
tell me.
tell me what's difficult.
i don't want to look at you!
i love you with all my heart and i can't imagine life without you.
like i'm the most retarded person in the world.
because you are.
it's called a letter of love.
"nicodim asked jesus,
'how can a man be born alive?
john0.
the part i wrote.
"sofi, i know i won't be born again, i can't go back in time to correct my mistakes.
all i can do is learn from them to become stronger and not repeat them.
you're the one i want to learn to be better and be happy with.
i want to be thrown into an adventure and salvation together.
alex.
deal?
yeah, deal.
everything like before?
it'll be like before.
no sex until the wedding.
what about my orgasms?
okay.
and you'll get fat again.
what?
you said it: everything like before.
don't i look better now?
of course you do.
that's why i said it.
to keep us from sleeping with the devil.
asshole!
all this time you've been pulling me down, making me think i can't do any better.
i'm ashamed to be with you.
i'm glad it happened today because i realized i never wanted to see you again.
dirty!
jesus?
i'm sorry, jesus.
first, you or me?
you.
leave me, leave me, go!
i dumped him.
i love you, but i don't love you.
these relationships create a lot of addicts.
we decided to stay friends.
and when we agreed on that, we were together.
typical goodbye sex.
i wasn't fat.
i was nice and charming.
light and wild.
my doubts have begun.
maybe leaving wasn't such a good idea.
we decided to stay together.
every night, sleep deprivation and anxiety came back.
he wasn't there to comfort me.
i felt so terrible that i came to therapy on the wrong day.
sorry, i think i came at the wrong time.
the clock's not wrong, it's wrong.
i came to the bar.
i didn't want to go home.
suddenly i realized a man was always looking at me.
i thought you wanted to know how fat i was and i wanted to get up.
i asked the waiter for the check, but he said he paid for my drink.
i don't know how, the guy appeared with me.
we were drinking whiskey instead of coffee.
he kept saying how beautiful i was and he wasn't that bad.
then i remembered what i said about trying new things, experience with other men, and i find myself looking for comfort...
that's how i met the second guy i slept with.
what can i say?
better than any therapy.
i was desired, not fat.
of course, the following week i could feel fat and gross again and i couldn't stop eating.
i was supposed to be comfortable...
i was supposed to be comfortable.
that's how i met the third guy i ever slept with.
but something made me feel that you wouldn't approve of my behavior.
your idea may not mean a lot to me, but i guess i wasn't ready to hear it.
let's go.
where?
to london to meet your wife and children.
where did you think you were?
that's how i met the fourth guy i've ever slept with.
this was just like the second and third, handsome, happy marriage.
so i decided to continue sleeping with handsome and married men for three reasons:
i didn't want to connect.
i'm convinced it won't happen again this morning.
what convinced you?
the return of german.
i think that's why i slept with all those men.
i thought it would be easier to forget german.
if she didn't leave because i got 00 kilos, maybe she'd leave because i slept with 00 men.
you see, there's something i've decided to go after.
what did you decide to go after?
i don't know.
i don't even know if i'm gonna ask you to help me or to fuck me.
or help by fucking me.
because you're handsome and i know you're married.
and you, what's up?
jesus!
i loved you so much!
paula!
pregnant lady, are you there?
the ice cream is melting!
paula!
hello, this is abel.
i didn't understand why men with a handsome, happy marriage would want to sleep with a fat woman.
i was wondering.
until one day he stopped worrying.
so don't worry, i won't ask.
what's wrong?
you ruined everything.
everything.
luis, it was a joke.
if i let your jokes affect me like that, i'd have killed myself.
i'm glad i don't have a fat-ass twin sister.
stop whining.
of course we're twins.
not if our fathers are different.
what?
twins have different fathers.
you messed it up good this time!
tell me who you are!
tell me!
tell me!
what's going on?
what's going on here?
tell him who his father is.
you're my father.
at least tell him!
tell him who he is!
he deserves to know who the father is!
tell him who you fucked instead of me!
i've been with you my whole life!
i've endured this shitty life!
hello, this is abel.
please come.
i'm so scared.
what are you doing, pilar?
i'm trying to put on the wedding ring, but i can't.
he lost weight in a coma.
forget it.
listen to me.
go home and get one of those sleeping pills with a glass of warm milk.
you're too emotional.
what are you doing?
let me try.
she would have liked it, too.
marry me.
what do you say, pilar?
you wanna go straight to the wedding at the funeral?
you should think about it.
i've been thinking about it for a while.
marry me, please.
why would a good-looking, smart, loving woman marry a gay?
i mean with me.
i don't understand.
my love for you is true.
i don't even know if you like me a little bit.
i live for you.
only for you.
marry me.
uploading video.
"fatos fucking," loaded.
i never expected you to be perfect for 00 years because you were.
you were perfect for me.
we were perfect for each other.
we had everything.
i know it's only once in a lifetime.
i'll be in the hospital for 0 days.
when i get out of here, i want you to leave the house.
you know more than anything is hurt.
today we will discuss the role of the man and woman in marriage.
it may seem obvious, but it's more tricky than you think.
no, my love...
please, don't...
don't go!
come, pray with me!
sofia, what's wrong?
somebody do something.
please!
you should do this yourself.
but the only thing you can really trust is yourself.
you and only you will taste victory.
step 0.
i never took care of my children.
in fact, they were just intruders who were there to get in a headache and stand up.
the thing is, what if somebody's not mine?
i shouldn't mind, should i?
i should be glad.
i was 00.
i didn't think i'd live this long.
i wasn't wrong.
i can't lose weight even if i die.
i've been obsessed with finding nuria's true dad for six months.
i ran dna tests on our family, friends, neighbors.
i even got a sample from my deceased brother faye, who went for a walk with beatriz after lunch when we spent on the countryside.
