michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, he was his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss mom.
i'll tell him
i need to write at least 000 words about the moral side of the war and the ability of a conflict.
i'm not sure the ethics teacher would like me to cheat while writing a test.
so, you passed my moral test.
in fact, he was desperate for his teacher, who was in the genuine lethbai betaerlyad.
even the criminals who commit minor crimes can be disabled.
no ring no ring
try to remember everything he said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
you have to do something about my son.
and you, my father, adopted?
the fg.d.k.' s eye was on us.
your father thought it would make us look more charitable.
he must have imitated my signature.
i'll have a son who's finished his cottage cheese.
you've got to get me out of
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't take care of him
i no longer have a mother's compassion and milk.
hello.
michael.
there's two girls here.
a couple of fun girls... couple of
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yeah, yeah.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
meanwhile, lindsay was doing his homework with george michael.
why do i tell you this?
i guess it's because there's some things you can't
lindsay thought george michael was trying to set up his teacher... to help him fulfil his maternal mission.
there's nothing wrong with that.
but i must express to you that i'm a little hurt that you haven't thought of me about it.
the aunts can carry out the mission.
the teachers can do that.
one day, you will find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay was never so proud of her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i keep telling you about.
she's really... the young girl.
your date, nazh... your date, your
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma, you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache
yeah.
but gob mistook michael's kindness for sentimental attention... and felt he was competitive to interfere.
because, you know, beyond adorable love... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
[ nazhgalia, michael, shannon ] really?
and george sr. was about to have a surprise visit.
i've read all your teachings and bought all your tapes.
and i watched it all again.
[ narrator ] george sr. had recently marketed a series of tapes... that he has recently offered to gain money from his new spirituality.
i also lost two kilos eating your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to find out where
this is a good place to start.
and michael got out of the two girls he had a date with, and he met lindsay at parent-teacher night.
hey, linds, is this my imaginary product... or does this monk room have the same floor plan with our kitchen floor?
i think he's very good for you.
i thought it would make her think of her maternal concept.
besides, i can't rush a job like this just because my son wants me to and marry someone.
i'm mrs. baerly, the ethics
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life... so that they can't be thoughtless with a pull of a trigger.
and michael became familiar with his son's ethics teacher.
that's what this is about.
you know, it's very frustrating
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you laugh.
"rrrr.!
but, you know, but, you know,
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent-teacher invite a drink?
or... or...
yeah, he's dead
i think it's because of this mr. daniels paralysis disaster of mr. daniels,
let's go get a drink.
yeah, maybe it'll help
george sr. was dealing with his own admirer.
i've already told you many of my sins.
maybe you could tell me some of your sins.
well, there are legal demonstrations that show my sins.
but, back to your sins.
tell me about one of those things... and one of them at the college dorm again.
and what's the deal with mrs. bayerly, the second date today... today... is...
michael, this little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it's him.
you have to peel him to the pants to tell me for sure.
yes, mom.
they'll take him back.
don't take your shoes off, little mister!
don't take your shoes off!
it's out of
who's that
this is "annyong, your father and i have adopted.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille realized that buster was concerned, even jealousy.
and he knew what it was like to be ignored.
now annyong is your brother now your sister
cancel it.
he's stay
listen, i'll call you back.
it was a nice
you having dinner reservations?
he's made a "ufak korean.
and after their meeting......
michael's had a step he hasn't
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a great idea.
but how are we going to sneak in without waking everyone up
this may not be the best idea i've ever had.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i loved from you.
i got someone you love.
i'm the "nashbashbaglajam'd
listen, i know you're trying to get revenge on marta.
i was lying to you when i said i wasn't gonna try to sleep with her, so...
he has to accept that.
i don't think there's gonna be a problem
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i really had the chance to get rid of it.
it's ok
it's so
who's "n betn-ahdenin?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i must say i don't know if it's real.
but now... your morale teacher... is now... your
yeah, i did it for her.
oh.
he likes saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm pretty sure you're interested in her... by the point of
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
is it about his class?
i mean, she loves him... the way he lov
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with her.
well, why would he do that?
why did he sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new... new... new...
he's not one of the good shotguns, and he'll shoot anywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think she's old?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
she used to accompany young girls in different dances... and i thought about going to her place with a prank... and, uh, i thought
"celalam, do you want to dance or something
and that's something, i thought you're gonna, " what's gonna happen, okay
i did it different in front of the mirror, but
but, you know, uh, we're dancing mixed with jokes or doing something else.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should date someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've applied a book that's hard to find a picture of saddam's shower suite.
" what would he do? "
yeah.
yeah, you know anything?
okay, that's the same way our fire escape came out.
in prison, george sr. was preparing for the evening with his most loyal fan.
when cindi lightballoon made his own preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael, while he's still mad at gob... he's gone looking for a family expert to cause trouble.
i know you're dating shannon.
with that cheerleader?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different
i wish i could get someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels, and i asked him... but he breathed and dropped the phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe we should both go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example... an evil example...
hello.
mom took it.
he's making me sign it to school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the george michael situation with mrs. bearly.
i'm sorry.
hey.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality... if you
see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, he's like, he's in love with you, so
he knows we're out.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most unethical thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been teaching ethics for half a sem
look, it was a preliminary move.
my brother was gonna try to sleep with you.
so, i want to leave you at this exact moment, and i'm not coming back to you.
i understand.
from now on.
he went for a walk with george sr. cindi.
george.
and he's getting to know her
you can totally pour me in here.
it's weighing weight
you, you,
he's grabbing the camera
i'm taking your dinner, this is your dinner, away with mom.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby to a place.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy
watch your back, my little brother immigrants!
and the different spring dance was in the final theme.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting him in because he's not just his perfectly good-looking, flat-shaped eyes, strong square jaw.
you wanna dance?
all right!
so gob finally found the shannon he was looking for
gobun found out he cheated on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i messed up, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about it for, and-and-and-
that's... you mean the right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, with my moral teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
after being so bad to you, i'm really overheard of you trying to protect me.
in fact, gob mistooked michael's ethics teacher with a local citizenship teacher.
man, he... he understands the type.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a public defender teacher.
second act.
i was seeing miss baerly, and i should never have involved gob.
but the day you told me you liked him, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with the kids
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed at some very sad things, but... but... but...
i don't think we have a future together.
and, jeremy, i'm taking this cupcake.
hey, you want to dance?
i can't believe this is working.
he's in the next arrested development.
buster's pickup would be nasty.
stop, stop, stop, stop!
no candles are allowed here.
mom would go crazy.
no, it's okay.
i'm lighting my own candle.
yeah, that's what i'm gonna do
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
it's ok
right here, let me help you.
these too?
okay, i'll move it for you.

this abandoned prison.
wow!

how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know if this is a prank?
right.
this is our third show, but we're not gonna publish it until the fall.
you're gonna have to play the game and earn the money to find out if this is a prank.
you will be asked to carry out a series of missions.
the missions will force your borders, your courage and your thoughts.
that sounds like fun, doesn't it?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make your decision now.

i didn't have a girlfriend to admit it even when she was
i need to keep an eye on my little brother

some people died there.
like what?
move around.
you'll find out.
the total money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if you all make it through the night, there's a rich prize.
no money could get me to spend the night here.
anyone else want to join him?
i'm not.
there's no way i'm going all the way to the

welcome, my little pigs, the mission.
now, let me tell you about pennyville state prison.
in the time of the crisis in 0000, when the costs were bigger, the ruthless director thought of destroying a few expenses.
they were prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed before the director was exposed.
the last person here was sentenced to death row, he was principal harvis himself.
rumor has it that the manager was still walking around the halls.
tonight you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured souls under this building.

they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, take it easy, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung the babies!
their children... children
i think they've got it covered with speakerphones.
the voices are more effective than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
god!
that sounds great.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy guy.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't
something came up.

i think we've done something really great.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.

i don't think i can do it
they can assign you back.
no kidding.
i swear you don't even know how people feel in there.

big lips, large hips, taylor.
okay, prison isn't just for men?
is there a women's department?
and that fucking wacky warden wandered around the women's department, never answered anyone.
he beat them, raped them, knocked them up, and then starved them to death.
some say he feed his own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this real story's gonna interest you!
anyone could be talking to us.
this story you're making is nothing compared to the truth.
i think so.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do that, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
is that so?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yeah, they're working.

yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i gave up.
you'll tie toni up.
i'm transferring you from here, toni should fully fear the fears of the prisoners before the gas was given immediately.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends had weird demands.
are you okay?
okay.
" your mission of the gas teammate... "
" to find the main vane and cut the gas before it does. "
you need to watch the pipes.
it makes sense.
