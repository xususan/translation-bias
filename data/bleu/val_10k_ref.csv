michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, it was with his younger brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think us sleeping together is working out.
yeah, i miss mom.
i can tell.
i'm supposed to write 200 words on the morality of war... whether a preemptive strike is ever justified.
i'm not sure if my ethics teacher would love if i cheated on my essay.
well, you just passed my ethics test.
[narrator] in fact, george michael had developed a hopeless crush... on his ethics teacher, a woman named beth baerly.
even minor crimes are punishable... by brutally chopping off the offender's hand.
no ring.
try to remember everything she says about me, all right?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
did you and dad adopt a child?
the s.e.c. was onto us.
your father thought it would make us look charitable.
he must have forged my signature.
well, maybe i'll get a son who will... finish his cottage cheese.!
you've got to get me out of this.
i'll call social services, but you must take buster back.
but i'm not taking care of him either.
i don't have the milk of mother's kindness in me anymore.
hello.
{ gob] michael.
i've got a couple of girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
so we had a little disagreement.
i'm offering you an olive branch here.
yeah-yeah.
besides, when was the last time you slept with someone?
[narrator] meanwhile, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
well, i don't know why i'm telling you this.
i guess there's just some things you can't really say to your dad.
[narrator] lindsay believed that george michael wanted to fix up his father... so he could fill the role ofhis mother.
there's nothing wrong with that.
although, i must say i'm a little hurt that you haven't considered me.
aunts can fill that role.
teachers can fill that role.
and, someday, you're gonna find the right woman to fill that role.
but until then, i'll be right across the hall.
[narrator] lindsay had never been more proud of anything she had said in her entire life.
[narrator] meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to show up.
this is shannon, the girl i've been telling you all about.
girl, indeed... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and so she's your date.
"oh... { laughs] ""nagarma,"" you've got a mustache."
i mean, you've got a milk mustache.
yeah.
[narrator] but gob mistook michael's basic human decency for romantic interest... and felt a competitive urge to step in.
because, you know, it's beyond adorable... and e-exotic.
i find you very attractive.
{ nazhgalia, michael, shannon] really?
[narrator] and george sr. was about to get a surprise visitor.
i've studied all your teachings, and i've purchased every tape.
and i watch 'em over and over.
[narrator] george sr. had recently marketed a line of self-help tapes... touting his newly discovered spirituality.
i've also lost four pounds on your low-carb bluth banana jail bars. { giggles]
i've come to learn at your feet.
that's a good place to start.
[narrator] and michael, free ofhis double date, met lindsay at parent-teacher night.
hey, linds, is it my imagination... or does this rape room have the same floor plan as our kitchen?
well, i think she's perfect for you.
you'd think that would turn him off to the entire concept.
besides, i'm not gonna rush out and marry somebody just because you think my son would like it.
i'm ms. baerly, the ethics teacher.
my goal is to teach your children about the preciousness oflife... that can be lost by the mindless pulling of a trigger.
[narrator] and so michael got to know his son's ethics teacher.
"i guess that's the ""rrrr"" of it."
you know, so frustrating.
i mean, they just threw this class at me after mr. daniels had a stroke.
thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing 'cause you were laughing.
"""rrrr!"" - { laughs] ""rrrr!"""
but, you know, l-l...
and i think i'm an ethical person.
right.
here's an ethical question.
can-can a parent take a teacher out for a drink?
or...
yeah, she died.
well, it's the mr. daniels stroke thing...
let's go get that drink.
yeah, it could only help.
[narrator] george sr. was dealing with his own admirer.
oh, i've already told you so many of my sins.
maybe you could tell me some of yours.
uh, well, there are legal implications to that.
but, uh, back to your sins.
uh, do that one about the, uh... { takes deep breath] ladies' shower... in your college dorm again.
[narrator] and michael was on his way to what would be his second date...
michael, the little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with him.
at least, i think it's a him.
you've got to strip them down to next to nothing before you can even tell.
yeah, mom.
they will take him back.
shoes on, mister.!
shoes on.!
he's out of control.
who's that?
"this is ""annyong,"" who your father and i have adopted."
what, i'm gone for a couple days and you find a new son?
[narrator] lucille could see that her son was concerned, even jealous.
and she knew how it felt to be overlooked.
annyong is your brother now.
call it off.
i'm keeping him.
look, i gotta call you back.
sweet ride.
are you making dinner reservations?
"a ""little korean"" dropped off."
[narrator] and after their date...
michael took a step he hadn't taken in years.
okay, do you think this is a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mmm.
such a good idea.
but how are we going to sneak in without waking everyone up?
this may not have been my best idea.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but it looks like we're even.
you took something i liked.
i took something you liked.
"i... { beeps]...""nashbagerlajam."""
listen, i know that you've been trying to get even with me about marta.
i was lying when i said i wasn't gonna to sleep with her, so...
she'd have to agree to it.
i don't anticipate a problem with that.
right.
i just slept with one.
again, didn't like nazhgalia.
really, and good luck getting rid of her.
not a problem.
oh, so romantic.
"who's ""n. bahn-ahden?"""
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something before, but i didn't know if it was real.
but now, uh... your ethics teacher...
yeah, i just made this for her.
oh.
she loves saddam hussein.
i'm sure she is interested in him... as a subject, you know.
i'm sure she doesn't love saddam.
you know, i just wanted to make her something special to show that i care.
about the class?
you mean, you love her like...
hi, george michael.
i'm gonna go home and think about it.
i'm gonna go home, think about it.
dad, what was she doing here?
[narrator] michael knew he had an ethical responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yes.
your uncle gob slept with her.
well, why would he do that?
why would gob sleep with my ethics teacher?
you and i know that, but gob he just...
he's not that exact of a target shooter, and he just kind of sprays it everywhere.
you know, but listen, did-did you really think that-that... that you had a...
i mean, she's kinda old for you, don't you think?
we don't even know how old she is.
no one does.
she was chaperoning the diversity dance... and i thought maybe as a joke, i'd go up to her and be, like...
"""well, hey, do you want to dance?"""
"and she'd be, like, ""ah, what the heck?"" right?"
i did it differently in the mirror, but...
but, you know, like, we'd be joke dancing or something.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should be taking somebody your own age?
like your cousin.
i defaced a rare book to get that picture of saddam hussein in a bathing suit.
"""what would saddam do?"""
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that is our exact outdoor fire pit.
[narrator] at prison, george sr. was preparing for an evening with his most devoted fan.
while cindi lightballoon was making preparations ofher own.
how we doin'?
[man] we have video.
[narrator] so george michael, still angry at gob... sought out the family expert on making trouble.
i know he was dating that girl shannon.
the cheerleader?
yeah, she's probably gonna take him to that stupid diversity dance.
i wish i had someone shocking to take.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and asked him... but he got all out of breath and dropped the phone.
i never heard back.
you know, may-maybe we should go together.
right, i mean, it's a bad example...
hello.
my mom bought him.
she's making me register him for school.
he's my new little brother.
so we're related.
[narrator] and michael went to discuss the george michael situation with ms. baerly.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
you mean, you're interested in him.
this is what i want to talk to you about, though.
but i've enjoyed my time with you.
you ever wanna talk ethics...
you see, george michael made this poster for you.
you know, he-he kind of, uh, is in love with you, so...
he knows we're going out.
i told him that you slept with my brother.
that may be the most unethical thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been doing this half a semester.
look, it was a preemptive strike.
my brother would've tried to sleep with you.
well, i want you to leave right now and not come back.
i understand.
starting right now.
[narrator] george sr. went on a walk with cindi.
george.
and she was getting to him.
you can feel safe to fully reveal yourself to me.
{ sighs] it's weighing heavy on my soul.
you, uh...
he's pinching the camera.
so, it's off with mother now.
[narrator] in fact, lucille was just giving annyong and maeby a ride.
you're trying to steal from the wrong man.
watch your back, my little immigrant friend!
[narrator] and the spring diversity dance was in full swing.
whoa, sorry.
so you're not letting him in because he doesn't share your perfectly shaped nose... your round eye-shaped eyes, your strong square jaw.
you wanna dance?
all right!
[narrator] and gob sought out shannon...
who had found out he had cheated on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
oh, hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
look, i blew it, okay?
beth.!
um, i blew it okay?
i had to see you.
l-i've been giving this a lot of thought, and-and...
oh, that's... that's your definition of the right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing at a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girl.
yeah, my ethics teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
i'm really touched that you'd stick up for me after i've been so horrible to you.
[narrator] in fact, gob mistook the civics teacher... for the ethics teacher michael was dating.
man, he... has a type.
gob, mrs. whitehead was the civics teacher.
two strikes.
l-i've been seeing ms. baerly, and i should never have brought gob into it.
but that day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never wanted to hurt you.
i didn't know you were that serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
i'm just saying someday, you know.
i'm not really into kids.
the lady said no, man.
look, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean we had some laughs about some very sad things, but...
i don't think we have a future.
and, jeremy, i will take that cupcake.
hey, uh, you wanna dance?
i can't believe that would have worked.
on the next arrested development.
buster's competition heats up.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.!
we are not allowed to have candles in here.
mom would freak.
oh, no, it's fine.
i'll light a candle of my own.
that's exactly what i'll do.
you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, that's all right.
really, it is.
you want me to help you out with this?
no problem.
here, let me just help you out here.
these, too?
okay, here, let me get that for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're proposing, connie, is, to say the very least, extreme.
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
move, move, move!
what are you doing?
get off me.
i don't wanna die.
we all gotta go sometime, huh?
four months ago, each of you little piggies attended auditions to be on a never-before-seen reality tv game show.
and guess what?
you won.
i think, in life, some people are meant to be on tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm totally off-the-hook gay and proud of it.
you're a cutie, aren't you?
i wanna lead our country.
next question.
my name is angel, on loan from england.
me, too.
he's my brother stanton/parole officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother dropped him on his head.
and he doesn't know.
well, but i do.
"dixon, 6'2"", 200 pounds."
you know, people used to say i look like will smith.
now they say barack obama.
to win $20,000 each, all you have to do is spend one night in a prison.
that abandoned prison.
whoa.
holy shit!
cool.
how come i've never heard of this show?
like, how do we know this is not some sort of frat house prank?
right.
this is actually our third show, but we won't be on-air until the fall.
and as for knowing if this is anything more than a college prank, you'll just have to play for the money to find out.
you'll be asked to perform a series of tasks.
tasks that will test your nerves, your courage and your sanity.
sounds like fun, right?
what kind of task are we talking about, dawg?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i can't have no girl do this while i take off.
i have to look after my baby sister.
i'm in.
you guys are insane.
do any of you know the history of that prison?
some really fucked up shit went down in there.
like what?
stick around.
you'll find out.
the total money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if all of you make it through the night, there will be a substantial bonus.
ain't enough money in the world to make me stay in that place.
anybody else wanna join him?
not me.
well, there's no way i'm riding all the way back to the city with urine boy.
oh, i'm in.
just get me the hell out of here.
your chariot awaits.
unlock him.
bye.
you guys are idiots.
this is for some fucking frat party joke and you're all gonna be made fun of.
you're all gonna look like a bunch of losers.
can't you just see this video playing at a party?
or we get famous.
there's a freaking human head in there!
don't worry, it's not real.
sure as hell looks real to me.
"what we in the business like to call a ""special effect""."
pretty cool, huh?
a little taste of what's waiting for you in there.
thanks to our award-winning special effects team.
follow me, my friends.
in the warm, swampy water, lazy crocodiles wait for the next meal.
the indian crocodiles have long, pointed faces.
these crocodiles are called...
boys.
i see you're working hard as usual.
are we ready?
totally ready.
totally and absolutely.
let's keep it that way.
yes, ma'am.
hey.
great job selling the fear out there, man.
yeah.
i can't believe any of those kids stuck around for the show.
you actually looked like you were terrified out there.
well, that's because i am.
i mean, first of all, just looking at that place totally creeps me out.
did you know about that?
about the dead homeless people?
sure.
why didn't you say anything?
that's kind of a lot of people for a coincidence.
i mean, do you really think it's safe in there?
safe enough to get the show insured.
any more questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like a baby.
let's do this.
okay.
we are filming.
all of you have chosen, of your own free will, to spend the night in this prison for the chance to win $20,000 each.
pretty straight forward, right?
okay, then let's get this party started.
you'll find everything you need in your base camp, which is located in the warden's office.
where's that?
well, it's kind of complicated.
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you took away all of our possessions, so how are we supposed to write it down?
go straight down the hall, hang a right, another right, then a left.
then straight on up the first flight of stairs, a left, a right, then one more left.
you want me to say it again?
yeah.
too bad.
when you get there, you'll find the key to release you from those shackles.
is there anyone else inside?
we'll just have to wait and see.
i thought coming out of the closet was scary.
have fun, inmates.
good luck.
where's she going?
welcome to the task.
can you please not do that?
i can't see a damn thing in here.
does anybody remember which way he said to go?
it's straight, a right, then a left.
no, it's straight, two rights then a left.
"too many ""straights""."
"no, it's, ""go straight down the hall,"
"""hang a right, another right, a left."
"""then straight on up the first flight of stairs,"
"""a left, a right, and one more left""."
what are you?
she's smart.
guys, we're gonna have a great show.
careful.
careful.
jesus.
what is this place?
okay, and get ready.
that was fun.
and speed them up.
yes, my queen.
come on!
now go!
left turn.
why am i not seeing anything?
shit, shit, shit, shit.
well, i don't know.
the power's going down, the backup should've kicked in by now.
shit!
hurry!
it's a weird glitch, huh?
careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
damn, it's cold in here.
look, key.
hell yeah.
okay.
hey, guys, look.
yeah, come on.
cool.
all right, you.
who's that?
i guess it's the warden.
get this one.
okay, yeah.
hey, check this out.
what you got, man?
"""greetings, brave contestants."
"""welcome to warden clem harvis' personal office."
"""in the center of the room is a box."
"""this chess piece will determine your own personal symbol."
"""you cannot trade with any of the other contestants."
"""razor blades were a personal favorite""."
"""now, it's your turn to put your hand in the box""."
shit.
so, who wants to go first?
me.
what the hell is going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i mean, i don't know.
seriously?
you should have seen all of your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black rook.
white knight.
white queen.
hey, look.
holy shit!
okay, that is really fucking creepy.
welcome, my little piggies, to the task.
now, for a little history of pennyville state prison.
in 1931, with the climbing budgets during the depression, the cold blooded warden thought he could keep his fortune on track by eliminating certain overhead costs.
his inmates!
eventually the warden was exposed, but not before having executed 85 inmates!
the last person to be served a death sentence here was warden harvis himself.
rumor has it that the warden still roams the halls.
tonight, you will be asked to go face to face with the warden, and the tortured souls that still inhabit the building you are now in.
task one.
white queen.
try not to die!
does anybody want to trade?
hell no!
okay.
"""the white queen will got to the prison chapel to complete his task."
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
still in the first hallway.
nice job with the sound.
hey, thanks.
oh, shit.
what?
they turned my torch off.
i can't see a damn thing.
okay, take it easy, randall.
now, make a right and go straight.
there's babies hanging!
children's...
i imagine they have the place wired for audio input.
audio being more profound in tapping into our primal fears than sight.
is that right?
okay.
god!
sounds like a real sweetie.
no, i'm good, man.
freaking stoner.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
it was a sound.
i think someone's in the room with me.
they're using speakers, randall.
seriously.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flash light.
okay, now what?
"""open the bible to the marked page..."
"""where you'll find the lord's prayer."
"""having been desecrated 75 years ago,"
"""this once holy place is a likely hotspot of paranormal activity""."
"oh, my. ""in reverse""."
no way.
oh, hell no, man.
don't do that shit.
i can't do that.
"""once your task is completed..."
"""if there is no sign of the warden,"
"""you can return to base camp""."
deep breath, randall.
just do it.
please forgive me, whoever i may be pissing off.
this wasn't my idea.
okay.
"""evil from us deliver"
"""our father who art in heaven..."
"""but temptation into not us lead."
"""and us against trespass..."
"""who those forgive we as trespasses our us forgive."
"""and bread daily our day this us give."
"""heaven in is it..."
"""as earth on done be will thy,"
"""heaven in art who father our""."
please say i can leave now.
"""before you head to the base camp""..."
god, randall, you have to blow out the candle.
you're joking, right?
and sit there for one minute.
the things i do for money.
where'd he go?
it would be my estimation that the production has cut off our ability... to communicate with our homosexual friend... in order to create a more terrifying atmosphere.
whatever.
sure, like clockwork.
guys?
i think we got some really good stuff.
guys?
guys?
guys!
do you see anyone?
no.
come on, dude, it couldn't have been that bad.
totally not worth the money.
but having done it, it was totally worth the money.
oh, thank god i'm finished.
look at me, i'm still shaking.
i don't think i could handle doing it again.
they might ask you to do another one.
don't joke.
i swear you can feel some kind of twisted vibe out there.
it's like walking through heavy fog, only it's ice cold.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
yeah, she's right.
i want to go next.
what exactly do you mean,
"""there are some cameras down""?"
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but this is pretty complicated stuff.
we'll get scelzi to go down... and have a look and fix them.
scelzi.
yeah.
yeah, i need you to go down and have a look at some cameras.
yeah.
boys.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
well, we talk now or i walk.
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
well, i've been doing a little research.
"and by ""research,"" what you actually mean... is you've been fucking one of the local girls."
am i right?
loose lips sink ships, taylor.
okay, this prison didn't just have a men's wing, all right?
it had a women's wing, too, all right?
and the twisted fucking warden would roam around it, naked, answering to no one.
he beat them, he raped them, made them have his children, then he starved them to death.
people say he even fed some of them their own babies.
what's your point?
my point?
my point is that the real story would have made the show a hit!
everybody would've been talking about us.
the story you cranked out is nothing compared to the real one.
i agree.
so why didn't we use it?
because the town said they'd sue us if we did.
right.
are we done here?
yeah.
oh, yeah?
what's that?
anyway, i'm gonna go take a nap.
they on?
yep, they're on.
sweet.
scelzi, what was that?
just a little something to get me through the night.
do you want?
just get your hairy butt back here, okay?
aye, aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the shit out of me.
i've got some good stuff.
suit yourself.
we are totally ready to go.
i would have to say my biggest fear would be being buried alive.
where do i go next?
"""this will lead you to freedom row""."
all right,
i'm at the end of freedom row.
what do i do next?
tell him to go right again.
go straight on and then right.
oh, shit!
what?
blood.
it's not real blood.
no shit, sherlock.
i love that girl.
oh, man, please tell me i get to go up and not down.
sorry.
eighty paces?
who do i look like, a pirate?
you should see a metal door... once you've gone a flight down.
it says...
damn.
"""welcome to solitary confinement, cell number five."
"""for the violent and frequently insane,"
shit.
look, just tell me what i need to do... so i can get the hell out of here.
no!
thanks.
you guys ever get tired of complimenting each other?
the things i do.
"it says, ""if an inmate failed in his suicide attempt,"
"""you are to now re-enact the torture of a prisoner""."
okay, so where is it?
under your feet.
i mean, this thing is, like, full of shit in here.
money, money, money.
that's a pretty harsh task.
"""once in the hole, you are to await further instructions""."
okay.
hello?
hello?
hey, no offense, but i really hope you're not my task.
connie.
what?
take a look at this.
what?
that isn't...
you're fired.
why?
you go behind my back and you hire some extra to be in the show... when i specifically told you not to, and you wanna know why you're fired?
that's not my guy.
where'd he go?
who the fuck was that?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you've got to get that guy out of there, all right?
i mean, this is gonna screw up the show.
damn.
this is gonna kill us.
you're sure this isn't just you screwing around?
scout's honor.
it's so obvious.
what is so obvious?
come closer.
remember when i asked you... why you were having snow rig cameras in the control booth?
yeah.
the network wanted some guys in there... to shoot some behind-the-scenes...
fuck me!
fuck me!
you're right.
it's kind of genius, isn't it?
it's total genius.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
you mean to tell me that the network is throwing some twists into the game just to see how freaked out we get?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
go on with the show.
as planned.
task three.
black king and white knight.
task four.
black rook and white queen.
told you you might have to do another task.
smartass.
okay, black king and white knight are to turn right and make their way to the gas chamber.
white queen and black rook are to go straight and head to the prison kitchen.
okay, laters.
good luck.
"""king and knight go left and then right."
"""rook and the queen go to the end of the hall"
"""and take the stairwell down""."
scelzi, pick up.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, pick up.
we're in.
"""welcome to the gathering room."
you should see a light switch at the rear wall.
"""black king and white knight are to enter the gas chamber""."
again, nice set, connie.
can't take credit for that, it's the real deal.
only thing the legal department could clear.
cool, right?
well, it's scary all right.
christ!
what's that smell?
it is a well documented fact... that execution chambers frequently have the smell of death in them.
of course the smell isn't actually death.
when a human knows his or her life is about to come to an end, it will tend to reach an anxiety level... that will cause it to emit highly noxious odors.
in this particular case, we're smelling a combination of human smells... and the smells of the gas used to kill said human.
now for the fun part, boys and girls.
black king gets to sit down in the gas chair.
black king?
that would be me.
and await further instructions.
"""there you'll find some meat and a pan."
"""this is to be cooked and eaten""."
oh, man!
"""inmates were always suspicious that meat supplied..."
"""was not cow, pig or lamb,"
"""but something else."
"""something sweet and nothing like anyone had ever tasted before""."
so, we're talking human flesh, right?
you in?
yes.
guess what you get to do now?
i give up.
you get to strap toni in.
i'm paraphrasing here, but toni should fully comprehend... the fear the victims felt when they were about to be gassed.
you're good at that.
let's just say, some of my girlfriends have been on the kinky side.
is that okay with you?
okay.
"""your task is to shut off the master valve"
"""before the gas terminates your teammate""."
you need to follow the pipes.
makes sense.
taking bets?
i will bet 100 on her throwing up.
done.
it's weird.
i can't do this.
i can't.
it's my worst nightmare.
come on, sweetie, that's the show.
"""no more college debt""."
look, remember what he said?
"""if the team wins, there'll be a substantial bonus""."
do it for the team, girlfriend.
you gonna hurl?
thank you.
okay, angel, i'm at the bottom of the stairs.
shit!
do you hear me?
he's back.
this really stinks.
let me out.
hey, come on.
hey, let me out, man.
my god!
who is that man standing there?
topless.
so manly.
let me out.
i don't know, con. this guy is actually starting to creep me out.
hey, stop playing.
let me out.
so, what's up?
i need to talk with you.
outside?
sure.
big news.
i think the company's playing us.
what?
who's there?
who are you?
show me the chamber.
shall we cover rook and queen?
where are they?
i don't know, but just give me one second.
there.
there's that guy again, see?
wow.
who the hell is that?
okay, how'd he get there so quick?
that's the guy from the painting, right?
yeah.
yeah, it... it looks like him.
cool.
no, not cool.
he either walks through walls, or there are more than one of them.
we all seen the prestige, right?
do you mind if we pass?
please?
guys?
guys?
fake blood pack, fake shiv.
nicely done.
in fact, maybe even oscar worthy.
no.
no, that's not right.
this is way, way off script.
it looked real to me.
connie, they are playing us.
trust me.
what?
look.
they copied the picture.
what?
casting.
costume.
easy.
hold on.
no.
no.
he's a real ghost.
can't get any more off than that.
he goes any further with him, he's gonna take him off my grid.
what?
look, it's a huge prison.
i mean, i couldn't put my cameras everywhere.
show me the hole.
show me the chamber.
taylor, somebody's gotta go in there and see if they're okay.
i can tell you, they don't look okay.
she's acting, acting, acting.
where is scelzi then?
i don't know.
probably off his face somewhere.
i'm gonna call the office.
yeah, you too.
good night.
they say they've got no idea what's going on here.
still feels wrong.
okay, i'll go and prove it to you.
no problemo.
anyone coming?
yeah, i'll go.
i'll grab a camera and get some cool footage.
thank you.
you must be nice to them.
easy peasy lemon squeezy!
"""easy peasy lemon squeezy""."
hey, you know what?
you're actually kind of photogenic.
yeah, so funny, pretty boy.
i want to do my task.
kill the air-con.
come on.
connie, what do you wanna do?
hold the game.
wow, this place is kind of spooky, right?
it gets a bit weird.
where'd he go?
i don't know.
i didn't see him.
he went right past here.
dead end.
what was that?
yeah, what was that?
shit.
taylor?
put angel on screen.
we need to get those kids out of there.
can you hear me?
listen up.
there's been a slight change of plans.
we're gonna need to stop the show.
what?
why?
i'm gonna be honest with you.
there is somebody in there with you.
who?
we're not sure.
but i need you to get yourself out of there as fast as possible, understood?
you're playing me?
you're trying to freak me out.
open the door.
i want to win and i want my money.
so open the door!
who opened the door?
sorry, you're not serious, are you?
idiot.
you're task is to memorize and locate the clearly marked cell seven.
lucky!
in this cell, warden harvis received a near fatal stab wound from an inmate.
you'll find a key in that cell, and this key can release both your inmate colleagues from the hole and the gas chamber.
cool.
is that all you got for me?
easiest money i've ever made.
what am i afraid of?
nothing.
angel!
stanton?
help!
great, now she's gone off my grid.
hello?
who's there?
hello?
angel?
angel.
put me down.
who are you?
angel?
angel!
what...
this isn't right.
put me down.
hold on.
it's you.
no!
angel, are you okay?
he killed my brother.
he's gonna kill me.
he killed my brother.
new jersey school of acting.
not bad for a straight guy, right?
connie, you there?
yeah, just about.
how in the hell did you organize all of this?
with great difficulty.
it's gonna make a great show.
i will deal with you later.
i'm gonna de-rig some of my shit first, okay?
you really are an asshole.
you said you wanted a great show, didn't you?
well, you got it.
yeah.
you go wrap toni, i'll get dixon and stanton.
okay, snow, that's a wrap.
hey, guys, you all go get cleaned up and change.
let's get ready for the wrap party and some champagne.
great acting work.
show's over.
toni?
good job, dixon.
okay, dixon.
that's a wrap, buddy.
you okay?
quit dicking around, snow.
hey, you got anything to say?
we have to get them out of there.
we have to get them out of there.
get that out of my face!
divert to new coordinates, 5-1-7-7-7-9-4.
roger that, atc.
i spy with my little eye something beginning with r.
if you can't get it, you do a forfeit.
rain?
london control, the package was supposed to be in cia custody 19 minutes ago.
our aircraft is waiting.
good job our guest's not in a hurry.
traffic tower says they'll be moving within eight minutes.
the home office cupboards are bare.
we're going to have to be a little bit more imaginative with our funding.
where the bloody hell is oliver?
where's the air cover feed?
you can overrule, but you'll need to issue an executive countermand.
something's got to be done.
director general.
i know you don't like hearing this from a politician, but reform is coming.
you do know that lift is for emergencies only?
escort two, what's your status?
you got ants in your pants, juney?
you know, you would be a lot less uptight if you'd just let yourself be my london girlfriend.
the position's not gonna be open much longer.
i spy with my little eye something beginning with...
bikes, travelling at speed.
put them up.
calum, nearest police units?
scramble everything we've got, now.
code one!
attack in progress!
oh, my good god.
june, for christ's sake, don't.
get out, now!
lethal force is authorised.
open the van or everyone dies.
open the van now!
pearce.
the americans will crucify us.
your operation, harry.
say again, control?
lay down your weapons and release qasim.
what the bloody hell are you doing, harry?
open the gates!
open the gates!
go, go, go!
control, prisoner escaped!
heading north!
no, no, no!
keaton!
control, lead two pursuing on foot.
any more feeds?
follow her.
nearest armed unit's eight minutes away.
helicopter's 20 miles out.
roadblocks?
in place.
other side of that tunnel and the last junction.
there's nowhere for them to go.
sco19 is seven minutes away.
go.
lead two, report.
ed, wait.
lead two, report.
i repeat, the cia liaison officer has been shot.
lead two, do you have eyes on qasim?
control, i hear a vehicle.
they've knocked everything out.
it's over.
the bbc can confirm that the american terrorist leader adem qasim has escaped from mi5 custody in one of the most serious failures in the organisation's history.
it's understood that the secure convoy transporting qasim came under armed attack en route to raf northolt.
you say it's not war but murder because it happens on western streets.
because you didn't ask for it in new york, in washington, in london.
but the children of pakistan, they didn't ask for it either.
when they're bombed by drones, they call it murder, too.
qasim presents a new kind of threat.
so far, he hasn't targeted civilians.
our models show a 90% chance of attack within 48 hours.
the more pressure he's put under, the smaller that window becomes.
i can't tell you while the tape's...
the secretary of state flies in tomorrow.
we serve the british people, not washington.
if that's no longer true, then we're already finished.
the americans feel we're no longer fit for purpose.
we need a scalp.
i'm to be decommissioned in the morning.
you heard nothing about qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, if you're out, what happens to me?
you get out, too.
no one else knows you're inside qasim's network.
just walk away.
will holloway?
go.
so, how is life after mi5?
you're not from the moscow section.
you're needed back in london.
anyone you need to say goodbye to?
thank you.
we know about harry's connection to your family, so we understand this may not be easy for you.
it'd be fine, even if he was dead.
harry's too bloody arrogant to kill himself.
he was certainly acting like someone who was about to.
he went to visit this woman's grave.
love of his life.
harry's team has noticed changes in his behaviour since her death.
he's become emotionally distant, cold, been drinking heavily.
the water would have been below nine degrees.
he'd have developed hypothermia before reaching the bank.
this is a picture before he walked into shot, and this is a picture after you say that he jumped.
before he disappeared, harry made three encrypted phone calls.
your ex-service emergency voicemail.
why call you?
i have no idea.
last time i spoke to him was the night he decommissioned me from mi5 three years ago.
well, he wants to chat now.
that makes you useful.
will you help us find him?
no, thanks.
you and harry ever talk much about berlin?
the night your father died?
if there's something else, mace, i have a right to know.
oh, i don't think it's up to me...
if you're not going to actually murder him, i think you've made your point.
find harry and you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
although i doubt i'll take that title to the grave.
until recently, head of counter-terrorism for her majesty's security service.
funny, but who are you really?
someone who knows what these two words mean to you.
asma shishani.
go.
how did you find me?
so what do you want?
i know it was someone on my side.
they never told me who they were.
of course they didn't, but you must have had a contact.
a phone number, that's all.
a phone number will do nicely.
and in return, i'll give you what you want.
there is no way you could get that.
she said she was a human rights lawyer.
helped two of my brothers after they were imprisoned by your government.
but after i was freed, she became too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if she's a spy, she's not one of ours.
just so i'm clear again, tell me she's nothing to you.
you keep her alive, she's your guarantee that i'll keep my word.
i don't need guarantees.
get her to a hospital now, or the deal's off!
what she needs is mercy.
no!
she has a daughter.
and still, you sent her after me?
you put her in danger and then you refuse to spare her the pain?
what sort of a man are you?
spare her family from the video.
harry...
you've got a deal.
the bbc understands there has been no breakthrough in the hunt for escaped terrorist adem qasim.
the national threat level has been raised to critical, indicating an attack is imminent.
in business news, the ftse 100 fell again this morning and sterling continued to slide against the dollar, the euro and other major trading currencies.
we have fresh intel on harry.
he bought a pay-as-you-go phone that we tracked to the kent coast.
holloway, this is classified.
we found traces of explosive there, too.
you've known him longer than any of us.
do you think it's at all possible qasim might have got to harry somehow?
turned him?
i don't know.
regardless, find harry, we find qasim.
anything for holloway?
there you are.
tomorrow, 12 pm.
park in short stay one, row a, bay one.
then, keep your eyes open.
i hope you'll come alone.
for protection only.
if you can't bring in one loopy cold war relic without shooting him, we really are in trouble.
no promises.
it says not to yet.
we play this harry's way until we've got eyes on him.
roger that.
doors opening.
go.
level zero.
doors opening.
open sightlines, multiple exits.
say again, holloway.
they're harry's requirements for running a meet.
yes, mr holloway, your uncle said he'd meet you at the coffee shop.
he left his mobile at home.
guy in the car park, get rid of him.
he might as well be wearing an mi5 t-shirt.
listen to me.
stop underestimating harry.
don't think he won't put your people in danger.
we wait for him to make his...
what is it, alpha one?
holloway?
holloway, where are you going?
wait.
no, we're not set up there.
stand down.
holloway, stand down!
terminal 5b.
doors closing.
he's booked me on a flight.
pa309 to glasgow.
i'm going to glasgow.
call the glasgow office.
get me the airport police ops command.
priority code sigma nine.
police request a clearer path to the terminal.
and get us cleared by heathrow security.
all remaining passengers for flight pa309 to glasgow...
holloway, do not go airside.
what am i doing here, harry?
i need to find someone outside the service that i can trust.
it's a short list when you take off the drunk, the mad and the dead.
it's quite telling, the fact that the closest thing i have to a friend is someone who thinks i ruined his life.
qasim's escape was sanctioned by someone at the very top of the service.
by one of the people who asked you to track me down.
that's why i had to disappear.
you had qasim.
he's our only connection to the traitor.
once he's in the system, he'll be silenced.
he's planning an attack.
someone wants to destroy the service itself.
you've lost it.
ruth's death...
don't!
look at it yourself, that's all i'm asking.
what do you expect, harry?
mi5 was all i had and you took it from me, for nothing.
hate me all you like, but i think you believe in the service.
what happened in berlin?
so that's how they got to you?
this may not pan out as you'd hoped.
i'm afraid i had to tip them off that there's something in the lining of your jacket.
nothing there of course, but they'll have to check.
i'm going to send you a number.
call me in 24 hours, please.
i am security services.
hands behind your back!
so you just let him walk away.
calm down, francis.
we wouldn't want you to have a stroke.
not a fatal one, anyway.
mi5 is looking like a complete liability right now and i'm just about the last friend left in government it has.
so you should really be nice to me.
in other words, he's lost the plot?
that wouldn't contradict his last three psych evaluations.
he refused to attend them.
well, he hasn't stopped being harry pearce.
even completely gaga, i'd still take him over...
well, this chap, for example.
asked me to help him disappear.
it didn't occur to you to agree and then turn him over to us?
just because your life hasn't been worth a damn since harry booted you, don't think we can't very easily make it even less satisfactory.
since we're all threatening each other, you three should be under no illusions that you're not teetering on the edge.
your whole organisation is looking pretty bloody disposable right now.
find qasim.
fully loaded.
they are ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i've seen that name in a case study.
i thought they decommissioned you.
they did.
now, what really happened?
the escape may have been set up by someone in the service.
do you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i only gave up six weeks ago.
there must be one here.
just tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't apply.
when i was 17, i went out with a guy who did money transfers.
k section were interested in some of the people using it, so they approached me.
so you started as an agent?
and when i was done, they asked me to train as an officer.
my family laughed when i told them that.
and if someone you worked for had helped qasim to escape, that would matter, right?
okay.
something did feel wrong that day.
rob vass, my team leader, he was in the lead car with me.
he told me not to open the weapons compartment.
he ordered me not to pursue.
where does he live?
loaded.
w78 account prefix.
panama city.
service slush fund.
june, what the hell are...
who are you?
you told me not to pursue qasim.
that's what you said to me when i went for my weapon.
we swore an oath, rob.
i'm not saying anything until we get to thames house.
we're not going to thames house.
will, what have you found?
qasim's escort was deliberately weakened.
the team leader was in on it.
he's just the errand boy.
find out who gave the order.
the americans think mi5 is a weak link and i think somebody here agrees with them.
qasim escapes, we're disgraced.
the cia quietly take over.
he was...
he was going to fire.
we could...
he's dead, he's dead.
he's dead.
listen.
you have to go home.
june!
i'll deal with this, but you have to go, now.
i've never heard a piece murdered with such glee.
who's warrender batting his eyelashes at?
landon miller.
agency hawk.
he's trying to secure their continued support, hopefully without handing over the keys to the kingdom.
every time i see you, francis, you seem to be buried another inch or two deeper in the recesses of some swivel-eyed wonk from langley or the pentagon.
you don't have to tell me.
i just think, in times like these, we all need to remember which flag flies over our heads.
francis.
i'm trying to help and he practically accuses me of moonlighting for the cia.
tonight, your generals, your politicians, your spies, met for a celebration.
tonight, we struck back at the heart of their power.
our enemies are the politicians who send your sons and your daughters to die in illegal wars.
the spies who spy on you, like you are the criminals.
this fight goes beyond religious differences.
all flights out of the uk...
you had him.
warrender would be alive.
if you have a way to get to qasim, give it up, right now.
there's another way.
qasim's wife.
asma shishani.
the fsb have her.
if i can work out where they're holding her, he'll give up the traitor.
you made a deal with him.
yes.
and if we see it through, it'll lead us to him.
come in now and we'll set it up.
how do you know the russians have his wife?
in exchange for a blown cia officer stuck in moscow.
i can remotely access it, but i need you to open the back door.
this is an ip address.
you are joking.
it's the only way, will.
harry's getting help from somewhere.
i've ruled out old contacts, but i need access to personnel files to do it properly.
still won't get you anywhere exciting.
in place.
seems like i'm going to have to steal a lot of extra bandwidth.
the borough's.
malcolm?
okay, i'm in.
trawling the servers now.
harry, we need to get moving.
can we do this any quicker?
i could, yes.
unfortunately, this machine is pre-millennial.
g branch already pulled these.
erin watts.
might be worth a closer look.
fill in the blacked-out bits for me.
but i had an agent left exposed.
i almost got him out.
i'd been in that job less than a year.
sooner or later they make you choose.
well, i'll let you get on.
are we nearly there?
sure about what?
i'm sorry, will.
harry.
harry!
harry, what did you do?
stand away from the computer.
i've never had to say this to you before, but i hope you know what you're doing.
is harry working with qasim?
he stole an entire gchq data archive.
everything we have on friendly western agents in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
he popped up on schönefeld airport's cctv.
i don't know.
harry didn't run that cyber attack himself.
so who's helping him?
besides you.
and still you're protecting him.
why?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i can find him.
and chatter's spiking.
analysis indicates a large-scale attack in the next 48 hours, suggesting multiple targets.
an officer present at qasim's escape is missing.
signs of a struggle in his home.
know anything about that?
how's your mother, holloway?
doesn't keep too well, i hear.
never has, since your father died.
understandable, really.
and then comes that knock at the door.
i know, i know.
harry was right about one thing.
you're not good enough.
home secretary, can we really hope to stop qasim striking again?
we have faced down threats to our freedom and way of life time and again.
your ability to wound us may be significant, but it is finite.
you will find our resolve to be without limit.
they're not listening.
have they never killed our women?
we're making a better world, brother.
transfer team in position at city airport.
we have atc authorisation to hold the runway for prisoner transport when necessary.
i think i owe you one.
you kept quiet about vass.
danke.
alexanderplatz.
northeast corner by the subway, 11:00 am.
we have a safe house.
call it nostalgia.
don't forget to bring the archive.
don't forget to bring his wife.
how did you find me?
there's only one place to run a meet in berlin.
you used to tell me.
northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
undone by sentimentality.
that's the price of qasim's wife.
once she's out of fsb custody, he gives me a phone number.
that gets me to the traitor.
they'll destabilise the service to the point where it's justifiable to take it over.
get in the car, harry.
there's an old hotel 10 minutes away.
my contact can meet us there with clean passports for all three of us.
you're going home.
sorry about this.
why are you here, miss keaton?
keep moving, harry.
i killed someone because of you.
you're c2, aren't you?
what are you doing, harry?
talent spotting.
and which one of you found it?
for god's sake, will.
preparation is everything.
what about vass?
when you came to my house, i called it in.
said someone was asking about qasim's escape.
i was put through to command and they told me what to do.
they got to vass's apartment ahead of us and planted the evidence.
i tricked vass into running.
you think i wanted to do it?
i know my duty.
i'm the only one here who does.
you were played.
she's right, will.
but i wonder if miss keaton is so sure about me.
it was a secure command line.
what was i supposed to do?
do you believe her?
yeah.
i'm sure your people will come and find you, if you haven't outlived your usefulness.
after all this was over, what did you think they were gonna do with you?
all i've done is what they asked of me.
we're changing the deal.
we take qasim's wife back to london.
tell him he comes to the handover in person or he never sees her again.
let's go get her.
what happened to alexanderplatz?
sudden attack of agoraphobia.
i'm afraid there was a problem with qasim's wife.
at least be good enough to put her in my car.
harry.
colonel.
i hate to be ungentlemanly, but we're going to need your clothes.
as the manhunt for adem qasim intensifies, all passengers travelling on the uk's national rail network will have to show valid id and face on-board bag checks.
i have your wife.
so let me speak to her, then.
the russians have sedated her and...
bullshit.
i'm bringing her to london.
no.
i'll tell your whore you said goodbye.
was the baby thing too much?
no, it was very you.
i trusted june.
you were right to decommission me.
despite everything i've done, you're still here trying to do some good.
i won't let their sacrifice be in vain.
it was down there.
was it quick?
he could have given me up, but he chose not to.
you try anything, anything at all, i can't guarantee anyone's safety.
anyone's.
you bring my wife, i give you your phone number.
we're on.
hello?
holloway.
that message came from h branch.
i do.
we can get to qasim, but we need help.
call it in and we disappear.
one clean choice, hannah.
trust me and help me.
or walk away.
do good or do well, eh?
shit.
they're nearing position.
the self-perpetuating algorithm i wrote last night is constantly updating, revising all potential vantage points.
sudoku not cutting it, then?
please.
okay, we're here.
how long do we have?
i'm covering over 300 cameras.
give me something.
as soon as he realises we're playing him, he's gone.
wait.
it was working 30 seconds ago.
are you sure?
yes, confirmed.
camera's gone down in the last minute.
third level roof, east corner.
harry, we need to stall.
we have to assume he's looking directly at us.
yes?
you were told to be facing south.
i have his wife.
you were meant to face south.
give me the number.
give me the number now or we walk.
turn around now or i put you down.
there.
her, too.
i haven't gotten him yet.
you've got five seconds to turn around.
turn.
well, maybe this guy's never seen her.
i'm almost there.
is it her?
kill her.
give me the number.
don't!
stop!
no!
okay?
will, she's all right.
sniper's dead.
then it's over.
malcolm, make yourself scarce.
yes?
my wife's dead, isn't she?
harry, listen.
let hannah call us in.
harry?
hannah, why is harry off comms?
no idea.
call us in.
get sco19 here now.
four vans loaded with rdx leaving from limehouse north industrial park within the next 15 minutes.
how do you know that?
qasim just told me.
vans loaded with bombs leaving in 15 minutes.
i think we got him.
let's get going!
armed police!
stay where you are!
clear!
clear!
eyes on principal.
negative!
negative!
negative, sir.
command, we are clear.
harry.
he gave up his own men.
why would he do that?
what have you done?
armed police!
don't move!
go!
you need to tell them everything, harry.
i'd say we're due a catch-up.
might be a little over this one's head, though.
ever since the southwest corner of alexanderplatz.
keep holloway close by.
make sure he's secure.
perhaps we won't be so hasty.
have you found qasim?
harry will talk.
you still don't know him.
qasim gave up his entire operation.
what did you say to him?
i'd have thought they'd cut you loose after berlin.
they want to offer you a deal.
pin everything on harry and walk away.
i told them i'd do this, then i'm out.
"there is no ""out""."
i can't.
you have an emergency backup key on a chain around your neck.
whatever you're up to...
what would ruth think of it?
what did you give him?
check the back.
southwest corner.
i found harry on the northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
the opposite.
where you trap someone.
harry?
i gave him you.
stay down!
stay down!
stay down!
lock us down.
stay down!
stay down!
we're not here for you!
we're here for them.
you stay down!
think about your families.
hamza.
why?
there's 50 armed men the other side of those doors.
you should give yourselves up.
get here.
open it!
if you think we're going to negotiate...
open the door.
but he'll kill us.
there's so much evil in one room.
your only chance of getting out of here alive is to surrender...
do you think i want to get out?
how many people's lives began to end in this room?
my people's lives.
your people?
nobody asked you to speak for them, to kill for them.
if you want a hostage...
i think he's made it clear he's not interested in hostages.
i'm the director general of mi5.
kill me and then put down your gun.
otherwise you're just one more dead terrorist.
no one's going to see you as a hero.
by the time we've finished, you'll be a drunken, wife-beating, impotent kafir.
we'll wheel out a couple of marrakech rent boys, give them free tickets to disneyland in return for saying you begged them to piss on you.
can't have you being remembered well, can we, adem?
wait, wait, stop.
called off the helicopter.
but i...
you bloody coward.
i thought you fought to a higher standard.
i'm sorry, adem, about the loss of your wife.
i know what that can do to you.
is that supposed to stop me?
it's okay.
stop!
why did you bring him here?
i made a choice.
with no backup plan.
why do you think i kept you out of that room?
people are still dead, harry.
far fewer than would have died in the bombings.
how do you make a choice like that?
it's my job.
auntie g, can you come outside to play?
hello, geraldine.
in the end, it comes down to who can tell the best lie longest.
don't you think?
if we'd had cover that morning, qasim would never have got away.
you sent a secret directive to the met's air unit ordering them to decline all mi5 requests, didn't you?
that's the advantage of being a lone maniac.
i don't need to make it stick.
sacrificing your own service so it could be absorbed by a foreign power.
the americans would have made you director general, no doubt.
how many more lives was that promotion worth?
what was it you think you accomplished, harry?
the service is dying.
but if i'd given up the fight the moment i realised i was on the losing side, my career would have been a short one.
blow my brains out for my 10-year-old niece to find?
this came from you, i take it.
what is it?
perforates the small bowel over six hours or so, causing irreversible haemorrhaging.
leaves no trace.
how clever.
i was afraid that would be your answer.
that's why i've taken the decision out of your hands.
it's not your pub lunch that's making you queasy.
i had the rib of beef, too.
tell me you're lying, harry.
please.
tell me you didn't betray your country.
it's been four hours already, geraldine.
you can spend the last two in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd go and play with that beautiful niece of yours.
thinking about it.
your message said you had something to tell me.
they've put surveillance on ruth's grave.
you can't go there any more.
i have something which, by rights, should be yours.
your father was wearing it the night he died.
the stasi stripped his body of everything that could be useful and it found its way into an fsb archive somewhere.
he was wearing a wedding ring on the night of his op?
i didn't decommission you because you weren't good enough.
after your father, i couldn't...
i had to protect you.
the good ones tend not to last, will.
then who does?
the ones like me.
if you know your trouble, it would be helpful if you could tell the men at the door.
there's enough for every guest at hotel elementary school.
form up, single file.
this new trouble kills in complete darkness.
these people will be thanking you when night falls.
i guess we need to keep 'em here to keep 'em safe, but i just worry that it's only gonna go from bad to worse.
they have no idea who's causing the darkness trouble.
besides, it's not what hides in the dark we need to worry about.
still haven't figured out how to bring down that fog wall yet.
maybe that's a blessing.
that was the latest from in-flight safety.
listen, i'm in your neck of the woods, and... as it turns out, i may need a new job.
it's under control, but i'd love another pillow for my beauty sleep.
try to fix the troubles.
we've already talked about this.
it's almost impossible to remove a trouble without killing someone.
sure, i just need tools i don't have, materials that are impossible to get, and knowledge that might not exist.
gonna need a team.
any idea what's going on?
however, there's a bad element.
this is the only way to keep the rest of us safe.
and with the magnet trouble active, cars are risky too.
an engineer to help repair the power plant.
he volunteered as soon as he found out.
you can use her trouble to power the plant in case things go sideways.
what in the sam hill are you thinking?
the no marks killer's out there.
and i think, really, she just wanted to prove to you she genuinely wants to help.
okay, well, whatever the reason, just keep an eye on her for me, okay?
'cause she and i, we're not immune to these new troubles.
well, it's not just about her being my mom.
while you're gone, i'll just keep searching the school for the person with the darkness trouble.
he stole those batteries and endangered us all.
there was no other choice, dwight.
then that's three in two weeks.
and now the serial killer is in this building.
all right, well, i will go ahead and talk to dwight.
my dad always said you were a good guy.
mara's father.
there might be, but if you ask me to explain it, it'll just seem all the more daunting, so please don't.
"moreover, i can't even find a ""haven, maine,"" on a map."
you're telling me you can't find a town with 25,000 people?
this wasn't caused by troubles.
then why didn't we use aether to end the troubles from the start?
not with the thinnies sealed.
then how are we going to?
well, gloria brought over a box of stuff that duke left at the gull.
i can't believe that william had the amount i need, and... aether's just step one.
you told his wife that you would find him.
it's easy making choices from the sidelines, but sometimes, things aren't what they seem.
i got a town to protect.
no wonder the plant's working at 50%.
guys, i'll try, but remember, i've never done anything like this before.
i can't even pay for the oil change that they made me get to park here and talk to you.
if all goes well, i'll be back with some aether by sunset.
that's peggy's husband, rolf.
there's enough panic and fear as is.
the same person murdered my son 27 years ago?
"we're calling his murderer ""the no marks killer."""
what else are you keeping from me, vince?
dwight is doing his best to keep order to enforce the rules, but he doesn't have it in him to kill.
in this haven, banishment equals execution.
thanks to our friend there, we're keeping them in a... prison of sorts.
it says the generator's only operating at 40%.
damn it, the generator must have dumped its energy reserves when it overloaded.
well, that explains why the power's coming on in town one block at a time.
well, at this rate, five minutes or so.
so i'm kind of running out of these, and they're the only thing that are keeping the darkness from killing us.
there, i reconfigured the generator settings to get power to the town faster, but... that's the best i can do.
they better get back soon.
so help each other.
crowd around the lamps.
share supplies.
i'll put it this way, i'm happier here.
i, uh, got your call.
get in the damn car now.
now, come on, get in!
if war lies ahead, then we'll all be thankful for it... even slean.
i can't think of anything worse than being in love.
i don't like this place.
there are two sides to every story.
whoever's behind this is a man and a traitor.
let's go.
he asked i stand for him at slean's union with keela.
saray, you are my brother's love.
and so you are my sister.
you must have seen places much grander than this in the farlands.
none ruled by a woman.
you must each choose a second to be your companion and look after your interests during the rituals.
and you'll attend your binding of friends and kin.
i have no kin here.
my mother and others will join you.
keela, this is saray from bregan.
rheda, must i be guarded all the time?
i don't really understand such things.
but i do know that i must marry slean.
and i know i will come to love him.
this wedding cannot take place.
abrecan is counting on you.
what's your trade?
carpenters.
then they can use you on the wall.
who are you?
a friend of the reeve.
like i said, i've things to attend to.
have to re-think how we handle it.
varr said i can't accept gifts.
it'll be our secret, then.
all brides should smell sweet for their wedding.
but remember... it's our secret.
sit down.
we'll take what we came for while they're nursing sore heads.
you wanted to talk?
all right.
keela, it's time for your rituals.
elvina, will you be my second?
for the game.
we need to meet.
discuss any reasons the marriage shouldn't go ahead.
if we don't fulfil our duties, their union could be void.
beowulf!
let's celebrate.
in the old way!
oh, the cloth absorbs the smell.
i'm so sorry.
it was a mistake.
that's all.
we help slean retrieve the token to give to his bride.
sounds easy enough.
breca!
open the gate!
come on, you stinking mudborn.
come on!
come on!
gimme your arm.
come on!
slean.
quiet, keela's sleeping.
so are they ready for this marriage?
i see no season why slean shouldn't marry keela, do you?
no, i don't think it is.
he must put his own feelings aside and do what is best for all.
would you put aside what you want for the sake of others?
it's what we all must do.
if a man or a woman spends their whole life pleasing others, then they're not living at all.
it must be very liberating to think like that.
try it.
tell a truth at each stone.
only then can you look upon one another and light the fire signifying your union.
you will then be man and wife.
have you ever loved anyone?
no.
i thought before i came here that you would be...
do you want to be thane?
tell my uncle i am done with him.
go.
go!
get out!
you let her go.
we aren't done here.
don't you understand?
i've betrayed my mother, i've plotted with my uncle.
that woman was sent here to kill you!
i don't know.
don't i?
i killed my sister.
she is the one who should have been with you today.
even as the world turned to dust, mara had everything.
people loved he because she was kind.
my father loved her because she was first.
and she had rowan.
and then... the chance to escape.
to need for nothing.
she died of a fever.
she was recovering.
i poisoned her.
slean, i will never breathe a word of what you have done, of what happened here today.
or stay.
i know, but she is beowulf's.
he came to her bed last night.
but we can choose who we make our way through this world with.
light the fire with me.
you wish to be thane?
i can help you.
against whoever stands in your way.
they can't take it away from you now, rheda.
with this marriage, you are jarl of the shieldlands.
these laws of the jarl are to be obeyed by all tribes.
the life of a murderer will be forfeit, unless blood money is paid.
a common thief will be branded and cast out.
fixed prices on all goods traded in the shieldlands will be set by the jarl.
what right does she have to set the price of fish?
it is us who risk our lives each summer to catch the pandiri.
you should have told me about these laws.
you were where your people needed you the most... at the watch.
i could not disrupt you.
you were distracted enough.
the pandiri are late.
some think you missed them again.
but if you fail, bregan will have another poor, hungry winter.
breca's wanted for murder, you know it.
kill him!
kill breca now!
i'll do it!
do that here without any explanation and we're all dead.
he hired us to bring breca to law after he escaped the noose.
ask the man who helped him escape the first time?
so we'll overlook that.
but we must have breca.
herot could be moving against our gates as we speak!
when did we become the killer of young women?
what do you mean by that?
you have hid in the shadows for too long, abrecan.
remember who you are speaking to.
speak your piece.
the boy demands breca's life or blood money for the killing of his brother.
i didn't mean to kill anyone.
hurry up!
thank you.
breca swept my ma off her feet.
that's what he does... seeks out widows he thinks have coin and then he steals it and runs, this dirt-licker.
abandoned my mother and took off with everything of value she had.
so my brother pursued him.
and it cost him his life.
breca, is it true?
i'll pay the blood money for the boy's brother.
lila, do you even have 50 silver coins?
i don't want coin, i want blood!
silence!
the blood money is paid, breca will go free.
you lied to me.
pandiri.
pandiri!
tie it off quickly.
stand by, they're coming.
i saw them.
get out!
the council have been called.
harken wants to replace me because i've missed the pandiri!
you've failed me, slean's married keela, rheda is jarl!
you don't understand.
tell the council our enemies are gathering, that your sister cannot rule, that you want to save the shieldlands.
tell them that's why you've been distracted.
say it.
i'm sorry.
i knew breca had killed a man, but he spun me a different story.
it's nobody's fault but his.
lila, no one would think any less of you...
it's all i've got.
you have it?
this isn't 50 coins.
there's not enough.
and i'll hold him while he does.
there was enough coin?
lila?
leave this, beowulf, please.
you won't speak to lila.
you get on your horse, you leave herot, and you never come back.
you have no place here.
if herot's attacked, i wanna fight properly.
if herot's attacked, i'll protect you.
let's.
this isn't about mudborn.
i don't want to talk about him.
what i want to know is why you have to lie about training me.
well, it's wasted on you.
you don't even wanna be one.
is that so?
i didn't know we were training blacksmiths!
go.
now!
fighting girls now, is he?
and that looked more like the blacksmith was training the huskarla, from what i could see.
i know you think i have failed you.
that i have been distracted from my duties in bregan.
but there are reasons.
you speak treason against your own blood.
this land needs a warrior at its heart!
to bring its people out of the darkness.
a man of strength who will take control!
you talk of treachery against your sister to cover the simple fact you've failed to provide for your people.
what is the point of having fish if we are all to be slaughtered?
i stand here to place a vote of no confidence in our thane.
those who oppose abrecan as thane.
it is decided.
a new thane will be appointed and announced in the morning.
up.
next.
no one.
don't think this a game!
we've grown lazy, distracted.
and it ends here.
from now on, we will train as my father hrothgar did.
i didn't mean to interupt.
you're a good teacher.
a great thane needs a strong army behind him.
we don't have to share a bed, but if we don't share a room, people will talk.
i've always loved watching herot from up here.
it looks so invincible.
if i tell my mother the truth, i'll lose her trust.
and with it, any chance of ever ruling.
what if abrecan attacks?
herot could fall.
you offer no advice?
i trust you.
whatever you decide will be the right choice.
and when you make it, i'll be here.
you will be thane.
you just have to believe it.
pandiri.
pandiri!
it's the pandiri!
sound the horn!
i order you, sound the horn!
abrecan, leave it.
if we don't act now, our chance will be lost.
why...?
you there, you there, help me with the net.
help me with the nets, quickly.
why won't you help me?
pandiri!
hurry, hurry, go!
go and find me a sack.
people shouldn't leave their valuables lying around.
you owe my mother an apology.
but i'm a warrior and honour is at stake.
so i'll take your life instead.
go home to mummy, little girl.
hey there.
i didn't need your help!
because she didn't have enough money to save you!
be thankful you didn't kill him, vishka.
without the nets in place, the catch will be lost.
no, it's not.
be ready.
abrecan, no!
hold that rope steady.
quickly, they'll eat you alive!
pandiri, pandiri!
pandiri, pandiri!
hold it tight!
now tighten it up!
look at this.
a catch they will sing songs about.
a catch you brought in.
i have a vision for us.
to be the greatest tribe in all the shieldlands!
who won't follow laws set down by a jarl who can barely lift a sword.
who is with me?
abrecan, abrecan, abrecan!
i need to warn beowulf.
bregan!
elvina!
the war bands are coming together.
this time, they mean to destroy us.
beowulf!
if we look around the world today i would say that, by far, more danger, more harm comes from religious belief on every side than help.
and yet, she would be much less embarrassed if i was to have a stand-up row about soviet communism and about the atrocities committed by stalin.
that being so, any area of enquiry, especially something like philosophy, which gets so close to things that matter so much to people,
it's possible that some real mischief, some real harm might come from presenting a position which is in itself perfectly true.
when the prophecies don't come true... we laugh at those people and the world laughs with us at them.
i've had this friendly disagreement with richard dawkins over just this issue.
maybe we should get out there with richard and be more aggressive.
and, particularly in the united states where, in fact, it is very closely tied up with christian belief.
they're sure that the world is... what their religion says it is.
and we will smite the bad guys.
i'd love to write that book... if i could.
but, of course, what one fears is what comes afterwards.
and just how much disarray...
how right are the people who think that we need religion to preserve whatever... veneer of civilization and good feeling we have?
i think religion, for many people is sort of, you know... moral viagra.
well, if that's true, if religion does help people lead moral lives, then one should take very seriously the proposition that we're just going to eliminate it and let the devil take the hindmost.
because the hindmost may be great many people and we might have the chaos that these people fear.
a lot of people... many, many people they want their life to have a meaning, and where is it going to come from?
yes, but there must be something better than religion, i'm...
yes, we certainly hope there is.
what's it going to be?
sure.
well, at least you didn't get anything pierced.
i just don't know how i'm gonna explain this to amy.
i truly am the world's biggest idiot.
okay, it's official.
i truly am the world's biggest idiot.
okay, yeah, maybe you win.
i just can't find emma's paperwork.
well, honey, just so you know, even if you have the original receipt, you can't return a baby.
i need to find the paper that angela signed when she left emma on the doorstep giving me sole custody.
i'm finally getting health insurance for me and my dependents.
i haven't talked to her since the night i made her.
relax.
you gave me all important baby-related items for safekeeping.
you have all the papers?
daddy's little girl is becoming daddy's big girl.
i suggest something involving balloons.
nice look!
did you mug a clown?
it's your birthday!
well, first of all, it's tomorrow.
you used to have parties all the time when you were a kid.
well, i sorta stopped celebrating after, you know...
"""happy birthday, miley."""
you know those papers i was keeping for ben?
how irresponsible do you think i am?
i just, um...
may or may not have mailed them in on time and now ben may or may not have sole custody of emma.
there was all the excitement around the new baby and, you know, plus, i didn't have any stamps!
look, okay, we just need to get angela to resign this document and we'll be fine.
i thought since you're his best friend and you're the only one who's actually seen her...
which i enjoy, so i'm in.
all right, emma's finally asleep.
hey, danny, what's the deal with riley not wanting to celebrate her birthday?
seriously, why does she hate it so much?
ben, riley hasn't celebrated her birthday since her disastrous not-so-sweet 16.
are you sure you wanna see this?
and i think i'd remember if anything disastrous happened.
all right, come on, people.
danny, where are we going?
luckily the future, where you gain a real mustache and she loses a person.
is ben here?
benjamin wheeler, get over here and wish riley a happy birthday.
okay, so far this is definitely my best birthday ever.
do not tell me that you did something to that cake.
actually, try to save it with a perm first, then cut your losses.
is riley still in love with ben, or was that just something from back when they were kids?
unless of course, you're still in love with riley.
i ruined her sweet sixteen.
maybe not around her birthday, but the rest of the time, definitely a fan.
well, if ben is so irresponsible that he lost the papers and so immature that he couldn't face me himself, then maybe he's not responsible enough to have sole custody of emma.
if it makes you feel any better, we actually do a lot of the work.
i know how hard it must have been to give emma up the first time.
no matter how great or funny or amazing you thought it was going to be, at the end of the day, i knew you were gonna hurt her!
you have just witnessed the obliteration of an elite u.s. army tank force a mere three minutes after being engaged in the city's streets by the slave trooper 01.
also known as the madox-01, its localized combat capability is overwhelming.
furthermore, it can be deployed from a uh-60 blackhawk helicopter.
its utility for anti-terrorist and anti- guerrilla operations is self-evident.
"miss kusumoto is also in charge of soft- ware development for this ""tankbuster."""
in order to demonstrate the versatility of the madox she personally volunteered to be the driver today, despite being a woman.
unit #1 goes to ichigaya tonight.
we're in a hurry, so deliver it as-is.
and then...
miss kusumoto you humiliated me brilliantly today.
i didn't come to talk about that.
i have only one thing to tell you:
holy cow!
kouji...
what's this?
onose, i'll take charge of this!
it's just a piece of junk someone threw away.
i'm telling you, don't worry about it.
i treat you to ramen all the time, don't i?
how could an sdf transport...
the report said that it was an unavoidable...
it was terrorism, of course.
you people don't know the eastern bloc's methods.
you, too, should watch what you say!
another viewpoint is that this accident was one of your publicity stunts!
in any case, this couldn't come at a worse time.
we were just about to go into field-testing!
it's terrible!
i'll bring it down if it starts operating.
besides, madox-02 is being overhauled right now.
we're having trouble tracking down vehicles that were at the scene.
and we can't very well ask the police for assistance, now, can we?
we're preparing for the worst, and forming a recovery unit.
but after all, i'm the only one who's fought against the madox...
lt. kilgore is a dangerous man, but he's the best tank driver in the army.
say, will this be all right?
it won't drop through the floor, will it?
don't scare me like that!
shiori is too pretty for words.
when she goes off to study in england every guy in japan is going to be miserable!
how do you know about that?
she called this morning and asked me to give you a message.
to get inside press the open switch.
this is hot!
it can adjust to your body size.
feels just like wearing ski boots!
we've got the madox's activation signal.
this is a disaster.
can you warm it up in the microwave?
still, this is really embarrassing!
shiori, what do you want?
the self-defense forces?
taking off in a prototype airborne tank...
please don't turn tokyo into another vietnam!
tokyo or vietnam, it's all the same battlefield to me.
it'll be a catastrophe.
hey, don't worry.
i'll knock it out and keep this affair from escalating.
lt. kilgore has taken off on the madox recovery mission with a high-mobility airborne tank and anti-tank helicopters!
as it stands, the heart of the city will be in a huge panic.
it may be that nobody will be able to stop kilgore and the madox.
is there anything we can do?
the madox's goal is as yet unknown.
but if i can reach him before lt. kilgore does, i think we'll have a chance.
but, the madox is...
i'll take unit #0, from the motive-power test bed.
is there any chance of success?
come on, you heard me!
wait for me!
cool!
what a ride!
hey, what're you doing?
i don't put up with weirdos hogging the road!
you're really hot, man!
i still got 30 more loan payments to make!
it's a cabriolet now!
so long, suckers!
oh yeah, cars are not allowed in some areas of shinjuku on saturdays.
i can't cut loose in this crowd!
"this ""madox"" must really be important."
spider 1 to jackal 3.
it's still moving!
the right arm's moving on its own...
one of the apaches was shot down.
the full unit has authorization to destroy the madox!
that's just what kilgore wants.
it's heading towards the skyscrapers with the apaches in pursuit.
evacuate the civilians, quickly!
they're ganging up on me!
by going straight this way, i should come out at the west entrance.
another lunatic's popped up!
okay, move it, madox!
i can hear you.
you're giving me a headache!
you're the ones who are causing an uproar!
"""just..."" what?"
none of your business.
that's something i won't know if i don't try!
great!
all right, captain!
"sign: ""nsr building parking area -"
"exit elevator"""
all right!
shiori's up there!
i won't let you go any further!
damn it!
i don't want anything more to do with you!
i thought you were an amateur but it looks like i don't need to treat you like one anymore!
it's time we stopped playing around.
it can't be!
he's just a boy!
what do you hope to accomplish by this?
i'm sugimoto kouji, a sophomore at kanto institute of technology.
i just want to meet a girl who's waiting for me atop the nsr building.
it swallowed me up, and then it shot up a helicopter, all on its own!
i understand.
miss kusumoto, this is spider 1, kilgore here.
yeah, thanks for the show.
as always, you fought well.
i'll settle this personally with yokota base headquarters.
hey, where are the civilians in this building?
is it that important?
now that you mention it, why am i getting so frantic?
his target is the madox.
he'll come after you until he destroys it.
i barely know how to walk and move the hands!
you've got to do it!
either the madox gets destroyed, or you crush kilgore!
they wrecked my legs.
i can't move at all.
you think i can take him?
you were excellent in our fight.
have you read the entire manual?
welcome, madox.
bastard!
come on, try and kill me!
can't you let me enjoy this a little bit longer?
sh...
serves you right, you baby turtle, you!
if you can't even do that much you'll ruin the name of tankbuster!
that trick won't work on me!
kouji!
there you are!
you've got guts!
i'm not running away anymore!
you're strung up in a clever trap!
madox, i don't mind falling if you go with me!
both you and madox are out of your minds!
but i've got something i want to tell you after all, shiori.
paul wouldn't hurt anyone.
"e. r. ""beyond repair"""

what's your mom's name?
am i having some sort of reaction to the drugs?
but searching her room, that's such a violation of her privacy.
john, what would you say if i told you i asked the waitress at doc magoo's if she remembered weaver being paged the night we lost the marfan case?
i'd say that place is full of people with pagers.
where did he get those?
are you gonna keep the tickets?
somebody might come to claim the body.
abby, can you take a look at something?
what patient?
how's it going?
either that or you should find someone else to eat lunch with.

and they'll go and give this baby to some other vince and carol.

i told you i'd sort it, man.

yeah, he's all right.
i've got a little you can have, but don't tell anyone we were here!
you're gonna have half of that and you give me the rest back.
i can't believe you sold a fucking baby!
you didn't want it back before, did you?
if i go through all this stress, i lose my fucking money over it, everything, then you got to chat to someone proper, yeah?
nice lady.
"i'm like, ""how about fuck off?"" yeah?"
what's goin' on there?
you've been storing drugs in the pub, right?
either you or your idiot bredren have got my fucking gun and i need it back.
you've got two hours to get me my gun back or i'm gonna burn down people's houses.
i'm gone.
he's always spoiling things, isn't he, eh?
what you doin' bringing that fuckin' whore in my pub with my missus upstairs?
what's goin' on?
she was turning tricks with some heavy fucking russians who got her banged up.
she thought they were gonna kill the baby.
so she fucking left it on the train.
now here's the money and i'll give you the rest of it when i get in touch with ed.
it's not a fuckin' scam, vince, and you know it!
can't understand it without a cock in your mouth, can ya?
it's all right when it's your fuckin' cock in my mouth!
no, she said your cock in her mouth.
i ain't giving them the fucking baby back!
well, they ain't getting it either!

right, now you, get the fuck upstairs and get the baby!
here!
it's the bucky, bruv!
just know that he died... getting you this.
they might not let you cos you ain't family.
what flowers do you reckon he'd have liked?
white roses are nice, innit?
fuck you then!
fuck you!
are you the owner of this vehicle?
but you lot stopped me for no reason.
but not before we toast the new owner of the show, chester.
to chester.
i hope he will cherish these magnificent monsters as much as i have over these many years.
cheers.
i promise to uphold the standards of this extravaganza and do you proud.
safe travels to the land of make-believe.
good riddance.
i can't wait for the sour kraut to leave, so we can take over.
marjorie, that's not...
thank you, chester.
and now, if you don't mind, it's time for the original family-- our troupe of monsters and curiosities-- to spend these last few moments alone together.
bye.
we have another man to thank-- my manager,
mr. richard spencer.
he has transformed the course of all our lives.
cheers!
mm!
but first, tonight, we feast, and later, for entertainment, we will watch a movie from my own collection.
not the sign of the cross again!
no.
we will enjoy freaks.
do you know that picture, richard?
i can't say that i do.
oh, it's a wonderful picture.
explain the plot to him, eve, paul.
ah.
"cleopatra, a ""normal"" trapeze artist, marries the sideshow midget."
but actually, she's trying to poison him for his inheritance.
she plays all the freaks for fools until, one day, she gets drunk and reveals her true intentions.
then the freaks turn on her.
they take their revenge out at night with knives and guns.
eve, eve.
darling... don't spoil the ending for him.
well, it sounds like a hit!
so many things to do before we head out west.
i couldn't.
shut up and sit down.
you deserve this.
what's gotten into you?
come on, richard, open it.
i thought about you long and hard when i made this.
oh, thank goodness.
well, we have had our share of patrons who felt lightheaded at the sight of our exhibits, but... we have never had anyone faint before.
are you all right, young lady?
what happened to those security guards?
that's good to know.
now it's your turn.
jesus christ.
i don't even know who this is.
i already told them everything...
stanley.
elsa...
come on...
talk to them.
hollywood!
i'm afraid... that's all it is.
just a dream.
go ahead, spin him.
aah!
jesus...
no.
please.
my cousin works at the garden of allah.
but what you did you brought death into this place... and for that... you must pay.
take him down.
hurry, hurry.
elsa, come on, now... you and me must have a private conversation.
we can come to some kind of understanding.
so you think you can run?
i'm telling the truth.
she killed her.
she's not who you think she is!
and start running.
run!
run!
run!
just because you were raised without a father doesn't mean you get to romanticize him now that he's gone.
how did he die?
who killed him?
we all did.
he broke our code.
now, here.
come on.
he was my father!
he killed a freak!
the most vulnerable among us.
well, you're gonna take her word for it?
that deceitful little slut?
i saw my beloved ma petite in a jar with my own eyes.
i heard him confess with my own ears!
and as for maggie, we'd have a lot more corpses on our hand if she hadn't come clean.
i don't forgive.
she can rot in hell, for all i care.
seems to me like you need all the friends you can get right now.
maggie is going to change your bandages.
no!
i'll keep the dirty ones.
now, your mother is not here to look after you, so it falls to me.
i have seen you grow from a boy to a man, a man to a leader-- and we need you now.
i have no hands!
i can't even take a piss by myself!
i have found a old friend.
he's coming to help you.
he's a true artist.
but those wounds have to heal first.
maggie's going to help you.
you let her.
i'm sorry.
i hate hurting you.
oh, really?
i thought that was your whole gig-- to hurt people.
i love you, jimmy.
that part is real.
it always was.
i want a clean start.
we can still go to new york, like we planned.
why not?
you're kidding, right?
you think, after everything you've done, you think we're just gonna ride off into the sunset?
my hands... are in a goddamn jar, and that's all because of you.
i am so sorry.
you're gonna bring ma petite back from the dead?
hmm?
i've changed, jimmy.
ach!
i knew you were stupid, but let's add blind to the list, huh?
find me someone who can focus a lamp!
i have to stick around here.
i'm gonna have correct lighting for the first time, you understand?
now, try it again!
scheisse!
elsa.
of course.
she's watching us.
can we put her away?
just this once?
please?
all right.
yeah.
mm.
oh.
thank you, chester.
you put me on the floor.
like an old sock.
i'm sorry, marjorie.
i got a little... carried away, but i'm finally happy.
i've got them and my magic and you.
maybe i should leave.
we can work it out, marjorie.
the-the twins accept you.
they just don't want you watching us while we're, you know...
they're using you, chester.
you're the boss.
no, they are not.
they love me.
you're a murderer.
no, no.
no.
marjorie.
i know you don't like to talk about it, so i don't bring it up much, but you... killed them.
you killed alice and lucy.
that's impossible.
i'm a doll.
hmm.
love destroys you, chester.
you lose control.
well, i know...
i'm a monster.
you don't need them.
you have me.
i know.
just please don't ever leave me, marjorie.
those twins?
they have to go.
i know.
they will.
ethel looks so glamorous in this one with all her chorus girls.
oh, that was from her barnum days.
she really was a dame like no other.
to ethel.
to ethel.
what are you saying?
didn't any one hear what that creep spencer said last night?
it finally makes sense.
elsa killed ethel.
the woods.
the car crash.
it was all a cover-up.
i believe it.
she put a knife in my paul, that crazy, vindictive woman.
all elsa cares about is elsa.
the whole business never sat right with me.
i know ethel.
she wasn't a one to off herself.
she wasn't a coward.
she wouldn't have done that to her kid, and she wouldn't have done it to us.
and she would have bloody well left a note.
we know what we do when people come after one of our own.
there's only one way to secure our future.
make sure elsa doesn't have one.
did you ever imagine that it would feel like that, dot?
and thank goodness you said something about marjorie.
to his credit, all he needed was that little nudge.
i do seriously believe we're a good influence on him.
good evening girls.
what are you doing here?
i come hat in hand in friendship.
i have some relevant information about your current... situation.
we don't want to hear anything from you.
kindly leave.
oh, dot, i don't blame you.
i behaved like an absolute jackass that last day, when all seemed lost.
but recent events have softened some of my coarser edges.
mother died.
it was sudden and... just horrible.
i'm very sorry, dandy.
it's a big sorrow for anyone, losing their mother.
it was.
it is.
and it made me realize that i need to reach out to the few that matter to me.
i think you should know, we met a man.
truthfully, i'd already heard the news.
i can't tell you how sublime it would have been to have taken your hands in marriage.
if i had it all to do over again, believe me, i...
i come in friendship.
i'm well aware that i missed my chance.
i'm not half the man you deserve.
but i asked myself,
"""dandy, what could you do to be of support to those beloved girls?"""
and it occurred to me, the one thing i can offer is protection, so i hired a proper gumshoe, and gathered all the information i could on your new beau.
and it breaks my heart, but it appears your chester creb is an absolutely beastly sicko!
we don't need to see that.
what is wrong with you?
you are a troublemaker, and we don't trust you, not one single bit!
well, ta-ta, then.
i've done what i can.
mother always told me, never argue with a woman when she's angry.
who's there?
my boy.
here.
drink.
what's that?
penicillin.
i would hate to make you whole only to see you die of an infection.
who the hell are you?
i am massimo dolcefino.
i have come to make you your new hands, hmm?
okay?
massimo is an old friend of mine from before the war.
he's a master artisan.
no, thanks.
i seen those army guys who got their hands blown off by grenades.
they got those nifty hooks.
can't jerk off for shit with them, but at least i can hold a cigarette all myself.
and it beats worrying about termites the rest of my life.
what massimo offers is more elegant than a pair of rusty hooks.
and more convincing.
look.
you see?
the other one, too.
massimo saved my life.
your mother would have died in that drunk tank and you would have starved on the street.
i would have married him if you hadn't been such a fool.
"""my only sin..."""
si.
"""...was loving you..."""
too much.
no!
they were members of the party.
and they had a leader-- a doctor by trade.
_
for two years,
massimo took care of me.
he taught me to walk.
and then to dance.
then hindenburg died.
nuremberg, the rhineland...
it was time for us to get out while we still could.
we had a plan.
how could i look at my amore in the eyes knowing that i'd run away from those monsters?
they had to pay.
i hunted them down, one by one.
aah!
finally, i-i found the leader.
uh, the monster-in-chief.
dr. hans grouper.
i would make sure that he would not die quickly.
and i would not die quickly either, apparently.
he took my attempt to kill him personally.
very personally.
so he tortured me.
then he put me in a cell and he tortured me again, and again.
how did you survive?
so i spent the rest of the war in austria.
and, uh, i went to america in-in '47.
and i searched for miss mars for years.
but i did not hear back.
well, if you loved her so much, and you knew where she was, why not just sweep her off her feet?
my body survived the torture, but i...
i am like pinocchio.
i have no humanity left in me anymore.
but, uh...
sweet irony.
sweet irony.
nowi know you've been together for a long time and change can be difficult for an established show.
and again-- this is not about ego, all right?
this is about flow, so...
he looks so normal.
i thought we agreed that we wouldn't judge him until we had definitive proof.
what about the file?
it said he murdered his wife.
you're letting dandy's lies cloud your judgment.
dot and i have had a talk.
we don't care to be your assistant any longer.
why?
we just... don't wish to.
maybe you'll change your mind after you hear about my finale.
two bodies for two heads.
it'll be a sensation.
a first in the history of magic.
come on, girls... let's do a little rehearsal.
we are not getting into that box.
no, chester... we are not getting into that box.
now, if you'll excuse us...
i'll do it.
you...
i can be your assistant.
right.
get in the box, lucy.
my name's maggie.
oop!
is this your magic act?
it's a little pathetic.
shut up.
i didn't say anything.
what are you all looking at?
backstage.
originally called the magic saw.
tonight i will be presenting it to you with my own... dangerous variation.
manacles.
hey, i...
i don't-i don't know this part.
i went to a war for you.
you should have died over there.
we loved each other.
then you had to come back with your metal plate and your head full of bees.
chester, stop, i-i can't pull my my feet through!
stop...
stop talking.
you're distracting me.
stop it, marjorie.
haven't you done enough to ruin my life?
you're nothing without me.
i'll show you.
every one of you.
chester!
chester!
chester, stop!
what the bloody hell?
relax, folks... it's just a magic show.
it's a magic show.
i can put her back together.
i can put her...
alakazam!
abraca...
abracadabra.
that'll pack 'em in, chester.
she made me do it.
she had it coming.
what do we do now?
steal her jewelry and bury the bitch.
why are you packing?
you screwed up again.
time to leave.
you confused me.
you did this on purpose, to sabotage me.
i was finally happy.
i'm leaving!
not without me, you're not.
oh.
i loved you.
chester...
oh, god...
marjorie?
stay with me.
marjorie.
inhisdebutact as a juggler, please welcome your favorite lobster boy-- and my precious son--
jimmy darling!
i'm not a performer like you, ma.
listen to your ma.
you got a winning smile and a winsome way.
you got star quality, jimmy.
now you get your ass out there and you show 'em why your ma is so proud of you.
jimmy.
maggie's dead.
you want the details?
elsa's next.
tonight.
well... looks like... you get a shot at a normal life now.
jimmy...
i'm happy for you.
how dare you come in here unannounced.
what do you want?
you need to leave.
they have been plotting their revenge all day in ethel's caravan.
they're gonna kill you.
why should i believe you, huh?
my monsters love me.
i'm like their mother.
ethel was more a mother to them than you ever were.
you murdered their true mother.
rantings of a desperate man.
who's desperate now?
you saw what they did to him.
but where will i go?
anywhere but here.
you would save me.
now we're even.
there you are.
how's jimmy doin'?
he'd be here if he could.
it's time.
give me that.
ethel!
let's get our girl... some justice.
oh.
thank you for coming.
i never refuse a lady in distress.
i'm not in distress.
but i am in a rush.
oh.
i'd like to report a murder.
whose murder?
a young lady.
set it down.
slowly.
keep-keep your hands where i can see 'em.
i did it.
send me to the chair!
what are you doing here?
i'm here to take inventory.
i'm your new owner.
where's elsa?
she's gone.
off to follow her dreams.
elsa sold us again.
for $10,000 in cash.
a pittance.
everything here, including your contracts, belongs to me now.
and i want to see what's mine.
has it always been a dream of yours, sir?
to be in show business?
a dream.
yes.
and now it's come true.
i'm thirsty.
fetch me a lemonade with a paper straw.
right away, sir.
are you ready?
yes.
they're perfect.
i want to try them on now.
yes.
one more.
you do it.
thank you.
but jesse james gets away and goes into hiding for two years.
in the great plains, the united states military looks to defeat the armies of sitting bull and crazy horse and secure the gold in the black hills of south dakota.
but after they're defeated at the battle of little bighorn, the u.s. government sees the extermination of the buffalo as a way of starving the lakota nation into submission.
hold the line!
but despite winning small battles against the u.s. army, the struggles for the indians are only getting worse.
lakota leaders sitting bull and crazy horse are running out of options.
_
_
_
the native americans pressed on despite the violence and the decimation of their tribes and their culture.
this is just this moment of extreme opportunity to just go out there and strike it rich.
and a lot of men and women were able to do that.
as gold pours into the economy, the u.s. is the first country to pull itself out of the global depression.
the solution is found in the west.
there were lots of cattle in texas on the border of mexico for a long time.
but it wasn't until the railroads that they could be moved out to the plains and shipped from there to hungry people in the east.
cattle that would sell for ten dollars a head in texas are worth forty dollars a head on the east coast.
cattle barons buy up huge tracts of grazing land stretching from kansas to california.
those land grabs presented unbelievable opportunities.
we're talking about sometimes millions of acres, of these farms, and thousands and thousands of head of cattle.
and in the territory of new mexico, one cattle rustler will become one of the most notorious men in the west.
his story begins 2,000 miles to the east.
billy never knew his father.
in the early 1870s, he and his mother move to new mexico.
for years he wanders without direction.
what'll you have?
whiskey.
leave the bottle.
there were all kinds of cowboys.
always sat in the corner.
those are the ones you had to watch out for.
to get by, billy turns to the one thing he can do best.
billy the kid was superb with a gun.
he used every spare dollar he had to buy ammunition for practice.
and in those kinds of environment, the tough are the ones that survive.
where are ya headed?
into lincoln.
i'm just rounding up some strays.
those cattle you have belong to john tunstall.
well, then john tunstall can come and take them back himself.
be in your best interest to let me get on my way.
that's not how this works.
doesn't look like you have much of a choice.
young cattle thief billy the kid has just been captured by a local rancher he tried to steal from.
most men shoot cattle rustlers on the spot.
you still haven't told me who you're workin' for.
i don't work for anyone.
son, in lincoln county, everybody works for somebody.
yeah... well... not me.
you strike me as a man used to gettin' what he wants.
you got that right.
only thing about that is... so am i.
you got a lot of men.
you got room for one more?
when billy the kid came to lincoln, he needed a job.
john tunstall happened to need cowboys.
john henry tunstall has come to the west to make a fortune.
and he settles on lincoln county, where he can make a lot of money.
but with his success, he's upset some very powerful men.
lincoln was the wildest of the wild west.
"""the house"" controls everything from cattle prices, land holdings and government positions."
even the law is on their payroll.
in fact, a lot of people that lived in lincoln really looked at them as oppressors.
and john henry tunstall arrives to kind of horn in on the monopoly that the house has had for a long time.
there was no in between.
so, once billy accepted that job with john henry tunstall, he was gonna be tunstall's man.
over the next few months, the young outlaw becomes tunstall's most trusted gunslinger.
and for the first time, it feels like this orphan of the west has a home.
tunstall was a mentor to billy the kid.
put your plate over here, billy.
thanks.
i'm starved.
it doesn't get any better than this, son.
good to have you on board.
thank you.
if you think about it, billy had been scraping by.
he was looked at by most people as riffraff.
for a young man of billy's age, that was incredible, that was life-changing.
while billy the kid is now a part of the burgeoning cattle industry that's fueling america's growth... several hundred miles to tth, one man is doing everything he can to hold off western expansion.
easy, boys.
_
but the realit if he didn't do that, most of us wouldn't be here.
we would've died fighting instead of going to the reservation.
when they put us on the reservations, reay kinda took the spirit out of a lot of people.
he trusts in me.
he speaks through me.
the lord, the savior.
"it's a policy known as ""assimilation."""
but i think they wanted us to change to protect themselves.
they had a saying in the military...
"""kill the indian and save the man."""
which is, basically, to take his culture away and you'll be a better person.
they thought we were savages.
now the proud lakota warrior knows he needs to stand up for his people once again.
"""my people are not happy here."
"i am not happy here."""
"""we do not want to live here on this reservation."""
life on the reservation is not what you're accustomed to.
give it time.
i think you'll become quite fond of it.
but since pleading his case to u.s. authorities, the military now fears the lakota warrior could incite an indian uprising.
the u.s. was incredibly scared about crazy horse.
there's rumors going around th cra horse wants to kill a visiting u.s. general.
and u.s. authorities are forever concerned about these rumors of indian outbreaks.
as fear of crazy horse's intention spreads, the lakota warrior decides to meet with reservation agents to clear his name.
crazy horse thinks he's going to a meeting with some u.s. officials.
he doesn't realize the magnitude of what's about to happen.
they start to put him into a jail cell.
and he comes out with knives.
accounts here differ, but i think the most reliable interpretation is that the white u.s. sentry bayonets him, and he dies.
crazy horse is never killed in battle in that respect.
his vision is correct.
he's taken completely unawares when he's, um, surprised by the sentry.
on september 5, 1877, crazy horse, a man who fought his entire life to protect his people and won battle after battle against the united states army, is killed.
crazy horse's death is hard to talk about because it's just so... fresh, even though it's been that many years.
one of the things that's most fascinating about crazy horse and his legacy is simply the fact that of all the many native leaders across american history, he's one of the few people that most non-indians have heard about.
i think he's seen today as a symbol of courageous resistance to the u.s. government... and he is, in many respects.
and i think that's one of the reasons that makes him so powerful.
with crazy horse gone, the lakota people are in desperate need of leadership if they're going to save what's left of their culture.
until the house repaid catron, he had a stake in their well-being.
this is for you.
and what if he resists?
i don't care about the means.
just the results.
understood.
go check it out.
you stay here.
yeah.
what's the rush, boys?
we heard a shot.
did you, now?
don't do anything stupid, son.
this doesn't involve you.
i suggest you keep it that way.
this competition, this feuding between businesses, entrepreneurial interests is one thing.
like so many conflicts in the west, it becomes personal.
personal to the point where someone is murdered.
and that person is john henry tunstall.
he is murdered over a business dispute.
that's as personal as it gets.
john tunstall's death sets billy on a path to find his killers.
and it will turn him from an unknown gunman into a legend of the west.
as the country continues to expand, men like billy the kid are realizing just how lawless the frontier is.
but over 400 miles away from new mexico, one man is about to bring order to the west.
in the plains of kansas where men take what they want... and every day is a struggle for survival, no one is tougher... than wyatt earp.
he was large by 19th century standards.
he used that size to be imposing.
wyatt earp is one of thousands of americans who have flooded the west in hopes of striking it rich.
wyatt was bit by the incurable western disease.
and that was the need to always find the next frontier.
the frontier might be mining, it might be real estate, but it was the search itself, the adventure itself.
that's what really drove wyatt.
to get by, he's done nearly every job on the frontier.
from laying tracks for the union pacific railroad... to hunting buffalo on the plains and even working as a bouncer at a brothel.
to move cattle from wide-open plains to eastern cities, they must first be driven to railroad hubs that soon turn into bustling towns.
a boomtown explodes on the scene.
you had that barren landscape and then suddenly you would have a hotel with 50 rooms.
you have a lot of young men that would get to those towns and they're all fueled on whiskey, carrying guns.
so you've got young men drinking heavily and armed.
and this is, indeed, one of the reasons the west was wild.
wyatt sees that in dodge city the law is nonexistent and disputes are settled with violence.
it was a rough, tough life.
and they'd either go back east or they'd turn bad.
but wyatt earp feels he's destined for something more.
and it's in dodge city that he demonstrates a skill that will mark his place in history.
you cheated the wrong man.
that's my money.
the guy's a cheater, huh?
easy there.
he's a cheat.
easy there.
the guy cheated.
put the gun away.
his gun, did you see it?
everyone saw him reach for his gun.
just hand it over.
i'll shoot you!
come on.
the town of dodge is in desperate need of a lawman.
and wyatt earp is the perfect man for the job.
it isn't long before wyatt earp is recruited to be deputy marshal of dodge city.
there was no particular training for a lawman.
that's not how things work in this town.
wyatt earp didn't ask questions.
"""pistol-whip,"" that comes from him."
wyatt earp is quickly making a name for himself in dodge city.
and it's in his role as a lawman that he will soon become one of the most famous figures of the west.
because cartoon chickens give my father nightmares.
where've you been?
and that was irving berlin's white christmas,
the highest-grossing christmas song of all time.
what?
actually, irving berlin wrote over 1,200 songs.
oh, why don't you just marry him?
what's your problem?
i got no problem.
and you seem like the type that can write music.
what's that supposed to mean?
what do you got goin' on this holiday season?
oh, hey, babe.
where you goin'?
oh, father melley called.
i gotta guard the nativity scene down at the church.
i have to make something for the bake sale.
you don't hear me complaining.
"what rhymes with ""poinsettia""?"
i lost it again!
you are impossible!
i can't create in a hostile environment!
well, i wouldn't be so hostile if you had one ounce of talent!
you kick me again, i'm leaving.
your calves are spindly.
what's up?
so i brought you some soup and your heavy jacket.
yeah, i'll just give her a call, see what she's doin'.
it's hopelessly generic!
it's pap!
course not, because we're not saying anything
yeah, and, you know, i'm 1/8th jewish.
sweet.
i'm gonna grab a bagel and a schmear.
i'm headin' back to the manger.
uh, a phone call to shanghai gardens.
but whatever i decide, it gon' be good.
i only have 3 days to make cake.
she doesn't actually sound like that, but whatever.
thud.
i was gonna make one, but i had to work late and i'm exhausted,
so, thank ya...
hungarian bakery.
says who?
well, i know larry's wife isn't.
she's makin' a volcano cake.
do you know what that is?
any chance you're gonna be in that village?
that i actually thought you were gonna make this cake.
i'm not whitefish?
oh, 'cause he'd never be with you, because you know what?
he'd have to get his own pepsi!
stop it.
fantastic.
guess i was just bein' naive.
what are you doin'?
looks like you started.
like a food processor and big spoons!
let me think.
a nice, easy cake recipe.
hey, how 'bout that, uh, chocolate crumbly thing?
hey, well, at least i can match my pants and my shirt-
a monkey could make it.
i love you.
i love you.
am i dreaming that we're giants?
nope.
well, you shoulda put more baking powder in there!
you have no idea how much a pinch is!
and nobody's gonna want to buy this stupid doll cake!
we'll bring the covered cake plate to the bake sale.
ok.
my calves are smaller than ever.
come here, you!
and it's not?
after all that prep work?
anyway, try the punch.
it's divine.
oh, no problem.
we don't do the traditional bake sale here.
we do something much more fun.
all righty.
great plan.
i didn't count on a cake walk.
i've never seen caramel do that.
this is a chocolate frosted couch pillow!
come on.
hey, ling.
i'm having your mental problem.
well, whenever i...
elaine?
oh, never mind.
i see him moving in slow motion.
how long has this been going on?
what does this mean?
i think you're in love.
well, how do i snap out of it?
i got myself together
yeah, now i'm ready to sing
i've been searching my soul tonight
i know there's so much more to life
thank you for seeing me.
how may i help you?
my wife, cindy, passed away two years ago.
we'd been married three years.
she was hit by a car on our anniversary.
cindy and i dreamed of having children together.
the first being she's dead.
how would you go about...?
did she leave her eggs or embryos?
no.
did you hear me?
i did.
to clone your dead wife?
scientists are already secretly trying this, mr. cage.
and i had prepared to covertly attempt it with cindy.
my sister-in-law has hired a lawyer to get an injunction.
that's why i need a lawyer.
she's going in today.
yes, but mr. stoller, i must tell you i'm sure your wife was a very nice woman.
but the idea of cloning?
please.
i have nowhere else to turn.
and your firm has opposed this lawyer before.
who is it?
larry paul.
i am told he's quite good.
it was.
how can you date a guy online?
a relationship is communication.
"what about ""it""?"
i know you don't like it but a woman gets control when her hand's on the dumbstick.
it's all about control with you.
i don't know.
really?
and you came in here to talk about my computer date?
i came in here to borrow some products.
but just forget it.
ally!
a second, please?
and larry is opposing counsel.
he is?
i have a little conflict of interest there, don't you think?
your duty does lie with the client.
yeah, but...
you didn't use a little inside information when you opposed him?
no, but i...
then why can't i?
it's for the client.
my case falls deeply short on merits.
i need something.
with larry, it's all about rhythm.
he sucks me into this fast patter because he figures i won't spot what i'm about to step into.
okay.
he's vulnerable without his rhythm.
okay.
in your dreams with me, cindy margolis.
michelle garris e-mailed me and asked  for advice on breaking into tinseltown.
we met in hollywood at...
just do it.
no, i won't be used!
we can't deny our passions anymore.
you want me, and i want you.
so let's just be honest.
you do my knee, and i'll give you hair.
you're pinching my spinal cord.
don't like denial?
let's be honest then.
gotta go.
i went to l.a. and hardly ever thought about you.
all you think about is jackson.
people accuse me of being shallow?
but i understand human behavior when it comes to relationships.
in our last month, you shaved your legs in the morning.
this is your treatise?
when the woman shaves in the morning instead of at night, it's over.
no exceptions.
so go to jackson.
he's the man you lather up for.
cloning humans is against public policy...
it's never come before the courts.
people are against cloning sheep...
that can't sway the court.
you never let me get to second...
"""second"" is a sexual idiom."
i take full exception.
if i could briefly get back to the sheep.
there is no place for that in court.
move for verdict, forthwith.
forthwith?
let's hear what mr. paul has to say.
second of all, and forgive the vulgarity...
mockery.
...even if you could clone her, that's not a choice for mr. stoller to make.
it is too.
"i anticipated a lot of case law but i find myself totally unprepared for, ""it is too."""
three times he mocks me.
move for an apology in writing, preferably notarized.
four times.
is this cloning even possible?
first, i want to hear from your client and why he wants to do this.
your honor, i'd also expect to be able to call...
till tomorrow?
till then.
ling is in denial that she even wants him.
how do you feel about it?
she can have him.
he runs as deep as an inkwell.
which means, i suppose, ling might drown.
are you really okay?
yeah.
as a matter of fact, i was up against john cage.
did you know that?
how did it go?
you're against smiling on principle.
what's going on?
don't ask me.
john asked me for a few tips on how to oppose you in court so i said to break your rhythm.
since you're useless without it.
cute, but useless.
you gave him advice?
his client is my client.
we sleep together.
you go behind my back.
you're giving him tips when you can't beat me yourself?
does he know you could never beat me?
excuse me?
does john know you've never beaten me?
no, no, no.
never?
you like her smile?
adorable.
not only am i gonna beat you one day, but john is gonna beat you here.
excellent.
i'll lose my edge.
no, you won't.
now he knows i'm trying to offset his rhythm.
he said that you could never beat him.
not on this case or any case.
oh, he did?
yes.
i bet him, john.
he said that i could never beat him?
yep.
never?
never.
indeed.
i could date a man in paris.
you can run as far away from here as you like.
i'm not getting you online.
i am not.
how was i?
larry.
what brings you here?
i thought john and i could walk together.
to fiddle with my psyche, and i won't be fiddled with.
i saw the smirk.
it was unsupportive.
is everything okay, john?
because you seem a little uneasy.
he just tried to one-up me, and i don't go for that.
okay.
you feel like having lunch?
i would love to.
i'm booked today, but how about tomorrow?
great.
we always talked of having kids.
i guess i just want those dreams, mine and cindy's, fulfilled.
but you're not talking about having cindy's child.
you want to clone her.
my only means of carrying on her genetic legacy is cloning.
many people, including mr. paul, as he sits so dismissively...
your honor, i'd like to stand dismissively.
mr. paul, sit.
mr. cage, don't antagonize him.
many people find the idea of cloning people to be repugnant.
but i'm not some scientist trying to perfect the species.
and i know i can't bring cindy back.
i'm looking to give rise to the next generation.
and i suppose i don't want her extinguished.
thank you, sir.
first, i sympathize with your loss.
but you are trying to replicate cindy, aren't you?
it's creating a human with the exact genetic makeup as your late wife.
she'll look the same...
did cindy ever mention genetically engineered fruit?
she was against it.
engineered chickens?
against it.
but she'd be open to the idea of a genetically engineered clone?
it's not the same thing!
not everything is like chicken, counsel.
i didn't say that.
i have enough pressure without you...
you've never let anybody get your number.
you have to find out again what makes you great!
i think maybe melanie just scared him off.
john, i'm sorry, man.
but remember, larry said you will never beat him.
not ever.
now you have to dig deep.
because i am not rubbing his feet.
now whatever it takes, you find barry white.
yeah.
yeah.
come on.
we got it together, baby.
does ally know?
it doesn't help when i feel pressure.
could you excuse me?
sure.
just you and me.
oh, balls.
how does this cloning work?
oh, it's fascinating.
we harvest eggs from donors who we inject with fertility drugs.
we then take cells from the cloning candidate, cindy stoller.
oh, here's where it gets fascinating.
"the witness previously said it was ""fascinating."""
it's just now fascinating?
then we suck the nucleus out of each egg with a needle.
lots of needles in cloning.
we take the sucked-out dna-free eggs and place them with the donor cells.
in this case, cindy's.
and we zap them.
what do you mean?
we fire off a jolt, kind of like...
i'm trying to get an idea.
you're planting the idea that it's like killing bugs and i find it gross, even for an ombudsman.
let's proceed.
you're both losing points with me.
what happens to the cells after you zap them?
when we zap the donor cells in the dna-free cells they fuse together.
we then plant them in the surrogate mother and what may result is a cloned baby.
semen?
no, it's fascinating!
is it really possible?
most of the embryos die off, i grant you that.
but it is entirely possible that one will make it through.
we've already done it with sheep.
it's feasible with humans.
how far away is this?
it's here now.
man is not waiting for science here.
science is waiting for man.
thank you.
hey, mark.
if you need anything, have your assistant call.
i don't see you in slow motion anymore, you lying weasel.
i still see you in slow motion.
some other time.
what's up?
i'll explain over lunch.
bygones.
what is with you?
what's with me?
i completely threw myself at you.
i launched myself out of a cannon.
do you know how huge that is for me?
i gave you a gesture.
i told you i was in love with you.
anybody could share a stupid feeling.
please?
i've asked for so little.
it comes down to closing arguments, and i need you with me.
together we can beat larry.
nobody but you and me.
come on!
you're at the end of your career.
what else do you have to do?
you're here?
you're here!
this is why i start every day with a bran muffin.
he was here.
who?
barry white came.
forgive me if i don't try to envision that.
it's my concentration.
it's not what it used to be.
i can't get him if there are other people in the room.
most can't dance with imaginary disco behemoths in front of others.
i could always get him.
i could walk down a crowded street with him.
no, this is what you need to do.
get him alone, in your hole.
once you've got him there solid step out and try keeping him there with other people around.
i don't know if i can.
you have to.
without barry, what are you?
look at that.
you can't go through life as that.
you have no choice but to find barry.
they'd be taking her individuality, her dna.
your brother-in-law loved your sister.
with permission, i'd like to buzz my objections.
he wouldn't bring her back.
as it's been said identical twins share dna, but they're different people.
but before we take organs from a person, they have to give consent.
and this is more invasive, to duplicate someone's dna.
it does go to their individuality.
i apologize.
was that mine?
i did not mean to hit it.
it was my mistake.
well, wouldn't you want to see your sister's genes carried on?
it would look like her, sound like her.
any chance she'd be in favor?
she was conflicted about genetic research to begin with.
she would have never wanted this.
never.
but you have a computer.
i'd like a little privacy.
he's from brazil.
this will be our first meaningful conversation.
i've got a really good feeling about him.
hurry up.
i'm the one who'll have to rub his feet.
did you find barry white?
any sign of him?
never mind.
can't find your office?
well, yours is closer to court, and my feet are a little achy.
haven't a clue.
elaine!
one thing led to another.
could you stop following me?
is that what i'm doing?
i didn't mean to blow you off.
i thought you weren't interested.
you were right.
deja vu bygones.
you have been angry ever since i came to this firm.
i'm angry because you lied to me.
and because i went to bed with you.
it's hard to walk around peppy all the time.
it's hard to be the cheerleader.
i wonder how you do that every day.
it's obvious that we're both a little bit ashamed of how we began.
so why don't we just begin again?
you could be right.
or wrong.
jackson.
how are you?
can't complain.
we've definitely got our thing together, don 't we?
he's on to something.
yes, he is.
nobody but you and me
he's a funny little man, isn't he?
it's not a problem for me.
it's about time.
it sounds like dr. frankenstein.
the idea of harvesting body parts?
selecting dna?
it's horrifying.
we could have hockey teams filled with wayne gretzky clones.
they might cross a pit bull with mike tyson.
the possibilities.
the horror.
but the truth is every time science is advanced, it raises concerns over the future of humanity.
we already do in vitro work, your honor.
we manipulate genes.
this technology could save lives.
now, is there a risk of abuse?
absolutely.
my client knows the wishes and dreams of his wife.
dreams they had together.
cloning will allow them to carry on the family legacy they hoped for.
we have to be open to a science that will allow a couple to have a child.
the question can't be who owns her dna, can it?
and i remind mr. paul that a surviving spouse is free to donate organs without consent.
i say this in case he was gonna incorrectly detour into the actual wishes of mrs. stoller.
no reason to believe he would have.
you never know when to speak around here.
it's your turn now.
i might not have a legal reason.
but i have an ethical compass.
that's what this is.
i mean, why stop there?
he could clone his mother.
his grandfather.
his kids might get to play in a sandbox with the twin of their great-grandmother.
celebrities might start selling off their dna.
imagine being able to parent barry white's identical twin brother.
when technology begins to take over reproduction when it starts to invade evolution it's been crossed.
there was a time we were appalled by heart transplants.
the idea of a test-tube baby was considered aberrant.
now it's reality, and the public accepts it.
there's a movement to clone organs to save lives, wipe out disease.
that too may become a reality.
but to clone a human being to duplicate somebody's dna, to harvest an exact match of a person?
we're adjourned.
i'm sorry.
i appreciate the effort.
i don't want a rematch.
hey.
hey.
so do you come here often?
that's my opening line.
it's a terrible opening line.
has it ever worked before?
better.
want to go to the bar?
not tonight.
because you lost to larry?
it isn't that.
truth be told, i didn't really want to win this one.
no, i just want to be alone tonight.
alone with him.
it isn't that.
like you say, most people don't dance with imaginary disco behemoths.
you're not crazy.
the truth is, i'm a little jealous.
to conjure something up when the real world disappoints.
hey.
maybe the three of us could go.
you know, give it a try.
if he doesn't, well, i mean, you still got me.
well, that i do.
let's go.
who knew karaoke night would turn into the hottest party on the strip?
you karaoke'd with p. diddy and kissinger?
"let me tell you, ""islands in the stream"" never sounded so good."
uh, the limo driver just called and he said that, uh,
"a multimillion-dollar, ""put donald trump's wedding to shame"" wedding?"
sam, i've been in vegas for almost 30 minutes, and i've yet to play a single hand of blackjack.
oh, well, your favorite table's ready.
ladies love a good karaoke singer, danny.
call me.
are you saying you think you can get any woman you want?
get her.
solo mission, my friend.
she's here for the born-again virgins convention.
girls who aren't technically virgins have a change of heart.
card counters have hit two of the strip hotels this month, and the last shift report shows big losses in the blackjack pits.
there is a card counter on the floor.
ed thinks we may have a card counter.
maybe we should continue this conversation later, say, over a drink?
patty, this is the third time, and you've only been here a week.
i'm behind on my rent, and the only reason my landlord is letting me stay-
listen, i feel for you, girl, but i'm trying to run a business.
if i have to pay for every shirt you ruin, it's gonna break me.
okay, the gift bags are assembled and waiting to be delivered to the guest rooms.
our florist has cornered the world market on phalaenopsis orchids, and the last 1,000 stems are due to arrive tomorrow.
however, if for some reason they do not, i have a shipment of tulips ready to leave amsterdam-
mary, don't worry about it.
i'm sure everything's gonna be fine.
you're, like, the most relaxed bride i've ever seen.
thanks for coming over, galina.
so, this is what a hundred grand worth of dress looks like.
hundred thousand dollars?
like i said, it's all new to me.
his take alone could account for our elevated losses.
betting patterns don't suggest it.
card counter sits at a table and only bets big when he's determined the deck is rich, right?
suspicious female, red hair, gold top, heading for the west exit.
thank you.
mr. sperreos, i'm with casino security.
kind of a rhetorical question.
we're not even married yet, and already you're staying out the whole night.
doesn't bode well.
honey, i am on a roll here.
we're done for the night, and so are you.
all right.
you know, i told donald trump that our wedding... would make his little palm beach shindig look like hot wings and schlitz by comparison.
well, if anyone can trump trump- our staff has been working for months to make sure... that your wedding is the grandest, most elegant affair this town has ever seen.
come on.
even when she was a secretary, she was always the boss.
why are you still such a hopeless romantic?
so while your commission might be affected by the fact that he stopped playing, the montecito will still come out way ahead, which is all i care about.
let's go, people.
the guy in the bolo tie did say something about asking us to turn down the air conditioning a dozen times.
could signal a count of plus twelve, which means the deck is rich.
she's been sitting at that slot machine all night, but barely plays.
and her eyes don't leave the blackjack pit.
about a minute before sperreos enters a game, she gets up and cheers like she's just won a jackpot.
you can't prove anything.
and even if i was counting, it's not illegal.
see, that is technically correct.
but, see, here in vegas, we have a different kind of a justice system.
like in the old days, we could take a cheat and have him disappear in the desert.
to be honest with you, i'm an old school kind of a guy.
please.
see, now that we have your picture, it's in the black book.
if you set foot anywhere in the montecito property, i will personally have you arrested.
you hear me?
hey, jack!
here's a guy who beats us out of 300,000.
well, you know as well as i do counting's not illegal... unless you got a mechanical device, which he didn't.
at least we got to have a little fun with him.
it's not the end of the story.
now, if someone is bankrolling 'em, schooling 'em, it's not the end of anything.
it's mike from last night at mystique.
the guy who's not from phoenix.
you know, there's so many other cities i'm not from.
des moines, for example.
fascinating as this is, i really have to go.
i'm crashing and burning, aren't i?
finally, you've said something i can relate to.
i think it must be something about you, 'cause usually i'm quite charming.
well, what?
well, it could be that you're just so beautiful, i get a little nervous around you.
tongue-tied.
you know what we need to do here?
what's that?
we need to sit down, have a drink and figure out why this isn't working between us.
patty.
that was close.
did they say i was good?
whether you were good is irrelevant.
i should fire you.
please.
thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
the seamstress said she had it sent back here this morning, but the bell desk doesn't have any record of it ever arriving.
we have over 400 people arriving for this wedding tomorrow- heads of state, captains of industry, oprah.
do you wanna tell oprah that the wedding's been canceled, that she came to las vegas for nothing?
and if we don't, the montecito will be happy to get you another one just like it.
that dress is a one-of-a-kind couture creation.
it took a dozen french ladies a year to sew the beads on by hand.
there's no other one like it.
do you know how much that dress cost me?
this is a big problem, sam.
whoa, whoa.
hey, danny, you wanted me to look out for big blackjack winners?
the montecito's already laid out almost a million dollars in food, flowers, decor, entertainment.
if this wedding doesn't happen as scheduled and lipworth refuses to pay-
you guys really think someone stole that dress?
what's the street value on something like that?
what about that seamstress galina?
as soon as she found out how much that dress cost, she was real interested.
mike.
hey.
you let me know how that goes.
so, this crew was using the same techniques that, uh, sperreos and his crew were using?
we catch one team, they send another within a few hours.
if we don't find out who's behind this, we might as well open up the vault and let people carry cash out the front door.
you better start talking to me now, you little rat bastard.
you been talking to sperreos?
i also know you better take your hands off me, because defending their president against an assault charge... will cost the montecito a hell of a lot more than i could ever win playing blackjack.
that was good.
you think i take this dress?
i just wanna know what happened.
i do the alterations, give the dress back to montecito messenger.
you have surveillance cameras in your shop?
i sew real diamonds on costume for elton john.
compared to that, this dress worth nothing.
galina protects galina.
you're free to go.
i'm trying to help you, patty.
lord knows why i take on these projects.
i've always been the one to try to save the baby bird even though i know it might have rabies.
oh, well, then, let me go and get my tray.
that's christina, one of our best waitresses.
knees bent, back straight.
but more than anything, it's about confidence.
confidence.
tray full of martinis with their high center of gravity.
the hardest drink to carry.
she never even looks at the glasses.
she simply trusts in her ability to do it right, and voilà.
very zen.
you- not so zen.
just breathe with me, patty.
be the booze, patty.
so you just want me to sit here being until mystique opens?
well, just be glad i didn't make you wax the cars in the parking lot karate kid style.
just call me sensei.
vic, this morning, you sent over one of your guys to pick up a dress at the forum shops.
yeah.
do you remember who you sent?
the seamstress gave me a surveillance video, but i couldn't make out the messenger's face.
bart, you went on a run to pick up a dress this morning to the forum shops?
nah, i never made that run.
why not?
i was on my way out the door when joey c. stopped me, volunteered to go himself.
pull up videoiq on joey c. and get his address for me.
thanks.
flower delivery.
wild caspian sea caviar.
why would he have her cash in his chips?
did you hear anything about the dress?
yeah, it's candy.
who's candy?
not me, 'cause i know prostitution's illegal in clark county, but some of the other hosts, they like to call candy.
you know where we might be able to find candy?
danny mccoy, montecito surveillance and security.
how do you know nick sperreos?
cops don't scare me.
okay, wait, wait, wait.
fine, fine, fine.
that's it.
all right, i know nick.
he came in here a few times with his friends.
well, are any of these his friends?
recognize any of them?
yeah, i think so.
nick's a good kid.
one time, he asked me to meet him in the casino to cash in chips for him.
well, i guess he figured a girl like me wouldn't arouse suspicion.
strippers get tipped with chips all the time.
look, all i know is it's great money for five minutes work, and i don't have to take my clothes off.
why do you care anyway?
'cause sperreos and his partners might be involved in some kind of a card-counting ring.
i just figured they were a bunch of rich kids.
kind of quirky, but- somebody's behind this, and i need to find out who.
you have any idea who might be training these people, bankrolling 'em?
one time, they came in here with an older guy.
"yeah, they called him ""bucky."""
mitch, you got that videoiq footage of joey c?
play it back fast-forward.
someone's paying him off.
can you widen the image, see who it is?
uh, no, but i can bring up another angle.
you mean, like, lipworth's fiancée lissy?
we need to talk.
but i think you already know that, don't you?
i know that you paid the bellman to get rid of your dress.
what i cannot figure out is why?
this wedding, the details, the excess, the cost-
listen.
if you wanna leave the guy, i think it's kind of a strange way to do it.
well, that's the thing.
i don't know if i wanna leave him.
i love him, but- but his life-
i mean, how many of those 400 guests do you think are my friends?
people always say this is a cinderella story.
i'm not cinderella.
i'm just a regular girl from bayonne, new jersey.
and i may not know much, but i know that having a wedding that costs 10 times the amount of my parents' house-
that isn't right.
right.
jared and i are so different.
i mean, what harm can it do?
how old do you think these kids are?
none of them look older than 21, 22.
danny, i got those yearbooks you asked for.
we'll see.
we know that they're all in their mid-20s and they all have the mathematical ability to count cards, right?
so they might have been recruited from some college math department like those m.i.t. guys back in the '90s.
then i remembered, what ultimately brought that m.i.t. crew down?
given how quickly the second team arrived, i thought i would start with local universities first.
'cause you seem like an amazing guy, and i tend to have an affinity for the less amazing ones.
well, maybe it's time for a change.
listen, mike, before this goes any further, there's something i should tell you.
i'm here in vegas for a renewed virginity convention.
renewed-
so i've just made a lot of bad decisions with men in the past, so i decided clean slate time, and i made a vow of chastity until i get married.
i mean, just because i've given my gift before doesn't mean it's any less precious.
the registrar lady sure was nice.
good.
what's up?
you ever think about going back to school?
you know, i'd go back, get me an anthropology degree, go down to the rain forest and, uh, study indigenous people.
you're an idiot.
what's up, ruben?
if you touch me, i'll- i'll call my lawyer so fast, it'll make your head spin.
you'll call your lawyer?
what do you want?
where's bucky?
i don't know what you're talking about.
we have surveillance footage of you robbing and cheating the montecito.
i don't think these graduate schools take too kindly to that kind of thing.
i make one call to the admissions office at caltech, you can kiss your future good-bye.
please, don't tell my parents.
hey.
hey.
you ever hear of a born-again virgin?
so this whole time, you knew?
i'm sorry, but all that boasting about how you can get any girl you wanted was getting pretty insufferable.
yes, i set you up... with a beautiful, sweet girl.
and you're just gonna let that go 'cause she wouldn't sleep with you.
hey, where are you going?
hi, mike.
probably won't even need you.
hey.
i acted like a complete idiot.
i guess i just needed some time to process all of this.
you think you could find it in your heart to give me a second chance?
is that room service with the whipped cream, babe?
excuse me?
"what was all that stuff about your ""precious gift""?"
'cause, see, to me, this looks like christmas morning with wrapping paper tore up all over the floor.
look, i've been born-again, like, five or six times now.
so why would you with him and not me?
i've been trying to change.
so this is my fault?
i'm really sorry.
well, i took your advice.
i talked to jared, told him everything.
the wedding's off.
i said the wedding's off, not the marriage.
bucky trains his crew here?
hey, ruben, you try anything funny, i got your parents on speed-dial.
bucky.
mr. buckner?
you know this guy?
he was my high school math teacher.
well, i'm head of surveillance and security at the montecito.
yeah.
you remember mrs. buckner?
last year, she ran off with coach kajoyan.
alimony payments are killing me.
i got night school debts.
but, uh, tax evasion is.
you guys won a lot of money in a lot of casinos.
i'm willing to bet somewhere along the way... some of that money wasn't reported to the i.r.s.
look, you keep all these card counters out of the montecito, we'll let this whole thing go.
but before any one of these kids leaves, danny has to get their picture and information.
what was that dish there on the left?
oh, my god.
so did you miss the flowers, the caviar, the oprah?
you know i didn't really care about any of that stuff.
the only thing that matters to me is spending the rest of my life with you.
delinda, i'm so sorry.
he has got to hear you sing, honey.
i'm gonna make you a star.
i hope you wrote that down somewhere.
be careful, we're coming in.
do i know you?
vinny, he, uh, he's hanging out with your mother.
do you really wanna risk your life for a skirt and a geezer?
any sign of the professor?
i speak six languages, why...
stein's about to kill sara in the library.
somehow, the speedster's disguised himself as stein, and he's turning over the whole ship.
since when do you call him jax?
unfortunately for you, the effects are only temporary.
what did you do with stein?
capone's men are taking over the ship.
you're here because i killed that moronic leader of the jsa.
mr. rex tyler was it?
i don't wanna be here all night.
aw, you're welcome, you drunken maniacs.
my job is much better, big guy.
you know what i do, is i'm in charge of this entire arena.
every night, 17,505 people come here expecting to have a good time, and i make sure they do.
are you one of the players?
yeah.
right.
well, you tell springsteen that i'm the boss of this arena.
don't tell him that.
tell him he gets whatever he wants.
have you seen a really hot marketing executive anywhere?
where you been, dude?
i got a meeting after the game.
how much time do we have?
8 minutes, 13 seconds.
i can get a lot done in 8 minutes and 13 seconds.
she's a funny girl.
i'm seeing other people.
i'm seeing other people, too.
happy birthday, ben.
how do you know that?
morning.
okay.
happy birthday, ben.
hey, you're the head maintenance guy, right?
two years ago, you told me you only wanted to hear me say yes.
it's tricky because you don't always ask yes or no questions.
well, forget about that for now.
the circus is here tonight, and if there's ice on the floor, some of the fire-eaters may slip and fall and impale themselves on their sticks that are on fire in front of all the nice children.
do you understand?
you also told me to never run in the hallway.
forget about the conversation we had two years ago.
oh, no, no, no, no.
she wants to talk.
that's never good, bro.
just melt the ice, bobert.
benjamin!
get in here.
quick.
uh, crystal, before you get upset and start firing everybody, i'm on the ice thing.
have you seen a small white pill with some spanish written on it?
i may have misgauged your level of concern.
or did i already take the pill?
hello.
yeah, i think you've already taken the pill.
i just hate it when the circus is here.
are they happy?
are they sad?
why are their pockets so big?
i believe you are talking about clowns.
good morning, beautiful people.
good morning, alonzo.
you're in an impossibly wonderful mood again today.
every day is a beautiful day, my friend.
really, every day?
ben, that was the most beautiful day.
that was the day i stopped caring about myself and started my life of service to the great people of san diego.
what are you doing?
i gotta get this pill outta my system.
what's happening with my charity event today?
i invested rather heavily in an illegal himalayan dog track.
one of the dogs allegedly bit a himalayan.
anyway, i've got a himalayan nightmare on my hands.
can't we use that money to make this place nice again?
well, you are the owner, so we should do what you say.
see that oil painting of me?
make sure you have a good mix of kids for the photo-op.
you know, black, white.
get me an asian kid.
oh, and i'm gonna need some kind of a trophy.
have the asian child hand me some kind of a trophy.
you're right to clap, because these are all very strong ideas.
oh, benjamin, i almost forgot.
you... your son?
so how is your new assistant working out?
thank you for her, by the way.
she... she lit a man on fire?
there was an investigation.
the evidence was inconclusive.
uh, yes.
but the guy's okay, though, right?
well, s-she did light him on fire, so...
he's not great.
a-a-al-al...
alonzo...
"what do you think it means when a girl sends you a text that says ""we need to talk""?"
i'm going through something similar.
uh, i think it means you have an opportunity to get closer.
what's better than that?
yeah, that's what i think, too.
happy birthday, little man.
good morning, heather.
good morning.
and i'll tell you why i love it.
hey, ben!
there's a guy in your office, and he's gorgeous.
okay.
hi.
hi.
was somebody else in here with you, somebody maybe a little more attractive than you are?
no.
okay.
i'm ben.
i'm roman.
so you're crystal's son.
that must be terrible for you.
yeah.
it has not been fantastic.
i like how they float on the ocean.
okay.
and i like mafia movies.
uh, as for my skills...
well, this is a very exciting place.
we've got political conventions, sports, the rodeo, lingerie football, motocross.
does any of that interest you at all?
remember me?
i sent you three texts, and you didn't return any of them.
i'd think after five months of sleeping together, you'd know how much dangling texts drive me crazy.
look, i-i know we said we hate commitment.
"and i signed up for this ""friends with benefits"" thing."
but this morning, i woke up at your place, alone, which means you snuck out of your own apartment.
and i couldn't find my underwear until i pulled them out of my purse while paying for coffee.
and although i did get a free coffee, i need more...
who is this?
and mafia movies, i like those, too.
well, you and i really need to talk.
yes, we do, because it's an opportunity to get closer.
and what's better than that?
i mean, this is a good job opportunity for you.
i'll see you at the christmas party.
oh, you can't possibly mean that.
say it in spanish.
i speak a little spanish.
yeah, i don't understand what you just said.
well, actually, your english is pretty good.
elephant?
oh, crystal.
did you hear what i just said?
i did not.
let me see the speech.
"i don't think you should open with ""yay, black kids."""
well, when should i say it?
i don't think you should say it at all.
and i would also cut the song.
there's still ice out there.
yeah, i know.
well, it doesn't seem sad to me.
that's the way you set your life up.
you never wanted someone to be emotionally dependent on you, wondering how you are, where you are, kissing you good-bye in the morning, waiting for you to get home at night.
what better day to celebrate all that than on your birthday?
but on your birthday, you throw huge parties for yourself.
i need to know that i'm not gonna be alone.
i'm not sure what to do now.
i'll get out, and you can just drive away.
thanks.
♪ oh, the blacks and the whites and the asians and the... ♪
don't sing the song.
i think we should go to dinner tonight for my birthday.
i think that's a very good step for us.
and i think we should be together.
i'm ending this with you.
why did you let me go first?
you go first.
in all future conversations, you go first.
we were seeing other people, remember?
alonzo?
he's my best friend.
for a while now, he's wanted me to move in with him.
he wants more of a commitment.
he wants more of a commitment?
this is a man we're talking about, right?
oh, very much so.
look, ben...
alonzo is a grown-up.
he cares about other people.
he asks me questions about myself and actually listens to the answers.
well, what bothers me is, i thought we were the same.
when you said you were emotionally broken,
what did he say when you told him?
he was already a very happy man.
this must have made his head explode.
move in with me.
we can do the committed thing.
honey, i-i'm not the answer for you.
you're sweet, and you're really fun to be around.
but no one is the answer for you, because you only think about yourself.
what was that?
i think it was the inside of my head.
i can't be a fry cook.
looks like it.
you know what the worst part is?
i don't care about anyone other than myself.
i find it virtually impossible to care about any of that.
all of a sudden, i want to make a connection, and i don't have the first clue how to do it.
i'm in trouble, man.
kermit the frog, right?
yeah.
well, what about it?
uh, it's just a really good song.
come on, man.
sunshine.
hey, ben.
hey.
he is really appealing.
uh, hi.
do any of you guys know how to use an axe?
come on, clowns.
we're gettin' there.
gettin' there.
good afternoon.
where's the asian kid?
i specifically requested an asian kid.
there's an asian kid right there.
alonzo.
yes.
yes.
thank you.
they have stopped.
people often ask me why i love children so much.
maybe it's because i never had one of my own.
i believe that our children's happiness is the true marker of the kind of people we are and the society we want to live in.
their well-being is of the utmost importance as they are our future.
and when you ask them to get things for you, they do it with enthusiasm.
or maybe it's something i've come to believe as i've gotten older... that a life lived only for one's self is empty.
i wasn't going to, but i think i need to sing a little song i wrote for this occasion.
well, aside from the musical portion, that was unbelievably moving.
sometimes it's a real pleasure to work for you.
i'm crazy high right now.
"on three, everyone say, ""thank you, crystal cohen."""
two...
oh, my god!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
what an almost beautiful, beautiful moment.
i noticed you took off a little early.
hi.
a-are you okay?
i'm a little scared.
well, uh... yeah.
you know, you've gotta be wondering if you're picking the right guy.
oh, i'm 100% sure i'm picking the right guy.
oh, right.
well, what a wonderful, wonderful moment.
i've never done this before.
what if i'm not ready?
what if he just thinks he wants me?
what if after he gets me, he doesn't want me anymore?
of course he's gonna want you.
you're everything.
you're everything.
okay?
okay.
okay.
hey, you know, we could have sex one last time.
hello, crystal.
i'd very much like to make love to him.
i will see what i can do.
may i direct your attention to the terrified child you're hurling through the air?
in any case, this is what i've convinced them to go with now.
more than when you kicked the policeman.
less than when you sank the mayor's boat.
great.
great.
while i have you,
i'd like you to sit down with someone who's childlike enthusiasm and loyalty is gonna make him a terrific asset here at the sunshine center.
get in the cart.
get in the cart.
i'm sure you two have a lot to talk about.
wonderful.
happy birthday, ben.
thanks.
hey.
what's your name?
dan.
thanks, dan.
already forgot it.
have you seen alice?
she's up in her office.
just a work thing.
ben...
oh, i see what you mean.
what do you do in a situation like this?
you know what, i-i'm gonna run for my life.
yeah, i'll do that too.
they've installed security cameras pointed directly at paddy's.
melts in your mouth.
oh, she'll argue with everything you say.
you know, it's bullshit.
and these guys have finally realized, by living with me, that old dee is pretty cool after all, and pretty funny, too.
dee, you're on a need-to-know basis here, okay?
dee, the one time we bring you in on a thing instead of charlie and all we get is back-sass and questions?
maybe up in your secret private office up there?
i'm to remember every man i've seen fall into a plate of spaghetti?
and i'm gonna buy one for the strange man behind me who i've never met.
for the reasons i said.
because i feel like you had a really long session last time.
and-and i didn't get to because charlie interrupted us with his goddamn emergency lunch.
i really don't want to stumble across whatever it is that you're stumbling across.
well, as i told this gentleman only moments ago, we are out of fish today.
i'll have a plate of piping hot spaghetti instead.
extra sauce.
oh, i've always wanted to see that.
comedians, baseball players, even protestors.
god bless cream pies, and god bless america.
look, i'm an experienced businessman with a long history in asian countries.
imagine my cream pie taste and know-how combined with your underpaid labor force.
wh... my series of accidents shut the whole factory down for, like, a couple days.
actually, we're pretty dependent on that chinese factory.
she seems fine and i'm not worried about her.
no, it's just all porn.
all aboard the tucker train.
not quite as in shape as i look.
oh-hell-to-the-no.
these are just a few cherished memories that i've saved from my boys' childhood.
also known as crap-she-couldn't-unload- at-the-garage-sale.
these boxes represent a lifetime of awesomeness.
oh, if only they gave awards for making fake id's.
a picture i painted in kindergarten and a thanksgiving hand turkey?
i'm sorry, honey.
i can't quite put my finger on it, but something about this place feels different.
danny's not the only one who can put a jersey on and hit things with a stick.
they were in the storage room next to the christmas lights and what i thought was mrs. bart's lost chihuahua.
i just don't see the point of playing if you're not at least trying to win.
"well, you gave us free beer and ballots and said ""vote for me."""
which is fairly unfortunate for all the people in the back.
not really doing the sports thing anymore.
god, this just feels like a different life.
i need to go hit things with a stick for beer.
all right, brawlers, i'd like to propose a little pre-game toast.
may we always remember that winning isn't everything, but having a full keg is.
oh, hold up.
everyone, this is riley and my daughter emma.
so if you're keeping score that's wheeler, 1-0 in the unplanned-pregnancy game.
hey, tuck, you wanna try some pop-ups while i get them settled?
ben!
that's what i'm known for.
you're going out with my mom?
i was going to talk to you myself, but bonnie said she'd handle it.
and i handled it by not telling him.
you can't tell me you're actually okay with this.
well, your mom dating your coach should make for some interesting pillow talk.
if i recall, the last girl you took to happy hour got so happy we got a noise complaint.
it would take a lot more than a baby.
i'm going to go workout until even my brain is exhausted.
if she could eat through her nose, i'd say she's doing great.
she's a daddy's girl.
mom's gonna be here soon, can you run my equipment down to the field for me?
this weighed so much less when i weighed so much more.
you don't care about a shelf-full of trophies, do you?
sounds like i missed a great game.
one other minor thing you missed.
the guys voted riley team captain.
i might have gotten caught up in the moment.
i was feeding my baby and you took over my team.
one minute i was picking up a glove and the next thing i knew everyone was shouting...
"""you're amazing!"""
"'cause i heard you were ""amazing."""
maybe it'd be a good thing if you took over for a while.
because i really don't care one way or the other.
"""in your face, suckers."" oh, i'm so excited!"
we just went out for some italian food.
this is exactly what i was trying to avoid.
honey, i think i should keep this part of my life private.
okay, honey, i know that you don't want to hear this, but i'm a woman and i have needs.
without even opening my mouth.
"she said ""hook up."""
i'd hate for anyone to have to cancel their plans.
well, thank you, danny.
not yet, but it will be.
oh, honey, are you okay?
i got here as soon as i could.
my hair, however, is 30 minutes away.
i didn't know who else to call to watch emma.
the dentist said he could see me right now.
and remember-- don't take home the giant toothbrush.
it's the bathroom key.
sorry about your date, hank.
i shouldn't even be talking to you now.
please tell me that emma is outside parking the car.
hank cancelled or something-- not real sure about the details.
but if mom asks, they had to put me under for a root canal.
oh, like you care about other people's happiness.
it's not showing up and hoping she doesn't notice.
dude, you're supposed to have her back.
why do you think she stopped being rigantor?
she got tired of all the small planes buzzing around her head?
hey, can i settle up?
it's on the house.
if it's not hank, it's going to be someone else.
hey, can i get a bar menu down here?
hey, mom, i'm back!
what are you doing here?
i'm pretty sure that's my robe.
hank, you ready to go in for round two?
oh, danny, nothing was going on here.
you are unbelievable!
oh, yeah, she hates those.
'cause we ain't watching the same game.
it's actually full of vodka.
so we drink it and then launch it.
there's a good chance we could clear the fence.
take a seat, wheeler, with the rest of the ladies.
what about riley?
all right, tuck, you're on deck.
strike out again and you'll be lickin' the lines off the field.
the last time i told riley something she didn't want to hear, she made me eat crayons.
i still tear up at the sight of burnt sienna.
don't worry, i've got your back, okay?
hey, teammates.
oh, don't you look cute today?
oh, is that my phone?
it's about the game.
oh, thank god.
i was worried i was going to have to bring it up.
i know it's your thing, but you've gotta rein in the crazy.
kinda trying to do that right now.
i just think you need to take the game a little more seriously.
you're putting me in a really tough spot with the other guys.
truth is i should've benched you.
but i can't.
you're the reason i'm playing again and i missed it so much.
thank you.
so what did you want to tell me?
just...
"""ding dong, riley's gone."
"ben's firing her right now."""
what is this?
the meaner version of what i was gonna say.
hey, coach, can we talk?
i suppose you want your robe back.
it's not how it...
my mom told me about what happened.
i'm really sorry for overreacting like that.
and i totally promise to be better next time.
i really don't think there's gonna be a next time.
hey, don't blame her because i'm a jerk.
so you don't like funny beautiful women who are totally out of your league?
no, that's my mom you're talking about.
and any guy would be lucky to go out with her.
i'll go out with her.
i would if you put the bat down.
ugh, what is the matter with me?
maybe you're just too smart and too beautiful.
winning is fun for you.
oh my god, i love it!
but what does that get me?
a room full of trophies and nobody to share them with?
danny seems to have it figured out.
well, neither of us are your brother.
yeah, i think i've probably heard that one or two hundred thousand times.
truth:
truth:
i was kind of looking forward to winning for a change.
never really tried it before.
well, i think you and the brawlers can figure out how to do it without me.
ben, nobody wants me.
go brawlers!
all thanks to my lovely co-captain.
riley even made up with the umpire.
turns out he really does need new glasses.
no, more like hide out.
honey, you have to help me.
the fear in his eyes is a bit of a turn off.
beat it.
don't worry.
i'm gonna find a guy that makes you happy.
okay.
he seems to be getting better.
hey, i know my boy's work when i see it.
like i always say, thank god for my ben.
do the wheeler, do the wheeler...
what is riley doing?
i believe it's called the wheeler.
we'll use you to monitor it from the inside.
what is patty's interest in this murder?
i'm advising mr. purcell not to answer any more questions.
you were found with your wife's body.
there's no sign of forced entry.
patty, i saw the guy who did it.
our firm was hired to do toxicity studies on a chemical compound.
these companies are worth billions of dollars.
michael, this is daniel purcell.
we have a containment problem.
she's head counsel of the world's third largest energy provider.
did you tell anyone about us?
acid rain from coal-burning power plants have pushed mercury levels to 87 times the national average.
residents tried to bring a class action.
they've had more than 200 lawsuits filed against them in the past three years?
why didn't he go through with the payoff?
i was wondering the same thing, but i don't see how patty could have known that we were setting tom up.
what have you guys found on purcell?
this is just to make sure that we're all okay cover-wise before we move forward.
my cover's fine.
ellen, i know it's frustrating, but we need you to back off.
we're all gonna leave it alone.
i thought it'd be valuable.
i don't have any experience with criminal law.
we must have chased him out before he had time to steal anything.
the first time, it was dark.
you know, late last night, i was struck by the thought, did someone target the wrong house?
isn't it your job to figure that out, detective?
if you see something in the photos that jogs your memory.
mr. purcell isn't here to be harassed, detective.
she always wore it.
this is a very important development, mr. purcell.
you find that ring, and you find my wife's killer.
mr. purcell, i believe you.
because the man who murdered christine is still out there, and you have been absolutely useless.
you can't use these against me.
don't answer that.
i swear to god, he's acting like he wants to get arrested.
one incident like this three years ago is not probable cause.
no, but... it looks like he's lying about everything.
i mean, two break-ins, nothing stolen.
the contaminant posed no health risk?
we've spoken on the phone a few times, but i think she's in denial.
she wants me to meet the guy she's dating.
if there's anything we need to know, patty will tell us... when she's ready.
whatever you've dragged your company into, it better not involve anything other than retrieving stolen documents.
if you're wondering what happened to mrs. purcell, take a look at the grieving widower.
my only job is to protect mr. kendrick, and if you've done anything to expose him or ultima national resources...
everything under control in new york?
daniel purcell for patty hewes.
do you have reason to believe that ultima national resources was involved in the murder of your wife?
it seems to me a lot of folks are losing livestock around here lately.
17 years ago, she used daniel purcell as an expert witness, and he helped her win a case.
why then did ibc global's report claim that 100 parts... per million was perfectly acceptable?
daniel purcell is a brilliant man, but when he faced patty, he collapsed.
no, for you, this is... just another big... conspiracy to uncover.
as soon as i give you information on ultima national, you'll toss me aside.
whatever he's telling you, you can't trust him.
i don't know who killed your wife, but you are gonna get blamed for it.
she and purcell worked together before ibc global.
roughly nine months after purcell's testimony concluded, michael was born.
there's only two of them.
we got the element of surprise.
we take 'em out with overwhelming' force.
on three.
uno, dos, tres.
shoot them!
detective stark?
excuse me.
y-yeah.
that guy right there.
and he is the one that you pulled over on the 12th?
am i under oath?
i would appreciate it if you would stop asking that question.
is mr. young the one that you pulled over on the 12th?
i didn't know if we had to do it again.
what?
you know what this is, you son of a bitch?
it wasn't really a bomb.
"""no blood, no foul"""
is hardly legal doctrine, detective.
even claiming to possess a bomb is a clear physical threat,
an egregious violation of due process.
i think your shirt is egregious.
your honor, we move for a dismissal.
look, liz, i don't know what to say here.
he is your partner, jack.
that's not good enough, jack.
we've been trying to take down wayne young for years.
l-liz, i --
jack, what are you gonna say?
i need to be alone.
you want a chip?
no, i don't want a chip, dan.
i think the -- the dust they put on it
makes you feel better.
you blew the case, dan --
but the state's case.
you mean your ex-girlfriend's case.
they're shutting down the investigation.
that means no more department resources.
department resources?
fight crime with pointed sticks and rocks?
you need resources to run an investigation.
tell you what.
good luck with that.
you watch.
y'all have a nice day, now.
see you in hell.
there he is.
thought you might be missing this.
damn right.
hey, you got any of that cigarette gum?
i ain't been thinkin' straight
since i gave up cancer sticks.
there we go.
all right, we got to run a couple errands.
first, i got to pick me up a shotgun.
y-you got this all wrong!
you're misunderstanding the situation!
please!
i got a deal goin' -- w-while you were in the joint.
it's a deal for both of us.
what kind of deal?
"it's a brick of ""h."""
it's straight out of south america.
i brought it in on one of our trucks.
i got a buyer lined up and everything.
and that's just the start.
if this works, we bring in more bricks.
wayne, we're so close on this!
you meet the guy, we make delivery.
what about the cops?
t-they can't come pick you up the day after you get out!
the cops aren't gonna be doing anything!
hard day?
yeah.
is it a girl, or is it work?
you're gonna need that second donut.
hey, dan.
what's up?
hell, yeah.
i'm gonna go talk with liz in the morning about it.
i got to call you back.
freeze!
okay!
okay.
freeze!
i'm froze!
why you got to hassle me?
you violate that sacred bond.
i got like three warrants out for my arrest.
calling back cops is not really on my to-do list.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
how would you feel if all those warrants went away?
"like, ""went away,"" like,"
"""julius, you don't have to go to prison"" went away?"
uh, because that sounds appealing to me.
i'm your man.
let's lay it on me.
i need to know about a guy named wayne young.
i know him.
i know wayne young.
what do you want?
i just want to get some paper and a pen and write down --
do it.
he got a place, uh, down on oakwood, okay?
and that's it right there.
that make us good?
we put him in jail...
we're good.
okay.
'cause i want to hug you right now.
you can hug me.
all right.
thank you so much, man.
okay.
okay.
what can i do for you, jack?
now, i was talking with dan, and, uh --
that means doing everything by the book --
not really your partner's strong suit.
matter of fact, i might just leave him at home on this one.
don't worry about it.
just fill me in on the case against wayne --
fine.
i will meet you at your office at 6:00.
wayne's working out of a garage in east dallas.
runs it through some kind of shell company.
but what do we bust him for?
figure it out when we get there.
no, dan.
"a ""preliminary investigation."""
yeah, that'll work.
by the way,
how did you find out where wayne was operating?
am -- am i still under oath?
this is the place.
hello?
that's weird.
what do you say we go in there and check out that truck?
well, how about this?
hit him with a city violation?
besides, they should know their security is terrible.
plus, nobody should be allowed back here without a hard hat.
you mean like us?
hey, it's a violation.
well, it's legal, doesn't cost more than $3.52,
so it works for me.
see, the law is like a woman --
she slaps you, doesn't do any good to get mad.
it just makes it worse.
what is this place?
what are they shipping here?
there's no way to tell, but --
i've got to call i.
it's just, um...
dan, what are you doing?
dan, we can't be in here.
what part of this looks illegal to you, dan?
all right?
this is a truck filled with boxes.
yeah.
boxes full of crime.
come on.
we're on the five-yard line.
i can feel it tinglin' in my loins!
that's another gem for the report.
listen, dan.
we are off to a great start here, okay?
did you hear somethin'?
start her up.
i'll get the back.
dan, this is an illegal search, all right?
now, if we get caught, we are in serious trouble!
your phone is ringing.
god!
i hate this.
hello.
hey, detective dan.
this is julius, man.
how is the, uh, parole deal coming?
hey, i can't talk right now.
i'm in the back of wayne young's truck.
it's a long story.
t-there's men with big guns, and --
i got to hand it to you, paco.
looks like it's working out real good.
aren't you glad you didn't blow my head off with that shotgun?
just a little misunderstanding between partners, right?
yeah.
let's go make some money.
yeah, i can't either.
damn!
what the hell?
thank you for coming.
i'm like inches from dying.
you look okay.
well, i'm not.
um, you know the parole deal that i made?
okay, the cop that i made the deal with is trapped in the back of one of wayne young's trucks.
there's no trucks in there!
i mean, you know, i got a girlfriend in jamaica.
maybe she moves back, we open up a bb someplace.
okay, yeah, and i'm here why?
you introduced me to wayne young.
y'all are friends, so...
t-t-that would be a strong word.
we're more like colleagues, dude.
h-he takes weed up north for me sometimes.
all right, look -- skeeter, baby,
you got to find this truck, and you got to find it now, man.
look, i'll give you $500.
that guy's violent, dude!
he -- he pulled a guy's thumbs off, man!
h-he had, like, no -- just, like, fingers left!
it was t-t-totally disgusting, dude!
i like this car.
comes with the stereo?
and the rims?
you can have the rims.
you can have the change in the ashtray, skeeter.
just find the truck for me, okay?
all right, i'll help find the truck.
i didn't mean to yell at you.
that's the genius of it.
t-they don't check your whole cargo.
what the hell was that?
ain't you jumpy.
dan, this is texas, all right?
you just described 10,000 square miles.
oh, god damn it!
then let's get these doors open so we can jump out.
what's wrong with that?
physics, dan.
it's suicide.
not if you push off hard enough from the truck.
it cancels out the speed of the truck.
come on.
why are you acting like this is such a bad thing?
we got wayne young right where we want him.
yeah.
on a two-lane highway in a flat, rural area.
exactly.
this is detective jack bailey.
please leave a message, and i'll get right back to you.
well, it has been 45 minutes.
congratulations.
you are officially on your way to becoming your partner.
still waiting on your boyfriend?
detective bailey's not my boyfriend.
oh, jack.
wherever you are, i hope you are having fun.
all i know is, it's down south somewhere.
how you doin'?
thanks a lot.
man, what took you so long?
dude, you asked me to find out about a criminal, all right?
can we just focus, please?
where is the truck with the cop in it?
you know, that way.
so i'm supposed to just drive that way?
what's going on that way?
i'm working on details.
oh, man, you --
all right, i-i-i guess they're doing a deal with some guy.
man, you're killing me.
you are absolutely killing me, man.
do you know anything else?
i hear that he's kind of scary looking...
and he's from another country.
we can do the deal on thursday.
no, i'm not english.
i'm from south africa.
yes, there are giraffes in south africa.
i will see you on thursday.
so, there's that.
coming with you wasn't part of the initial agreement.
hey.
do you want my car or not?
yeah, i want the car.
thought so.
thank you.
have a good night.
man, you got weird taste in friends, man.
dude got some weird boots, man.
i got him those boots!
yeah.
what else was i gonna do?
i mean, w-we're partners, right?
i mean, you would have done the same for me.
got any other deals in the works?
anything else i should know about?
oh, man.
dan, what are you doing?
good luck with that.
i'll finish it later.
what are you doing?
aside from trying not to get carsick?
well, so far.
i haven't opened all of them yet.
are you looking for a particular fragrance?
let me ask you something, dan.
like i said, these boxes are full of crime.
yeah, well...
you mind helping me out here?
get a little more light on the situation.
mystic sunrise.
it's natural.
i love it.
don't die on me, dan.
do not die on me, dan.
do not die on me, dan.
dude, will you shut up?
i'm trying to talk on the phone!
yeah.
sort of.
"the ""lil' trading' post curio shop,"" by lubbock."
i don't know, man.
it's like a souvenir shop or somethin'.
also, um...
oh, god.
i found out a little bit more about that south african guy.
perfect.
just focus on finding out where this deal is happening.
save the moustache.
save the moustache.
the scent of these candles is getting to me.
it smells like a mystic sunrise.
i think i'm gonna puke.
well, if you're gonna puke, i'm gonna light more candles.
no!
give me that.
this is 3 kilos, at least.
it's heroin.
it's heroin.
it's -- it's high-density.
it's, uh, small grains.
it's probably, uh, central asian.
wow, you sure do know a lot about that heroin...
thank you.
so, you're saying you planned this?
i'm saying that bein' a cop is a team sport.
it's you and me, jack.
just so we could bust him together.
are you serious?
"we called it ""catch, release, and catch again."""
bad guys are just a bunch of guys runnin' around with guns.
good guys are a team of guys runnin' around with guns.
thanks for the career advice.
hey, listen, dan...
what?
the truck is stopping.
why the hell we get here so damn early?
and why the hell did we pick a drop location way the hell out here?
this little town is between districts.
i mean, it's at least 100 miles to the nearest cop.
there's no way we can get caught.
nobody even knows we're here.
it's just in case.
hey, there.
don't worry about the guys with the guns.
mikkel likes to travel heavy, just in case.
oh, i ain't worried.
good to see you.
looks like we got a little business to conduct.
put the shotgun down.
get on your knees.
excuse me?
"i said, ""get on your knees."""
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa there, cowboy.
this ain't what we ta--
what the hell is going on?
sorry, wayne.
i had a side deal, you stupid son of a bitch!
win-win.
exactly.
what?
okay.
okay.
there is no confusion.
how was the meeting?
both are unreliable.
best we, uh, kill them and take their product.
weasel son of a bitch.
i should have killed you when i had the chance.
enough!
let's finish this now.
let's get the brick of heroin and get out of here.
open the truck.
you smell that?
come on!
come on!
remember -- stick to the plan.
there's only two of 'em.
we got the element of surprise.
we take 'em out with overwhelming' force.
go!
what the hell?
"you got a plan ""b""?"
let's go!
shoot them!
traitor weasel son of a bitch!
"i'm not liking plan ""b""!"
little early for you to visit us, isn't it, counselor?
i heard about the dan stark courtroom fiasco,
what is it?
it's about j-- it's about detective bailey.
he usually passes out somewhere warm.
i found an address on his desk last night,
hey!
we had a deal!
afternoon.
looks like you're having a little bit of trouble out there.
oh, it's not as bad as it looks.
i think we're all clear now.
"don't ever say ""all clear"" again!"
let's go!
who the hell are those two guys?
i don't know, and i don't care.
just kill them and get me that brick.
cover me in the front.
i got to call the lieutenant and call for backup.
lieutenant ruiz.
yes, lieutenant!
this is detective bailey!
you haven't checked in in the last six hours.
where the hell have you been?
it is a long story, all right?
detective stark and i need cover.
send 'em code 3 -- as many squads as you can!
"the ""lil' trading' post curio shop."""
it's about -- damn it -- 30 minutes outside of lubbock.
all right, now, we're under heavy fire!
that's six hours away, detective.
what the hell are you doing out there?
it is a long story, all right?
just send as many people as you can, all right?
we are so late, man.
we are so late.
the stupid deal was supposed to happen five minutes ago, man.
where is this place at?
it should be right up here.
man, come on.
i-i-is it right here?
yes.
it's back that way.
the road we just passed.
this is not a safe way to drive!
then you comment on my driving.
backup's 20 minutes away, at least.
that sounds about right.
we got to bring the bad guys to the backup.
we'll meet up with the cavalry en route.
that's a good idea, dan.
way ahead of you.
take a look!
you're gonna die, it might as well be in a hot rod!
you ready?
"i'm waiting for you to say ""go."""
let's go!
get in the car!
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
you don't know how to hot-wire a car?
what the hell they teach you at the academy?
go!
go, go, go, go!
son of a bitch!
you!
you make this thing go any faster?
got a small-block v-8 in this!
the transmission's shot!
i'm thinking maybe we should have took the sedan.
you want some?
dan, when did you get a chocolate bar?
i got it back at the shop when you were on the phone.
i-it's got almonds nougat...
son of a bitch!
i want that brick now!
i'm thinking this isn't a very good situation anymore!
what, you don't think i already know that?
get some!
come on.
come on!
hang on.
nice!
that's exactly what i would have done.
that's what scares me.
nobody's movin'.
i think we're all clear.
are you seeing what i'm seeing?
it seems to be a flaming truck of some sort.
i'll grab the horse!
i dropped it!
get down!
you all right?
yeah, i'm fine.
but i've been better.
yeah.
bastard!
gotcha!
oh, he's getting away with the heroin.
jack.
partner, we got a bigger problem right here.
put down your guns.
where is the heroin?
you're lying!
he's not lying.
we left it in the middle of the road.
"""packo"" ran off with it."
who are you?
why were you in the back of the truck?
we're police officers.
you're cops?
are you kidding me?
i'm not.
julius!
you made it!
i'll explain later.
can i hug you?
yes, you can hug me.
come on!
all right.
you better get out of here.
register your weapon!
what the hell was that?
we hugged.
i'm a hugger.
looked like a walnut stock, 12 gauge.
anyway, he runs off over there...
there's no sign of paco.
and the brick of heroin?
no sign of that, either.
looks like he got away with that, too.
he didn't leave any friends behind,
and wayne young has agreed to testify against him.
and i believe his exact words were,
"""i'm gonna drag that little weasel to hell with me."""
well, that's helpful.
yeah, but y-you know what's not so helpful?
it wasn't really part of the plan.
it just sort of evolved.
you came all the way out here 'cause you were worried about me?
no.
i drove all this way to see wayne young in handcuffs.
so i'm sorry for that, jack.
well, i stole a sports car and torched a semi.
can we call it even?
we've been, uh, questioning that south african guy.
you know they got giraffes down there?
it's like christmas in there.
dan, we lost a brick of pure heroin, all right?
we can hardly call it a victory.
"i wouldn't say ""lost."""
what are you talking about?
"don't ever say ""all clear"" again!"
cover me in the front.
i got to call the lieutenant and call for backup.
yes, lieutenant!
this is detective bailey.
it is a long story, all right?
send 'em code 3 -- as many squads as you can!
hey, old timer...
sorry about the shootout.
how much for this, uh, doorstop?
oh, that's five dollars.
it's a brick.
that's hand-painted, there.
i'll give you three.
done.
here you go.
that's three.
how much for one of them chocolate bars?
them candy bars is 50 cents.
why'd you do that?
i was hungry.
no, not the candy bar.
what made you think of switching up the bricks?
well, you wanted to do it by the book, right?
yeah.
that it is.
i'm not gonna waste your time.
i'm bringing you top product.
this is the best heroin that money can buy.
this is easily worth $400,000.
that's wholesale.
there.
"""remember the alamo""?"
well, listen.
wait.
wayne young busted in 48 hours,
all for $3.50.
actually, $3.52.
and all i have to do
like i said, bein' a cop's a team sport.
yet, for the most part it's a watery desert, empty of life.
hunters here spend their lives in a constant search for scarce and elusive prey.
weighing 200 tonnes and 30 metres long, these are the biggest animals ever to have lived.
despite their immense size blue whales are one of the most streamlined and energy-efficient of all swimmers.
they can travel over a hundred miles a day, for weeks at a time.
opening its gigantic mouth takes so much effort that they only do so when the swarms of krill are rich and concentrated.
out here feeding opportunities are always few and far between.
when it's all over the hunters must resume their endless search.
frigate birds, the pirates of the high seas.
frigates must be so lightweight that they can't afford the heavy oils that waterproof the plumage of other sea birds.
little fish try to hide amidst the undulating swell of the ocean, the only cover there is.
with an extra thrust from their tails, the flying fish get airborne once more.
with a good wind, they can glide for hundreds of metres.
not all open ocean hunters are able to travel in search of their food...
in fact, he can barely swim at all.
this sargassum fish must lie in wait for those seeking shelter amongst the weed.
in the featureless ocean, these mats are much sought after sanctuary for juvenile fish.
at last... his first opportunity for weeks.
he can only strike when he's within a few centimetres of his prey.
trusting his perfect camouflage, he hides in the weed.
the open ocean is so vast that some hunters can only find enough prey by searching as a team.
dolphins live in highly sophisticated social groups.
working together they can cover a huge area of ocean.
small groups sometimes come together, forming super-pods five thousand strong.
they use echolocation, a kind of sonar, to find their prey.
but these small fish spend most of their time down in the deep ocean, way beyond the reach of dolphins.
it's only when they come up to the surface to feed that they become prey.
once they've found a shoal the dolphins use their sonar in a different way.
as they feed, the dolphins work the underside of the shoal to stop their prey from escaping back into the safety of the deep.
down here, food is much scarcer than at the surface, so deep-sea predators must do all they can to save precious energy.
most simply drift, trailing tentacles loaded with lethal stings.
others, propelled by lines of beating hairs, glide gently through the darkness.
beroe, the top deep-sea jelly predator.
to grasp its gelatinous prey, beroe has special teeth-like spikes in its mouth.
this deep-sea squid fishes for prey using long sticky tentacles.
the open ocean may be a vast blue desert, but like all deserts it has oases.
the sea mounts deflect deep ocean currents upwards, forcing nutrient laden water to the surface.
success here depends on delicate maneuvering.
their strategy is to hide in plain sight, lulling their prey into a false sense of security.
the lion fish's stripes are visually confusing, making it difficult for their prey to judge how close it is.
using its extravagant fins to hide slow and deliberate tail movements, it edges ever closer.
the deep-water currents that sustain so many residents also attract visitors to these oases.
they journey hundreds of miles between sea mounts, using them as gathering places in the featureless ocean.
both these sharks constantly travel between the galápagos and other isolated sea mounts in the eastern pacific.
no one knows for sure why they gather in such numbers, but some certainly come to these oases in search of food.
if these little fish stay close to the coral the sharks won't be able to get at them.
as long as the silver sides stick close to the sea floor they should evade their predators.
there's never an easy meal in the open ocean.
here, it's these storm-tossed waters that bring nutrients to the surface, creating isolated patches of richness.
black browed albatross are the same size as frigate birds, but three times as heavy, and so they need a totally different flying technique.
albatross have the longest wingspan of any bird and that enables them to exploit the power of the southern ocean winds.
first, they glide into the wind, harnessing its energy to give them lift.
then they turn and descend downwind, picking up speed.
they often spend weeks at sea searching for prey without ever returning to land.
because the winds are so strong here albatrosses can afford the extra weight of waterproofing oils on their feathers.
they can duck dive to no more than a meter so they rely on the churning of the southern ocean to bring their prey up into range.
like all birds, albatross have to breed on land, but suitable islands are so few in the south atlantic that most are heavily overcrowded.
nearly half a million come back here each year to raise their young.
adults share parenting duties, returning every few days to feed their chick.
feeding done, it's time to head out to sea.
albatrosses are so heavy that they can only get airborne in places where the wind is strong enough.
from the air the ocean may appear featureless, but beneath the surface a network of powerful currents is constantly on the move.
it's these currents, more than any other force, that determine the distribution of life out here.
a whole community of ocean drifters hitches rides on these rivers in the sea.
they've gathered to feed on tiny floating plants and animals, a bloom of plankton fueled by the currents.
fine hairs on their legs slow their descent, and then with a few flicks of the tail they swim back up to continue feeding.
the currents that carry these wandering crabs also serve as highways for the ocean's larger predators.
beautifully streamlined, they can travel huge distances with minimum effort.
these hunters patrol the boundaries between ocean currents, where their prey often gathers.
each predator has an incredible sense of smell, able to detect faint trails left by their prey.
great shoals of fish are attracted to a plankton bloom.
a single school of sardines can be many miles long.
their defense relies on coordination.
when attacked, the sardines move as one.
each fish instantly matches the movements of its neighbour and the whole shoal moves in synchrony.
even when more sea lions arrive they can't seem to break down the sardines' coordinated defenses.
the shoal this big, the sea lions need to isolate a smaller more manageable group of fish.
but with so few predators the fish still have the advantage.
all the sea lions can do is keep the sardines at the surface and wait for others to join them.
tuna attack from below cutting off the sardines' escape route down to deeper water.
as the fish pack ever tighter their shoaling strategy now makes it easier for the hunters.
tonnes of sardines devoured in less than an hour.
the predators melt away into the blue, going their separate ways once more.
this blue whale is still searching for a meal to satisfy its giant hunger.
being so large it must catch an average of four tonnes of food a day.
trapped against the surface by fish a dense patch of krill.
this blue has finally found what it's been searching for, for so long.
a meal big enough to make opening its massive mouth worthwhile.
the krill swarm is hundreds of metres across and packed tight.
the whale lines up on its prey, targeting the densest part of the shoal.
it takes so much effort to swim with a fully extended throat that the whale virtually comes to a standstill.
the whale uses its tongue to force the water out of its mouth, trapping the krill on plates of hairy bristles that line its jaw.
but it takes time to sieve so much water.
blue whales may not be as agile as other hunters, but they don't need to be.
no other predator is better suited to exploit these scattered riches that the open ocean can provide.
the blue whale, the greatest hunter in all the world's oceans.
the open ocean created many challenges for the hunt team.
achieving this was to turn into a two-year mission.
the crew teamed up with john calambokidis, the world's foremost blue whale scientist.
john gets crucial information from these harmless tags.
well, part of this research and part of the reason that, uh, we're working with filmmakers is that it gives us a unique chance to get, uh, scientific information we wouldn't be able to otherwise.
so we are doing this under our research permit to get an insight into what they're doing underwater, how they're diving, how they're swimming, how they're feeding.
the team's success will depend on good water visibility.
too murky and the whale literally disappears into the gloom.
no shot.
the first year was blighted by poor visibility and the shoot ended in failure.
year two and the sea conditions are much better.
blue whales only surface for two to three minutes at a time before diving for up to 15 minutes.
and he's got to try and get the boat ahead of the whale, but not in front of it.
then, david has to swim out and hope the whale passes close enough to get a shot.
this year the water is exceptionally clear, but getting david in the right position still takes time.
after weeks of effort all the elements finally come together giving david the chance of a lifetime.
and he cruised on by, it took forever.
you know, they're so big it just went by like a freight train.
images of blue whales underwater are so rare that this shot, one simply swimming by is a major success.
this series is all about hunting, and so nice though it is to have that shot to make a sequence we've got to get shots of blue whales eating krill.
and what we've got to wait for is when the krill actually comes to the surface.
it might happen once, maybe twice a month.
the crew come across an encouraging sign from a rather unsavory source.
look at those birds in the water.
we're going to go take a look at it.
massive surface.
i still, i can't actually quite get my head around what i just saw.
david saw it climb down,
he hooks around, comes up and just grabs a big mouthful.
they're called blue whales for a reason, but you just see them underwater, this bright iridescent cobalt blue just pops out of the blue of the ocean.
so i'm up trying to just get another shot of the krill and sure enough, wide open he comes to one last time.
the whole thing probably lasted 10 minutes, but it was hands down, without a doubt, no questions, was the most intense, amazing thing that i've ever seen.
to share the water and to look eye to eye with a blue whale is something i will never ever forget.
and the full inversion.
okay, that's again a unique chance to see a perspective we don't get to see.
with this close collaboration the team have filmed blue whales as never before and at last have started to reveal the secret life of the ocean's greatest hunter.
you like him!
no, i don't.
practically every friend i've ever had has fallen for him.
it's pathetic, right?
when mia went on exchange, we wrote up a pros-and-cons list and it helped clarify our feelings.
so, ethan karamakov...
abigail - she emailed the pros-and-cons list to the whole school.
look, i'm coming to stay for a while.
no, i won't cause any trouble.
it wouldn't be forever.
yeah.
double battement frappé.
and petit battement.
everyone thinks a farm is a dangerous place.
relevé.
i know every rabbit hole, broken fence and rusty nail.
and nice long necks.
no matter where i am, i'm safe.
ribs in, tara.
and balance.
to the centre, everyone.
tara, you may join us.
but the academy is a whole other planet.
one minute you think you know your way around.
you realise you're in a minefield.
everywhere i look there's a new trap...
"""he smells like christmas."
"""the way he eats."
"""the way he talks about things, real things."""
can it get any worse?
well, since you ask...
at least i'm not the first negative on your list.
i suppose i should be thankful.
i'm truly sorry, kat.
i never meant to drag you into my mess.
trust me, i'm trying to find every possible reason not to feel this way.
here's a great reason.
my brother will break your heart, and when he does, i'm not going to be there to supply the tissues.
i promise i'm avoiding him.
so you think abigail sent it to third-years?
he read it.
just kill me now.
right, pop quiz.
who can tell me the real meaning of 'pas de deux'?
pas de deux.
it means 'dance of two'.
but what does it really mean beneath the french words, metaphorically?
pas de deux.
two bodies, one soul.
a guy and a girl dancing together to produce one pure emotion.
that's what today's class is all about.
i've never danced with a boy before.
it's true.
back home, girls danced with girls.
there were no guys.
first-year boys are just sweaty creatures that trample on your toes.
there are three important ingredients in a pas de deux.
trust.
pass it on.
unity.
great.
and, most important of all, communication.
without them, well...
ethan, isabelle, good of you to join us.
remember, to find unity, you need trust and communication.
are your hands always this clammy?
i'm allergic to you.
focus on who you're dancing with.
no-one else should matter.
do you want that in plaster?
relax.
you're doing fine.
"""what a great class?"
i just meant patrick's such a great teacher.
do you think it's a sign the universe is throwing us together?
la-la-la-la-la.
before you leave, i've arranged with miss raine for you to have the rest of the day off from classes.
don't get too excited.
instead, you'll be doing an exercise for me.
and remember, you'll be marked on this exercise exactly as you would any other assessment.
this totally blows!
one blindfolded, the other a seeing-eye dog.
you could be tied to abigail for 24 hours.
rather stab myself in the eye with a blunt spoon.
i did. 20 questions over 24 hours.
that's it?
"""ask anything you like of each other"
"""but you must answer truthfully."""
like i want to know anything about christian.
so you're not the only one.
sagittarian, favourite food - pizza, don't have a lucky number, and we're done.
well, i know everything about you.
it's kind of been broadcast around the whole school.
where are you going?
the beach.
i love this city.
man, check out that view.
i'm going to go and find christian.
we'll be down here, checking out the babes.
excellent.
oh, i'm going to love this exercise.
are you some sort of stalker?
so where'd you grow up?
one suburb down.
by the beach?
lucky.
you think i'm rich?
have you got brothers and sisters?
he's in broken hill.
i mean emotionally close.
well, he's flesh and blood.
this and that.
you have to answer.
says who?
the rules.
how far have you gone with a guy?
there's first base.
there's second base.
you even have bases your side of town?
ever even kissed a guy?
you haven't, have you?
maybe i could help you out.
maybe you could get lost.
hey, i've still got more questions.
and i'm trying to strengthen my core.
we could so be doing this at the beach right now.
i don't do beach.
do you have an aversion to fresh air?
i don't do sand, i don't do salt and i don't do sun.
great.
i need my water.
so do i.
we'd hate you to die of thirst, now, wouldn't we?
i don't care what his favourite colour is or what his family does.
so did he tell you anything?
it was him.
"""oh, let's go to the beach to do the exercise."
"""it'll be so fun!"""
i didn't know he'd be here.
honest.
what are you doing here?
perks of being a third-year.
you're not supposed to goof off.
you guys can play as well if you want.
i might be blindfolded, but i'm not blind.
come on, it's just a game of soccer.
whoo!
coming, tara?
think i'm going to stay.
i haven't finished the assignment with christian yet.
come on, we're out of here.
you know, at some point in this scenario, toilets will come into play.
you can hold on.
no, not for 24 hours.
i'm starving.
yeah, me too.
i'll go and get...
i'll get some food.
it's closed for fumigation.
find another one.
why do boys' toilets stink so much?
why do you have to be so nasty?
it's a fact.
they stink.
i just think that's cruel and unnecessary.
less thinking and more doing before we both die of asphyxiation.
while you're listening, so do you think maybe you could whistle or sing or something, please?
hurry up.
i still don't see what you got from spamming that list to everyone.
you're like an annoying little insect buzzing around.
it just made you look bad.
look, won't say another word.
there you go.
hey, where's tara?
haven't seen her.
huh.
whoa!
hey, babe.
there's plenty of room on my lap.
hey!
it's on, princess!
come on, we'll get them later.
do you have a death wish?
didn't you see what they were going to do to me?
you don't pick fights around here.
what are you still doing here, anyway?
well, if you must know, i'm waiting for the bus.
when have you ever seen me in a limo?
you know nothing about me.
way more than i want to know.
i've never met anybody so rude.
doesn't your mother teach you manners?
she's dead.
look, just call her if you're worried.
who says i'm worried?
i'm just checking messages.
what would you know, anyway?
i can see everything.
this whole communication thing must be working.
yeah?
can you see this?
ow.
i can't imagine what it'd be like to lose my mum.
no, you can't.
did she dance?
yeah, when she was young.
is that why you're at the academy?
you're going to quit?
i'm not into it.
i don't believe you.
i've seen you dance!
true.
he's in broken hill.
very good.
and let's say i got into some trouble.
i don't know, probably.
you said you guys were close.
so you'd expect him to answer, right?
brother helping brother?
not till i call him from a landline.
no call-id to recognise, so he didn't know it was me.
well, you know everything.
is this true or false?
i'd like to say it's false, but...
see, you know nothing.
me and my brother are tight-as.
i've got one question left.
question 20.
hit me.
why'd you tell everyone about me in the boys' change rooms?
you knew it was an accident.
now, why would i even bother?
i can't believe you'd still lie about it.
i know you did.
you know, i wasn't the only one there.
ever thought about that?
tara, what do you think?
does that say...?
does that say '2-4' or '24'?
well, it's got a two and a four in it.
you want to know why i'm so mean to tara?
because the three of you are a bunch of idiots.
i need to talk to you.
like you don't know.
you've been laughing at me this whole time, haven't you?
excuse me?
starting audition week... telling everybody about me in the boys' change rooms.
that was you, wasn't it?
come on, you have to admit it's a funny story.
and leaving me at the beach.
hilarious, right?
but you weren't even with us.
not responding to my pros-and-cons list?
i didn't realise it required a response.
of course it did.
because of you, the whole school is laughing at me.
how is that because of me?
look, if you want to know the truth, i was embarrassed by it.
i mean, i've spoken to you, what, three, four times?
and then you go and write all that stuff and send it to everyone?
i don't even know you.
tara?
tara?
she can't talk to you.
yes, she can.
you said you were sick of girls coming to you after ethan.
because i hate seeing my friends get hurt.
growing up, i had my mum and dad to give me the warning signs.
here we have to rely on each other...
prove to me yesterday's exercise wasn't a total waste of time.
nice work, class.
and admit that, like it or not, for the next three years we're tied together with an unbreakable cord.
so maybe we've got a bit of a way to go yet.
good morning.
good morning, bette.
hmm-mmm.
get dressed now.
i want to be there when they open.
okay.
i already put sugar in.
one is enough.
here's your napkin.
you want that buttered?
there you go.
good morning.
watch your step.
the inspector's here.
good morning, mrs. tremont.
good morning, mr. korman.
mr. tremont.
hello.
yes.
what can i do for you, mrs. tremont?
it says pork chops on sale.
all of these in this row right here, on sale as advertised.
what about these pork chops here?
those are not the ones on sale.
the ad just says pork chops, mr. korman.
it doesn't have their pictures or their id numbers.
what is it that you want, mrs. tremont?
i want these pork chops at those prices.
you got it.
jake.
huh?
jake.
uh...
sorry to drop this on you, john, first thing, but i have one personnel problem you should know about.
this kid we want to hire can't decide between us and goldman.
i know you hate this, but i think you have to step in and use your magic touch.
oh, is he really that good?
i can't stand this recruiting stuff.
all these kids out of business school think they're worth $100,000 after one week on the job.
i hate their attitudes.
all right, arrange it with kathy for sometime later this week.
i'm booked for the next few days.
well, the vale prospectus is shaping up well but management is resisting our suggestions that we provide data to help investors understand why the company is so profitable.
they're afraid of giving too much information to their competitors.
i don't know why we're dealing with this vale guy anyway.
he's a shady character.
i think we're risking the reputation of the firm.
if we turn him down, we'll never get his business again.
there's a huge fee involved and the banking division needs the business.
i'm worrying about my bonus this year.
oh, mark that down.
i think that's the earliest worrying about a bonus ever recorded.
yeah?
it's your sister, mr. tremont.
she says it's important.
she's has to talk to you now.
i'm in a meeting.
john, it's about mom.
she's had a heart attack.
she's okay, but it's pretty serious.
can you come out?
hey!
how was your flight?
all right.
the guy next to me wouldn't leave me alone.
once they hear you're on wall street, forget it.
"""what about this stock?"
yeah, i know.
ever heard of a stock called chrometex?
mario.
a guy in the math department told me about it.
they make those heat sensors for cryogenic capsules.
it's gonna be bigger than the telephone.
no, it's not.
it's not?
no.
good.
she's at home with your father.
we can go there first or the hospital.
whatever.
let's go to the hospital.
that's what i figured.
how's dad?
to be honest, johnny, he's a little shook up.
that's why annie's there.
she didn't want to leave him alone.
so what's going on with mom?
how serious is this?
she won't admit she's actually had a heart attack.
she's lying there going into cardiac arrest, she's claiming it's indigestion.
she's blaming me.
what do you mean?
she said it was the sausages i made for dinner.
she claims i was trying to kill her.
are you?
no jury would convict me, john.
i believe you.
i must really be sick if you're here.
see, mom, that's why you're the best.
not many people would have gone for guilt in your situation.
how you feeling?
are you in any pain?
i'm staying alive by willpower.
she'll tell you.
i've the willpower of a woman half my age.
you underestimate yourself.
did you see your father yet?
no, i came straight from the airport.
when you see him, don't say anything to him about the heart attack.
just tell him that something went wrong with my insides.
okay?
mom.
listen to me.
just tell him it's something with my insides.
he'll understand that because i had the hysterectomy.
okay.
if you have to go out, go to mcdonald's or wendy's.
someplace simple.
mom, i don't think you should worry about dad now.
i think you should be worrying about yourself.
you had a heart attack.
i'm not so sure i had a heart attack.
it felt more like gas pains to me.
mom, for gas pains they give you tums.
they don't hook you up to $20 million worth of machines.
did you see the doctor who was taking care of me?
because i don't think he was a real doctor.
he was wearing tight pants with a big silver belt buckle.
he can't be more than 30 years old.
they'll let anyone through medical school these days.
john!
god, it's good to see you.
you stopped and saw mom first, huh?
yeah.
how did she look to you, john, really?
like mom.
like she was gonna walk out of there dragging iv bottles with her.
well, it was only gas pains.
i'm sure she told you.
and the willpower?
a woman half her age.
so you're up to date.
where would you like your bags, sir?
uh, just put them right there.
thank you very much.
no luggage in the living room.
you know the rules.
i'll put them in your old bedroom.
the living room is still off limits?
you're kidding.
this place is going directly as is to the smithsonian.
dad's out back, huh?
yeah, in the greenhouse.
how's he doing?
mario said he took it pretty hard.
he's scared, john.
he's really, really frightened.
i'm not sure he even understands what happened.
what do you mean?
he's seen her, hasn't he?
i didn't want to push it.
i told him that she wasn't allowed to have visitors, and he seemed okay with that.
hello, dad.
hello, john.
nice to see you.
you look good.
good to see you, too.
i'm gonna be staying here a few days.
you heard what happened to mother?
how is she?
good.
good.
she said to say hello and tell you she was comin' home soon.
something went wrong with her insides, huh?
something like that.
the heat in your old room doesn't work, you know.
you may need an extra blanket.
okay.
the main thing for you while you're here will be to keep everything on an even keel.
mom has a schedule and their life is essentially one long routine.
and a sweet roll.
they start the day by clipping coupons, making out a shopping list.
that's very important.
i have a list of pills for you here.
when did he get so bad?
i saw him a year ago.
no, you didn't.
what're taking about?
i was here for christmas.
annie, i think i ought to know.
all right, i saw him two years ago.
a lot happens in two years.
why didn't you tell me?
we tried moving him to our place but he wasn't comfortable.
it's an hour away, and we're both working during the day.
at least here he has his garden and his greenhouse.
he knows the environment.
i can only stay a few days.
what do we do after that?
you can't stay longer?
i may have to go to boston.
it's just not possible.
we're just gonna have to bring someone in.
at least we have the time to find the right person.
dad just got old, john.
yeah.
well, dad, maybe we ought to hit the sack, huh?
johnny.
i can't find my pajamas.
i don't know where mother keeps them.
here you go.
why don't you put them on, dad?
i'll do it.
you okay?
i miss your mother.
well, she's getting what she needs.
a good rest.
she'll be home soon.
good night.
good night.
leave the hall light on.
i will.
sleep well.
i don't usually eat that much in the morning, johnny.
it was good, though.
thank you, dad.
you do much cooking at home, do you?
not too much.
since sara and i split up, mostly i eat out.
yes, she was a nice girl.
still is.
how's billy?
he's up in santa cruz.
freshman in college.
he came to visit one time.
well, then you've seen him more than i have.
oh, look at this, johnnie.
it's double coupon day at ralph's.
tuna at two cans for $1.38.
you can't beat that.
what do you pay for tuna in new york?
not two for $1.38, i'll bet.
no, i don't think so.
no way, jose.
listen, dad, i'd like to talk to you for a minute about mom.
there's something you should really try to understand.
mother is sick.
it's not cancer, is it?
no, no, it's not cancer.
that cancer is a killer, you know.
your uncle ben had five operations.
didn't do one damn thing for him.
i tell you, if you have cancer, you might as well pack your bags.
well, it isn't cancer.
it was a heart attack.
she'll be okay?
yeah, she's gonna be okay.
but she's never gonna be able to work as hard as she used to.
she has to learn to take it easy and you have to learn to help her.
i'm always telling her that she works too hard.
johnny, she works too hard.
you're gonna have to learn to do a lot of things around the house by yourself.
you see, mother's convinced herself nobody can take care of you except her.
we're gonna have to prove her wrong.
that's right, johnny.
i'm going to learn how to do all those things.
you'll see.
we'll fool her.
okay, dad, the first thing we have to do here is, let's see,
"""separate the colored articles of clothing from the whites. """
that's so the colors from the dark stuff don't get on the white stuff.
oh, that's right.
i think that's the way mother does it.
then we know we're on the right track here.
al right, let's start off with the coloreds, shall we?
oh, that's colored.
color.
white, colored, colored.
white.
colored.
colored.
what about this one?
that one?
that is white.
okay, it's colored.
dad, it's gotta be one of those.
maybe we should call mother.
i'm going to make an executive decision here.
all right.
what do you think we have?
"""uh, normal."
"i'm going to go with ""normal. """
what kind of water do we need?
"""cold-cold, cold-hot, warm-warm, warm-hot. """
what the hell, let's live dangerously.
hot-hot.
i think it's white.
it'll be ready thursday.
yeah.
what's the best way to get to the market from here, dad?
oh, i don't know these streets very well now, john.
mother drives us everywhere we go.
you don't drive at all anymore?
ever?
no, i can't.
my license expired a couple of years ago.
you didn't get go another one?
well, they wanted me to take a driving test because of my age.
oh, and you failed the test?
i didn't take it.
i was afraid i couldn't pass it.
what are you talking about?
you're a terrific driver.
johnny, a good driver knows when he's not a good driver anymore, that's all.
i couldn't remember what you liked, so i thought i'd put out an assortment.
great.
well...
these are good.
i think i'd like to see mother, johnny.
i'm not sure that's a good idea just yet, dad.
i mean, mom's okay, but they really like to, uh, limit the number of visitors.
i'm her husband.
i should see her.
it's not right.
pretty good.
he made me breakfast this morning.
no, i'm serious.
i don't know, a box of granola.
yeah.
that sounds right.
all right, bye-bye.
okay, dad.
annie's gonna talk to the people at the hospital.
and she thinks we'll be able to visit mom in a day or two.
oh, good.
yeah.
what?
i think i could do the dishes.
i made these cards all color-coded.
there's a different set of cards for each chore.
for example, now, these pink ones are for dishwashing.
go ahead, take a look and see what number one is.
number one:
"""fill sink with water. """
right.
number two?
"""put one squeeze of soap in water. """
right.
"""put dishes in soapy water. """
i made these for you to study on your own.
this is great, johnny.
there's no way i could make a mistake as long as i just follow these cards.
you know, you could market these.
i'm gonna have to show you how to work the stove here, dad.
no, on second thought, the stove is out of bounds for now.
no stove.
and stay away from that blender.
no blending.
i think i'll work better with this on.
your mother doesn't like me to wear this.
thinks i look too tough.
like johnny cash.
you don't mind if i wear it, do you?
no, dad, i don't mind.
don't take your guns to town, son
leave those guns at home
bang, bang.
"""fill the sink. """
that is a professionally waxed floor, dad.
you can see yourself in that floor.
no waxy yellow build-up.
you know what i think?
i think we owe ourselves a reward.
what do you mean?
we should go out and have a good time.
what do you say?
okay.
okay.
what do you and mom do around here for fun?
"""i"" 20."
"""i"" two-zero."
"""0"" 75."
seven-five.
"""b"" 11."
"""b"" one-one."
right there on top, okay?
"""g"" 58."
"""g"" five-eight."
you kidding me?
do they have air conditioning in here, dad?
or a fan or something?
"""i"" 22..."
choo-choo!
i love when they do that.
they do that all the time?
"""b"" 4."
and after!
boy, this really is too much fun for one evening.
"""i"" 19."
bingo!
bingo!
jake tremont, is that you?
hal mccarthy.
how are you?
you remember gloria?
my son, john.
he's visiting from new york.
how do you do?
bette here?
no, she's in the hospital.
that's the part that's good to know.
please give her our best.
we will.
thank you.
you heard about nick price, right?
he's dead.
oh, yeah.
nick, robin, dorothy, the twins.
all of them.
the whole table.
and delores patcher from the table next to them.
gone.
dead.
well, good seeing you again.
it's been a while.
a long time.
nice to meet you.
boy, they're a breath of fresh air.
know their bingo, though.
you used to come here a lot, huh, dad?
when was the last time you played?
must be three years.
you're kidding.
why did you stop coming?
i don't know.
your mother and i used to enjoy having fun as much as anybody, but...
we just stopped doing the things we liked.
i don't know why.
well, you should remember the fun things you used to do and you should start doing them.
that's a good idea.
john, i'm going to write that down.
i'll make a list of fun things and i'll do them.
yes, sir.
bingo.
what?
i think you got bingo.
hey, i got bingo!
i'm worried about you, john.
i'm afraid you're getting addicted.
we ought to check that out.
we should be able to win, and win regularly at this game.
i got a computer guy in new york i'm gonna put onto this.
fabulous with numbers.
he'll come up with a system for us.
you'll see.
we're gonna beat these guys, dad.
i'm sorry, i didn't mean to keep you out so late.
it feels like new year's eve.
all that's missing is guy lombardo.
he's dead.
surprised hal mccarthy didn't bring that up.
big day tomorrow.
better get some sleep.
good night, john.
good night, dad.
"""b"" 4."
and after.
there they are, dad.
hi, dad.
you gotta be kidding me.
you ready to see her, dad?
i can't believe how good dad looks.
you really think so?
you've been terrific for him, john.
he's been good for me, too.
it's been kind of fun.
i have a lead on somebody to take over at the house.
it should only be a day or two.
i can stay until mom gets home.
really?
yeah, no big deal.
hi, bette.
are you all right?
yeah.
you taking your blood-pressure pills?
are you eating?
yeah, i'm fine, bette.
i make my own bed now.
and i do the dishes.
john is teaching me to cook.
he's like a regular wife.
just keep him alive till i get home.
thank you for your confidence.
mom looks good, doesn't she?
yeah, wonderful.
i never go anywhere without my tubes.
i meant your color, mom.
my color?
what are you, a decorator?
and don't call me mom.
i don't call you son, do i?
stop trying to be so nice to my mother, mario.
you're gonna kill her.
why are you cooking?
there's food prepared in the freezer.
i told you.
it's just for a little variety, that's all.
last night we had salmon.
the night before that we had coq au vin.
your father doesn't like foreign food.
it's just chicken in red wine.
he's not allowed to have red wine.
mom, it was this much.
i don't want him becoming an alcoholic while i'm in here.
nobody ever became an alcoholic from coq au vin.
take it easy, bette.
don't get all excited.
you just concentrate on getting better and don't worry about me.
you sure you wanna come up, dad?
it could be a long meeting.
no, i'll come up.
i'll be okay.
i could buy you a lunch here, you could catch a movie.
i'll sit, i'll read a magazine.
i'll be fine.
all right.
john tremont to see vic walton, please.
he's expecting you.
dad, you sure you're gonna be okay out here with all this construction?
sure, as long as no one throws a drop cloth over me.
john, good to see you.
pardon our mess.
good to see you, too, vic.
this is my father, jake tremont.
dad, this is vic walton.
nice to meet you, mr. tremont.
and you.
we're gonna be here about an hour?
i'd say.
all right, well, make yourself comfortable here, dad.
wait a minute.
we don't have to leave your father out here.
mr. tremont, why don't you come in and sit with us?
i don't think that-
ralph, we've given you every benefit of the doubt and yet our projections still come up 20% less than yours.
how can you be so confident?
you've-you've never run a business like this before.
and if you're wrong, we'll be the laughingstock of the industry and you'll be off on another deal.
forget about running the cannery.
it loses money every day it's open but the property it's on is worth at least $50 million.
how can you be sure of the $50 million?
we think it's a stretch to bring it to $40 million.
i'd like to see some supporting data.
now can i get back to my case?
the real estate is $50 million and we should have no problem turning around their trucking operation.
they let the overhead get out of hand but we have a schedule that shows us cutting back 10% of the administrative staff in a few months.
aren't you better off just selling it?
and getting it off your books?
there's no need to, if we can make it work.
i don't think they ever focused on it.
i think we can turn it.
the last piece is food wholesaling, which has been a good sector thus far.
now our cash flow projections for the division may look aggressive but we're comfortable with them.
so, all in all, the banks shouldn't have any problem financing us.
well, that was fun.
johnny, what the hell was goin' on back there?
well, we were talking about buying a salmon cannery, dad.
i didn't know you knew about stuff like that.
actually, i don't.
the guy coming to us for money doesn't either.
we're just gonna buy the company and then close it down.
that's your job?
you buy companies, then close them down?
it's a little more complicated than that, dad.
take this cannery, for instance.
turns out to be a lousy business.
it's third-generation management, and they've let it run down terribly.
but they have a small subsidiary that's a real gem.
the cannery itself is sitting on prime waterfront land.
so we buy the company, close it down, then we sell off the subsidiary business, then we sell the land.
you ever thought of maybe running these companies?
there's no money in that, dad.
the world has changed, johnny.
you wouldn't believe how the world has changed.
when you were a boy, you used to go to work at lockheed with me, you remember?
i used to separate all the nuts and bolts.
32 cents a day and all the ham-and-cheese sandwiches i could eat.
you used to say when you grew up, you wanted to work there, like me.
now i guess you'd just buy it and close it down.
you ever hear from any of those old lockheed guys, dad?
rick malinson?
tommy williams?
they all moved out.
to the valley, palm springs...
there was no one even there to say good-bye to.
next morning, someone else doing my job like i'd never been there.
the world is divided into two groups:
workers and bosses.
i don't know, dad, i think-
it's okay, johnny.
there's nothing wrong with it.
i'm a worker, that's all.
but you, you're different.
you like to be in control.
you like that responsibility.
you're a boss.
and mom?
what do you think?
okay, dad.
"""if you hit a parked vehicle and cannot find the owner"
why are you doing this?
i've already passed the written test.
i know, but you can't be too careful.
one of these very situations may appear during the driving portion of the test.
i want you to be ready.
very good.
thank you.
we've come this far.
i don't want to see anything go wrong now.
they want us to pull ahead here.
go ahead.
ease up, ease up, not too fast.
all right, stop.
there he is now.
jake tremont?
actually, he's jake tremont.
i'm his son, john.
you probably don't need to know that, but now you do anyway.
you can't sit there during the test, sir.
oh, i'm sorry.
uh, you can't be in the car at all.
what are you talking about?
this is my father.
it's against the law.
i can't administer the test with you in the car.
either you get out now, or your father gets a failing grade.
you going to be okay?
i will be as soon as you go.
before opening the door on the traffic side of your parked car-
john.
i'm going.
look for bicycles and other vehicles.
yes!
when waiting to make a left turn, give the right of way to cars coming in the opposite direction.
until all dangerously close cars have passed.
yes!
well, look who's here.
yo, dad.
yo, billy.
well...
told me that grandma was sick.
so i hustled back.
i figured you might need some help, grandpa.
never mind helping your grandpa.
when was the last time you ate?
why are you americans so obsessed with food?
you know, when in rome...
what were you doing down in mexico?
semester break.
a bunch of kids went down there.
dad, you say that every time you see me.
and i stopped growing two years ago.
how's your mother?
she's fine.
in her third year of law, top of her class.
it's embarrassing when your mother has a higher grade point average than you do but we're working that out.
send her my best.
how about you?
you win some, you lose some.
knowing you, i'm sure you're winning more than you're losing.
when you finish with that, you can wash it down with a piece of cake.
he looks really good.
what's been going on?
well, we've been spending a lot of time together.
quality time, huh?
they say it's good for parents and kids.
maybe you and i should spend some more time together.
this place looks great, grandpa.
you've added a lot.
you look good.
i'm gonna name this one after you, bill.
butter, anyone?
you want some butter, honey?
i would like to make a toast.
uh-oh.
a lot's happened in the past two weeks.
we've overcome a lot of adversity, overcome a lot of pain.
pulled together as a team.
and now we're taking time to say thanks.
that's beautiful, mario.
it's my regular halftime speech.
actually, i just wanted to say how happy i am to see the family together.
my chicken's getting cold.
i'm finished.
very good.
i'd like to make a toast.
hmm.
well, hey, dad.
to my lovely bride.
your bride?
did you have a drink today, jake?
before you came home, mom, we had a couple of glasses of coq au vin.
to my lovely bride.
bette, you're back in the bosom of your family, where you belong.
it's good to be home.
hear, hear.
well said, dad.
it's good to have everybody here, too.
i can't remember the last time we had john and billy together.
billy looks good.
i like that earring.
think i should get one of those?
i have a pin that goes with that if you want.
oh, leave him alone, mom.
he looks fabulous.
i bet the girls are falling all over themselves.
don't worry about me.
this isn't at all embarrassing.
i hear the dorms are co-ed now.
is that true?
yeah our dorm's co-ed.
good thing they didn't have it when i was in school.
i never would've got any studying done.
some student you were.
mario was an excellent student, mom.
he was a physical education major.
he didn't read books, he ran laps.
yes, but good students like me read books and ran laps at the same time.
now john was a good student.
thank you, mommy.
from kindergarten on, every saturday we'd go to the library.
get out four books.
you'd read them, we'd go back, get out another four books.
you did more than that.
so how does it work?
are the girls on another floor?
somebody hose this man down.
i'm just happy.
let's try to make it easy for grandma and grandpa while you're here.
sure, you get so used to hearing it, you don't even realize it's on.
it was on, believe me.
my fillings are still rattling.
sorry.
so when do you have to be back at school?
i may not go back to school.
i'm thinking of going back down to mexico to live for a while.
what's the big attraction with mexico?
all the people in mexico are trying to come here.
did you know that?
a lot of kids from school are down there.
they've got a little community going.
it's, uh, it's fun.
okay, it's fun, but believe it or not, you may want a job someday, bill.
lying on the beach in mexico is not going to help prepare you for anything.
unless you want to be a mariachi singer, in which case it's a work-study program.
i could say i went to college.
i'll say i have a phd.
might as well do it right.
two phds.
one in chemistry, one in physics.
i have to go back to new york soon, and i'd like this settled.
what's your mother think?
she said i should use my best judgment.
i'm not sure how i feel about this.
we should talk about this a little bit.
i don't see why.
we haven't talked about it up until now, and i think i know what i want.
johnny, something's wrong.
would you come here and take a look?
that'll be all for now, mr. tremont.
you can get dressed if you like.
is he all right?
yes, he's fine.
it's a very painful procedure.
no getting around it.
any idea what the problem might be?
could be any of a number of things.
i suspect small growths in his bladder.
the question is, are they malignant?
will the tests you've just done tell you that?
not completely.
the fact they're bleeding is not a good sign.
so this is serious?
i think we should schedule him for exploratory surgery.
if it were serious, dad, they wouldn't have let you out of there.
they would've cut you right open and operated on the spot.
i wouldn't be surprised at all if it were just a cyst.
i don't even think it's worth telling mom about.
why worry her for nothing?
whatever you say, johnny.
you're the boss.
he told you, didn't he?
of course, he told me.
well, then you know it's nothing serious.
if it wasn't serious, you'd have told me about it yourself.
look, mom, you're supposed to avoid any stress right now.
i was afraid you might get upset about nothing.
that's why i didn't tell you.
he says it's just a cyst.
that's right.
that's a fairly simple procedure.
yes, it is.
mother, i'd tell you if there was anything wrong.
i would.
okay.
do i walk around like this, john, with the back open and all the nurses here?
yeah.
it says right here on the admission slip,
"""dress is informal. """
there you go.
you need to sign this, dad.
what is it?
i don't have a catcher's mitt.
bad joke.
dr. santana ordered this medication.
it's just something to relax you.
if you have any left over, i'd like a little.
guess you have to pay extra to get one with a personality.
what time is it?
about noon.
not much longer.
nope.
is this comfortable for you, dad?
fine.
i'm gonna let you rest now.
that stuff's gonna really mellow you out.
okay.
don't forget, if you need anything, just ring the buzzer here.
i guess this is it, huh?
you're gonna be okay.
you know, john, i see men now, they hug.
we've never hugged.
wanna give it a try?
i do.
i love you, johnny.
i love you, too, dad.
well, mr. tremont, i'm afraid it's cancer.
cancer.
there were several malignant tumors.
not with a man with your father's age.
maybe this is a silly question, but are you absolutely sure?
yes.
it's a good thing we went in and got it when we did.
listen, dr. santana.
whatever you do, don't mention cancer to my father.
he's terribly anxious and frightened about that word.
it's beyond anything rational.
calm down, mr. tremont.
you'd be surprised what these older people can take.
their children tend to underestimate them.
i don't underestimate him, doctor.
i want to be the one to tell him, that's all.
it's cancer, isn't it?
mom, i told you.
it's a cyst and they took it out.
i want to go see him.
mom!
mom, you can't go see him right now.
will you listen to me?
you can't expose yourself to that kind of stress.
if he was all right, you'd let me see him.
oh, come on, mom.
john's only thinking about what's best for you.
you know that.
you got to listen to him, mom.
this is my husband and i'm gonna see him.
now, either you're gonna drive me or i'm gonna walk, but i'm goin'.
what's out there?
billy, go get dr. santana right now.
just do it!
get her out of here.
what's the matter with him?
jake, it's me!
why doesn't he know me?
jake!
mr. tremont, i'm dr. santana.
do you know who i am?
i'm fine.
i'm just fine, thank you.
give him 25 mg librium im and check his vitals every two hours.
yes, doctor.
this is fairly standard with older people.
they often go into delayed shock even after minor surgery.
this is standard?
do you have any idea what happened in there?
i'm sure it was a frightening experience for you, but what you got to understand is that what we're dealing with here actually is a form of senility.
he wasn't senile when he came in.
why should he suddenly go into senility?
senility is a very strange thing.
it comes and goes.
you get a stress situation like this and it just crops up.
i'm sure, with proper rest and medication, the situation will correct itself.
what do we do in the meantime?
nothing.
"what do you mean ""nothing""?"
we wait for him to respond to the medication.
did you tell my father he has cancer?
he had a right to know.
i'm not quite sure what it is you want me to do, mr. tremont.
dr. ethridge,
i don't have a lot of confidence in santana.
and you're the hospital administrator, and i just want you to know that this doesn't feel right.
dr. santana is a fine young surgeon.
it seems to me that he's been very thorough and professional in your father's case.
i told him not to say anything about cancer to my father because he's very frightened by that word.
he went ahead and told him anyway.
well, it's always a difficult call for a doctor.
he has to balance the will of the family members with the patient's right to know.
i'm sure he had no choice.
he had a choice.
he could have listened to me.
i know my father.
why did you strap his arms down?
to keep him from hurting himself.
he's been flailing around pretty good with those hands.
yeah, well, i'm his son and i say he doesn't need these things.
give us a call when you're ready, and we'll put him back in bed.
i don't believe it.
hey, dad, how you doin'?
does he always look like this?
look, hey, look, look, i've brought annie.
and i got billy here.
hey, dad.
how are you feelin', dad?
can you hear me?
hey, grandpa, it's me, billy.
how you doin'?
god, john, i can't stand to see him looking like this.
that would be absolutely adequate, i think.
i gave him a sedative.
that should calm him down.
how long had he been like that?
the whole time we've been here.
did he seem depressed?
jesus, doctor.
it's a good thing you're not a detective.
yeah, he seemed depressed.
what the hell do you think is going on here?
i meant more than usual, mr. tremont.
mr. tremont-
you're not gonna tell me that this is normal behavior.
this particular manifestation of the depression is unusual, true, but the sedative will bring him around.
a sedative?
the man is hallucinating.
he's crying nonstop.
he doesn't recognize anyone in his family, and you're giving him a sedative?
and why didn't you give him some sucrets, too?
maybe he has a sore throat you can fix!
we've scheduled your father for release tomorrow.
you can pick him up anytime after 12:00.
"what do you mean, ""release""?"
are you trying to tell me that my father has recovered?
well, no, of course not, but medically speaking there's nothing more we can do for him.
we cannot hold hospital beds for patients who cannot profit from medical care.
how would we know?
he's never gotten any medical care!
what exactly does that mean?
i'll tell you what that means.
that means they don't give a shit if he lives or dies.
what kind of word is that to describe a person?
i don't think-
just calm down.
you want my father out of here?
well, let me tell you something.
i want him out of here more than you do.
you're not good enough to take care of him.
john, what are you doing?
mr. tremont- don't you touch him.
this is very unnecessary.
i said i'm taking him home.
mr. tremont, this is very unfortunate.
what do we do now?
i don't know.
we may have no choice but to-
no, i don't want to do that.
i don't wanna put him in a nursing home.
i don't either, john, but we have to do something.
wait a second, john.
you can't handle him in this condition.
i think i can do it.
i can do better than the hospital did.
i can stay and help.
no.
why not?
i'll take care of him.
he's my father.
well, he's my grandfather.
and i'm your father.
i don't want you here right now, billy.
you don't have to see this.
dad, i am not a kid.
look, i want you gone.
go back to school, go back to mexico.
you're in the way here.
don't you understand?
yeah, i understand.
i want to talk to him.
it's not a good idea now, mom, really.
annie's right, mom.
come on, get in the hearse.
you'd like that, wouldn't you, mario?
"i meant ""get in the car,"" mom."
it was a slip of the tongue.
he'll be all right.
john's gonna take care of him.
here we go, dad.
this kid gooden is fabulous, isn't he?
he kind of reminds me of bob gibson.
you know, a real competitor.
did you get that, dad?
all right.
here we go.
a club soda.
well, we've got to work on your technique here.
that's all right.
a little home-cooked meal, that's what you need.
well, i think you're right.
wait till you taste this.
come on, dad.
all right.
hmm, all right.
here.
try this.
come on, dad, take a bite.
come on, there you go.
let's push our luck.
dad, don't bite the glassware.
house rules.
you just didn't like that place, did you?
neither did i.
we're going to be okay, huh.
here you go, pop.
that's better.
all right, dad.
hang on a second here and i'll have you all settled in.
let me grab these and i'll be right back.
why are we here, ed?
why aren't we at the farm?
what?
you know they'll be mad at us if we stay, you know that.
where's the owner of the house?
this is your house, dad.
what are you talking about?
mandy is out of the pasture again, ed.
i'm worried about her.
well, don't worry, dad.
i'm-i'm sure she's okay.
you think so?
i do.
hand me that 18 wrench there, by the chicken wire.
that ought to hold it now.
look.
a good night's sleep is what we need here, dad.
isn't that's what you always used to say when we had a problem?
"""let's sleep on it. """
well, we got ourselves a problem here, dad.
let's sleep on it.
dad?
dad?
dad?
dad, where are you?
dad?
dad?
dad?
dad?
what the hell are you doing?
oh, dad, here, let me help you.
come here, pop, come here.
no.
dad, i'm gonna lift the bed.
crawl out.
come on, dad, crawl out.
dad, come on.
i've got you.
shh.
come on.
shh.
i got you, i got you.
i got you.
mr. tremont?
i understand you put your father back in the hospital.
yeah.
i thought it might be difficult for you to care for him at home.
it's really not the place for him right now.
well, he can't be at home and he can't be here, right?
maybe he can just hover overhead in a helicopter.
it's very hard, i realize for children to understand that their parents have gotten old.
to know what that really means.
i know what that means, to be old.
mr. tremont, you have to understand that doctors are only human, too.
we can't solve every problem.
we can't save every patient.
we work in a system where old people tend to sometimes fall through the cracks.
what is it you want?
why are you here?
there's another doctor here at the hospital.
i think he might be better than dr. santana.
what?
i'll deny ever having said that.
he's a fine man.
i'd like to see if i can get him to take a look at your father.
mr. tremont?
mr. tremont?
how are you, mr. tremont?
let's get a few more studies.
please order an eeg and let's look for any metabolic abnormalities.
order calcium-magnesium and liver function tests.
i'm not sure exactly what caused it, but right now, i'm inclined to go along with the diagnosis of a seizure.
the question is, what caused it?
and why is he still comatose?
if you want to have another consultation on this, please do so.
no, that won't be necessary.
well, having said that don't get the impression that we're going to sit by and do nothing.
we won't.
we've just done a series of tests and we'll do more.
it's just that right now, we're really shooting in the dark.
we really appreciate your honesty, doctor.
those tests should have been done a long time ago, shouldn't they?
we'll keep him in icu, that way he'll be monitored at all times.
and i'll check in and see him twice a day.
i'm going to move in here with him, then, if it's okay.
i'm afraid, that's entirely against hospital regulations.
how long do you think you can keep this up?
i don't know.
i'm just goin' one day at a time.
i sit.
i talk to him.
i talk to people passing by.
i have this idea if i'm sitting there and i'm talking, he won't die.
what are you going to do when he does?
annie, i don't-
you're the only one who hasn't accepted it, john.
why can't you let him go?
i can't explain it.
maybe i want to be there to mark the end.
i don't know.
to prove he was here.
to prove i was his son.
what more could you possibly have done?
annie, that man got up every day of his life and went to a job he didn't like.
we didn't ask him to.
he just did it because he was the father and that was the deal he made.
he didn't ask himself if he was satisfied or happy.
he didn't even know he had the right.
somehow part of that deal was that we'd care for him and watch over him when he got older.
i screwed that up.
john.
i got embarrassed by him, by the way mom dominated him.
by the way he got old.
embarrassed that i had a marriage that failed, a job that didn't make sense, a son i'd barely recognize if i passed him on the street.
maybe this is more for me than for him,
but i'm gonna be there when he dies.
and i'm gonna kiss him, and i'm going to cover him,
and i'm gonna mark the moment.
i owe him that.
when did you get back in town?
i never left.
i'm staying with some friends.
i didn't want to leave grandpa.
you've been coming here every day?
whenever you leave, one of the nurses calls me.
i usually stay a half-an-hour or so.
where am i, johnny?
you're in a hospital, dad.
i think i could have guessed that one.
why are you here?
was there an earthquake or a car crash or something?
he speaks?
yes, he does.
it's something he learned as a child.
go, uh, go page dr. chad right away.
please, please.
why was she looking at me funny?
uh, she's-she's part of the hospital, dad.
she's, uh, a nurse.
this is molly, this is j.j., uh, this is annie.
this is my dad.
well, mr. tremont.
what can we do to make you comfortable?
well, to start with, you could take out these pipes and wires.
then maybe i could have something to eat.
i feel like you've been starving me here.
okay, but we'll have to start you off very slowly.
don't forget you really haven't eaten anything in quite a long time.
maybe that was what was wrong with me.
have you thought of that?
all the tests are positive, the vital signs stable.
this is the profile of a healthy man.
i've seen people recover from comas before.
very often we never find out why.
i have some theories in this case.
nothing that i'd want to see published.
like what?
somehow with that last variation of the iv mixture we got lucky and he replaced that enzyme.
i see.
you know, if we were back home, we'd say that it was not that at all.
but rather, it was your love and caring that called your father back from where he'd gone.
i think that i like that one better.
me, too.
here they are.
what's goin' on, dad?
what are you looking for?
your mother and i are starting a new life together, johnny.
we need some new clothes.
i don't know, dad.
what do you suppose mom will say about all this?
she'll probably laugh and call me crazy, but she'll laugh.
we haven't had enough laughter in our house for the past 10 years.
what do you think of that?
thank you.
thank you, thank you.
ladies, ladies, the show is about to begin.
no matter how stimulated you become during the performance, please remain in your seats at all times.
the house is proud to present the star of our show, the late sick man and almost corpus delicti, back from a successful tour of the caribbean,
gorgeous jake.
give him a big hand.
come on, give him a big hand.
here we go.
also his faithful companion, billy!
ladies and gentlemen, billy!
this is my outfit for bicycling in venice down on the beach.
and maybe roller skating.
this is my baseball-watching outfit.
see?
i think i'll wear it mostly only in the house.
actually, i'm going to go see a few of the games, but not in my outfit.
that's good to hear, jake.
wait.
there's more.
let me see that again.
oh, i'll piss my pants!
tell them to stop.
i'm dying!
i never heard of anybody dying from laughing, bette.
but wouldn't that be nice?
i tell you, johnny, he's not the same.
maybe his hormones got mixed up with someone else's.
you know what goes on in these hospitals.
nobody would believe he's a 78-year-old man who almost died a few weeks ago.
you've got to talk with somebody, i'm serious.
mom, he's just having fun.
it's a one-hole course, but still...
it's a wonderful day.
how about i take us for a drive after breakfast?
ah, it's a good idea.
maybe mom will come along with us.
i'm not going to drive with him.
he drove too fast before.
i hate to think what he'd be like now.
don't you worry your pretty little head, bette.
with old jake tremont behind that wheel, you're as safe as if you were in your own bed.
and it's almost as much fun.
what on earth are you looking for?
nothing.
i want to see if i can still do a pushup.
"i'll call these ""old man pushups. """
what about it, bette?
you want to hit the beach?
i'll go, but only in a taxicab.
i don't want to go in a cab.
we'd probably wind up in santa monica.
that town is an outside old people's home.
on every corner, a doctor's office or a bank.
i'd like to drive to venice.
oh, i used to like fishin'.
where's all my fishing gear?
i think i put it away in the garage.
about 35 years ago.
i'll get it.
it's going to be okay.
johnny, i'm scared.
he's talking about people i don't even know, or people i'm sure are dead.
he says we live on a farm in cape may, new jersey and he wants us all to go back there because it's harvest time.
what?
dad.
she told you, huh.
what's goin' on?
take me for a ride.
john, i need to talk.
johnny,
what chance is there that mother and i have four kids and we live on a farm in cape may, new jersey?
i don't think there's much chance, dad.
no chance that i have a little fa-farm there?
i don't have four kids there?
you and annie and hank and little lizbeth?
as far as i know, dad, you've been living here in la about 25 years.
held a regular job at lockheed till you retired.
before that, we lived in plainfield and you worked for lockheed there.
i know you must be right.
i mean, how can you be in two places at once?
i've got to tell you, my life there is as real to me as we are here,
just sitting and looking at the ocean.
stop me if this gets too technical or too fantastic.
your father is what laing would call a successful schizophrenic.
over the years, he hasn't been getting enough pleasure out of his daily life, so he's isolated his greatest joys into a dream.
he's created a personal experience more to his liking.
how long has this been going on?
hard to say yet.
at least 20 years, maybe more.
incredible.
you realize, it takes an extremely intelligent, strong-willed, and imaginative individual to do this successfully.
where is my mother in all this?
is she just shut out?
you're frozen in time.
she's very supportive, very sweet.
i take it that's not always the case here in this world?
she has her moments.
the problem is your father's participation in this world is totally tied up with your mother's approval.
since his recovery, he's been a happy person.
the walls dividing his two worlds have broken down.
and he's bringing into his everyday life the joy in living he's kept separate all these years.
if your mother doesn't go along with him here, he'll just fade away again.
hello, all you beautiful people.
maybe i can do some jogging on the bike path.
what will people think if they see you like this?
who cares?
we got to get over the feeling that we're old fogies.
and also stop worrying at what people think.
you sure as hell don't see any of the young people asking us what to wear.
i'll go with you, dad.
good boy, good boy.
don't worry about me.
i'll run over to newark, pick up some things for the farm.
hey, ma, ma, i told you what the doctor said.
it's very important that you support him right now.
making that kind of remark won't help anything.
the man is living in another time zone.
i think it should be pointed out to him.
that's all.
i've explained, this is just a dream.
a very well-defined and lovely dream world.
dad's learning how to separate the two right now.
he's trying.
i don't care what you say.
something has happened to him.
this man is not your father.
i think this is the real jake tremont.
he's just been hiding for 50 years.
hello.
i'm jake tremont, this is bette tremont.
we're your neighbors across the street.
of course.
can i help you with something?
well.
this is christopher.
what do you say there, young guy?
say hi to mr. and mrs. tremont, chris.
hi.
hi.
we're home all the time if you ever need anyone to baby-sit.
oh, how nice.
thank you.
no, no, no, that's a lying dog.
that one.
that's a good example of a lying dog.
yes.
yeah, he's-he is fast.
let's...
maybe if we put-
wanted to say hello.
brought you a little cake.
come on in.
probably out pole-vaulting.
did you hear any strange noises last night?
why, did you?
i thought i heard something.
must've been the wind.
close the door
they're comin' in the window
so how's it going with dad?
the doctor thinks he's making a lot of progress.
he keeps coming into my bed at night.
he won't leave me alone.
your father's always been a highly sexed man, but since he came back from new jersey, it's insane.
when we first got married and i told my friend fanny hogan the things we were doing, she told me to leave him and notify the police.
i told the priest in confession, he said he'd pray for me.
fat lot of good that did.
you know, when your father gets excited, police, priests, prayers, nothing is gonna stop him.
oh, grow up.
i'm a little teapot short and stout
here is my handle here is my spout
when i get all steamed up
hear me shout
"""tip me over and pour me out!"""
oh, bingo.
there.
you know, i just realized something.
we don't speak japanese.
you just realized that.
we should have one night a week where we try to learn about a new country.
we should eat food only from that country and speak that country's language.
we should do that.
no, we shouldn't.
"""where is the train station?"""
"""where is the train station?"""
what are you doing?
i'm trying to find the train station.
i think this is good.
this is working.
i'm beginning to feel very japanese.
oh, uh, yeah, annie, give us some facts, please.
costumes, right?
"""the japanese costume for women"
"""is hardly different from that of the men."
"""in many districts, the peasant women wear trousers"
"""and raincoats like their husbands."
"""this, coupled with the absence of beard in the men,"
"""often makes it difficult for a newcomer to distinguish between the sexes. """
i don't know about you guys, but i'm very nervous about a country where you can't distinguish between the sexes.
i'm serious.
that happened to me in a bar once.
john, john, you tell us about, uh, agriculture.
"""in this land of mountains, barely 12% of the entire surface can be cultivated. """
pass the rice, please.
only if you ask in japanese.
"""pass the rice, please. """
you're welcome.
come on, mom.
get in the spirit.
no.
no.
no.
billy, you-you go ahead.
traditional japanese sports.
what do you have for us?
"""the sumo wrestler must reach the weight of 300 pounds"
"""before he is allowed to don the traditional sumo diaper and compete. """
that's a great idea.
get them as fat as you can, then put a diaper on them.
john, you don't find those guys attractive?
mario, i'm starting to worry about you.
honey, would you pass me the...
w- w-wait a minute.
pass, pass...
what do you want?
what about the fish?
you want that, too?
here.
no, i can't take this, jake.
i don't want this.
i don't want to know japanese.
and i don't want to know the neighbors' children.
mom, would you just...
i've tried so hard to make it work, and you know that i have.
but since he came out of hospital, it's been like a loony bin around here.
costumes and jogging and sex at all hours.
and a make-believe farm in new jersey!
i'm telling you this man should not be let loose in the street.
dad is perfectly fine.
he's just trying to enjoy himself!
i didn't live my life to end up like this!
with a crazy person as a companion in my old age!
you know better than that.
the doctor said dad is not crazy!
as a matter of fact, he's very impressed he didn't go insane just hanging around you for 30 years!
oh, don't.
please don't.
don't say those things to your mother.
please.
we're family.
that's all that counts.
let's love each other and forget.
and please don't fight.
that kills me when i hear you talking that way.
why?
why are you doing this?
you're just gonna shove him back down again.
that can't be what you want.
i want my husband back.
he wants his life back.
he's loved you for 50 years.
can't you let him have what's left?
i'm scared, jake.
i don't know who you are anymore.
i don't recognize you.
i know.
you look at me or people look at me and they see this old man.
but inside, honest to god, bette, i feel 19.
and act it, too, i guess.
this other life, jake, it hurts.
was it so terrible here with me?
we just got off the track a little.
a lot.
you're asking me to turn my back on our whole life together?
oh, no.
i'm asking you to remember the life that we wanted to have.
you were so good.
not just to me, but to the world.
we used to have such good times, remember?
we used to dance together all slow.
you were such a wonderful dancer.
and i want to dance with you again before i die.
don't talk about dying.
dying is not a sin.
not living is.
good morning, mother.
good morning.
nice outfit.
your father likes it.
mr. tremont?
i have some news.
it's not good.
what is it?
well, of course it's not the same in all cases, but it seems, uh...
it's okay, good doctor, you can tell me the truth.
cancer's back.
it's spread.
it's in the lymph system.
how long?
it's difficult to say.
different patients respond differently.
dr. chad?
i don't know.
hey, dad, what are you doing up so late?
waiting for you.
why?
you realize your mother and i separated before you were old enough to stay out late?
i think i feel deprived of my divine right as a father to worry.
do you want me go out and come back in again?
no, i want you to sit down and talk to me.
what would you like to talk about?
i'm trying to think of something i can tell you.
some fatherly advice you can take back with you.
some insight.
i can't think of anything.
i think it's tough for guys my age to reach out.
you know, every time we see each other, it's always on the fly.
you're going or i'm coming, or we're at somebody's wedding.
we're always talking over suitcases and backpacks or holding little sandwiches in our hand.
i don't know a lot about you.
"well, um, let's see, i'm 5' 11"","
i like sports, i'm into bikes-
you know, we always do that.
we come close to-to saying something real and then one of us makes a joke.
talk to me.
tell me about mexico.
i like it there.
uh, the people are real and thoughtful.
um, the days have kind of a nice rhythm to 'em.
you have a lot of friends there?
yeah, there's about five of us.
you know, we live as a group.
we take turns working'.
we share everything we make.
we share the cleaning, the housework.
it's a real family.
the other guys from your school, too?
well, two of the guys are girls.
the world has changed, billy.
you can't believe the way the world has changed.
why was making money always more important to you than me or mom?
oh.
you said you wanted to talk.
all right.
because, uh, that's what i thought a man was.
some guy who wore a suit and made a lot of money.
all right, that's too easy.
because i liked the power of it.
i liked being the guy who got the job done, the guy who everybody comes to.
and something had to give and it was my family.
well, i would never do that.
i would never run away from my family.
leaving was the toughest thing i ever did.
it didn't seem like it.
well, that's because we tried to make it look normal.
that's what all the books said to do.
"the ""normal"" divorce."
but there was pain.
a lot.
there still is.
i've missed you, billy.
and you may not need me or even want me around.
but i'd like to stay in your life.
i'm your father.
i guess there is some advice i'd like to give you.
to give to a guy who's about to take on the world.
what is it?
be forgiving.
he slept a little.
you've been here all afternoon?
he does better when i'm here.
come on, let's go down and get something to eat.
the doctor will be here soon.
i don't want to miss him.
i'll come get you.
come on.
where's mother?
she went down with billy to get something to eat.
oh, good.
how you feelin'?
perfect.
yeah, i can tell.
you know what i've been thinking about?
what?
1947 world series.
what?
i'm trying, but all that keeps going through my mind is old ball games and old tv themes.
bonanza.
oh, this is great, dad.
what about the '47 world series?
how's that fit in?
it produced one of the great moments in baseball history.
they were between the yankee centerfielder joe dimaggio, the prince of players, the star of stars, and the dodger left-fielder,
al gionfriddo, a second-stringer.
he only played that day because the regular left-fielder,
carl furillo, got hurt.
do you know this story?
tell it to me.
well, in the sixth game, bottom of the sixth inning, it was 8-5, dodgers.
two on, two out.
up steps dimaggio.
hit a smash, deep left field, had home run written all over it.
everyone in the stands knew it.
but here comes this little gionfriddo guy.
he's racing after the ball.
and he doesn't realize it was hit by joe dimaggio.
at the last possible moment, he jumps.
it'll live forever.
but then comes the really amazing thing.
dimaggio was just approaching second base when he sees gionfriddo make this catch.
he got so upset, he kicked the dirt.
how do you like that?
this man who never showed any emotion, he was human after all.
and it took al gionfriddo to bring it out.
you know what that means to me?
what?
in america, anything is possible if you show up for work.
sometimes i wish i'd held you more when you were a kid.
i wish i kissed you more.
you did fine, dad, just fine.
do you know how much i love you?
yeah.
a lot has happened, johnny.
some good, some bad.
honey, i'm gonna put these in the car.
okay.
did you talk to mom?
mom will stay here for now.
at least till the middle of next month.
and then we'll see.
all right.
i think she'll be okay.
how you holding up?
i miss him.
yeah, me too.
go ahead, i'll catch up with you.
i need a minute.
go ahead.
um...
grandpa, we just wanted to take some time to say good-bye our way.
um, and this seemed like the right place to do it.
because there's so much of you in here.
so much that's alive and growing.
which is still how i think of you.
it's going to be funny.
yeah.
grandpa, i love you and i miss you already.
dad and i are here and we're together.
this is good.
this is a good idea.
i feel better.
me, too.
it is a mixture of tobacco and black hellebore and is rumored to induce visions and summon demons.
it just perched there, looking at me almost as if it were trying to reveal some kind of mystery.
the turk has arrived in florence.
but, this year, if i am to understand the politics afoot, the same shoddy pageantry just won't do.
as is customary with commissions, we shall pay half now and half upon completion.
so, tell me... ..is there nothing else you fear?
please... ..don't aid them in their endeavor.
but the fact is, i have designed a more ambitious series of devices that i know your percipient mind will take an interest in.
speaking of employment, a two-headed calf, stillborn on zitto's farm.
the last corpse was decomposing by the time i took a scalpel to it.
but a card can symbolize not just one's temperament, but one's fate.
this one... represents sacrifice.
i should promote myself as a military engineer, not a painter.
why are the officers of the night bothering that man?
cos your man's grip was too loose and now he finds himself staring down this handsome spada da filo.
cos if you'd just asked around, anyone will tell you that i'm ambidextrous and perfectly capable of fighting two or...
you've made a serious miscalculation tonight, artista.
but i am staying at the inn of the black swan.
come see me before i leave... ..maestro.
what did he give you?
the same arse, very different faces and, when i realized, i did a little sip on her tit.
i'll not have you tarnishing our family's name with your flippant tone and your vulgar attempts at self-promotion.
and much as i may wish to disavow you, our reputations are intertwined.
my wife, margherita... ..bore me a son this past week.
a legitimate heir.
i wonder how long it will take him to curse his lineage.
you... are a petty man.
by men who know how to hit.
that's what you've achieved, leonardo.
oh, they're executing a jew today.
she's appealing, i'll grant you that, but... ..i'd rather bed that old toothless hag over there.
please, give me something to drink from the fountain of memory.
well, that depends on what's in the pipe.
history is a lie that has been honed like a weapon by people who have suppressed the truth.
centuries from now, your own history will also be suppressed.
you have heard the phrase 'time is a river'?
what most fail to grasp is that the river is circular.
one man's death... opens a doorway to the birth of the next.
i saw a man executed today.
please, give me something to drink from the fountain of memory.
this temple was once a place of worship for a religion that originated long before christ.
we are known as the sons of mithras.
much of what you call 'progress' has simply been a matter of remembering what was once forgotten.
recently, certain clues have surfaced regarding the book's location.
avraham ben yosef was following those clues when he was apprehended and put to death.
perhaps you have heard of the secret archives the vatican has assembled?
its curator is a man called lupo mercuri.
i still don't understand what any of this has to do with me.
taken from constantinople against her will.
do you remember... an incident that occurred in your childhood?
i was a boy in vinci.
i'd been sent to fetch some sheep that had wandered off.
what do i do till then?
fate has chosen you, leonardo.
i don't believe in fate.
then believe in yourself.
well, where do i start my search, then?
with the hanged man, the seat of the soul.
he's already opened the door for you.
and my mother?
she will be for you on the other side.
all you have to do... is enter.
maestro!
we've been looking for you since last night.
this place has been empty for centuries, leo.
maestro, the officers of the night have been searching for you.
they say lorenzo medici himself has asked for you.
leonardo di ser piero...
i am told you are my notary's bastard son.
i'm also told that you are a troublemaker, you are arrogant, impolitic... ..and utterly incapable of keeping your opinions to yourself.
arrogance implies that i exaggerate my own worth.
my mistress, lucrezia, seems to think that you have a singular talent for portraiture.
she insisted that you and none other be the one to... capture her beauty.
i'd say she has a discerning eye, then.
call it a character flaw.
well, with this commission, you'd be wise to overcome it.
when it comes to miss donati, boredom is the last thing i fear.
i'll have your father draw up a contract then.
i have some designs that i think you might be interested in.
this will greatly increase your gunner's rate of firepower.
so, while the top rack's being fired, the rack below that one can be loaded and the rack below that one is allowed to cool.
the cannons are arranged in a fan, which -
propulsion is achieved by two men, who are housed within.
they operate cranks, which rotate the wheels.
cannons can be mounted around the perimeter of the cart.
it's a flying machine.
it's modeled after the articulated wings of a bat.
he would have been born with wings, yes.
i believe man will fly and i base this assumption on the fact that god has blessed us with minds that are capable of imagining it.
anything that can be dreamt of will eventually be built.
anyone who says otherwise is a fool.
what exactly do you propose?
i wish to be employed... as a military engineer.
i am a humanist, da vinci.
i have no interest in waging war.
nor does rome.
necessarily... you've both made alliances with states that do.
sforza's death has up-ended the game board.
you need weapons of your own, your magnificence.
i will give you a modest stipend.
to see whether these... contraptions of yours can actually be realized.
shall we say 100 florins?
if you haggle any further, i'll cut out your tongue.
as you say, sir.
thank you.
you used lucrezia to gain access to me, didn't you?
i utilize any device at my disposal, in order to realize my goals.
clever, but i'd caution you not to be too clever around me.
is there a problem?
none at all, sir.
ah, there are no secrets in florence.
how the devil did you do it?
oh, he played on a woman's vanity.
then get back to work.
we've got a colombina to build!
the jew that was hanged, i want you to unearth his body.
i need to examine it.
and my compensation?
well, that depends how fresh the corpse is.
ah, well, then, i'd best get digging.
ah, here's the pazzi clan.
with their schemer francesco and old man jacopo.
as is our right.
granted to our ancestor for his actions during the first crusade.
the colombina is about to fly.
welcome, all of you, into god's home.
the flames of the phoenix suit you well.
tell me, truly, are you always this wistful with the whores you bed?
oh, you are no whore, signora.
we need not continue this pretence any longer, miss donati.
i knew it was you from the moment you approached me.
how did you know?
i sketched you.
your features, your form, your bearing.
the more salient question... ..is why would a noblewoman risk her reputation on a lowly artisan?
well, isn't that the point of a carnival?
tell me, then.
you knew i'd seek you out, then.
lorenzo was quite taken with your designs.
well, may i see one of these marvels?
what is it?
it's a device for slowing one's rate of descent.
and under what circumstances would i possibly have use for this?
say that you were trapped in a fortress.
you could strap yourself into this... and you'd safely float down to freedom.
oh, thank goodness.
it would appear lorenzo's interest in you was justified.
you've risked more.
perhaps even death.
and to what do you ascribe my reckless behavior, then?
add in the fact that i am forbidden fruit... ..and your fate was sealed.
you're the third person this week to lecture me on fate.
well, perhaps it's time you started listening.
now...
fuck me again, leonardo.
this time, remember... ..you're not the only one capable of manipulation.
for obvious reasons, we can't have you parading through the front door.
how rude of me.
i promised you your payment first.
i take it you're satisfied?
get on with it, then.
a new player has entered the stage.
an artist known as leonardo da vinci.
the medicis have employed him to design siege weapons.
artists are as common as court jesters.
i see no reason why this news should concern us.
this artist is different.
my agent in florence.
if i am not mistaken, you are lupo mercuri,
curator of the secret archives.
it would appear the turk has found a new champion.
continue watching him.
see if he can be co-opted.
and if he can't?
then da vinci will be consumed in the fiery sorrows of hell.
along with the rest of god's enemies.
don't stiffen up.
yeah, you either.
good defense is about moving the line of attack.
when the bad guy comes at you, step off the line like this, creating a new one.
until he dies of old age, or until you swoop in to save me?
i didn't ask you to train me so i could stave.
i need to learn to fight.
you don't think that i would.
menfolk not always around to protect the womenfolk, you know?
besides, what if you were the guy i had to fight?
it could happen.
okay.
force the other guy to counter, and he'll open himself up.
handling a lethal weapon is a little different than shaking a pompon.
ready!
okay!
go team.
lilah.
i was just keeping billy company.
thanks, gavin.
i'll take it from here.
he was feeling cooped up.
why don't you go close an escrow.
you don't wanna end up in that awful place again, do you?
no one wants that.
congressman.
i trust you've stayed out of trouble.
let's go home.
this is the second time you've returned our nephew safely to us.
our pleasure.
"""our pleasure,"" in the sense that he had nothing to do with it."
nice boy.
oh, by the way, get out.
why don't you try listening instead of flapping that fat mouth of yours?
you weren't captain of the debate team, were you?
at least lindsey knew--
training with angel, taking responsibility.
i'm proud of you.
never hurts to be prepared.
if you think she can help you fight, why not?
i'm kidding.
wesley, if you want to get to know fred better  maybe the next time you have her over for dinner you won't ask the rest of us to come along.
i mean....
was i that obvious?
i don't think anybody else noticed.
still, the last thing any of us should be doing is coupling with each other.
office romances, even under normal circumstances--
we don't live in normal circumstances.
what are the odds of any of us finding someone who can deal with the stuff that we have to deal with?
i don't know, maybe we are meant--
for each other?
actually, i was gonna say, to be alone.
wesley, if you like her, tell her.
this murder happened a week ago.
why would they show this to me now?
how did you get this stuff?
the police sold you this stuff?
usually they sell to the tabloids when the victims are high-profile.
he says she wouldn't listen to him.
he was trying to make her stop talking.
well, it worked.
1 1 :24, 20 minutes before the crime occurred, look who's there.
what?
okay, kind of cute.
so who is he?
you're sure this is him?
you pull someone from a hell dimension, you tend to remember their face.
yeah, that's him.
now we know why the powers made me experience that woman's death.
she died because of me.
angel, if he's somehow responsible, then so am i.
angel....
hey.
whatever's happening now, you're not responsible for this and neither am i.
but i know who is.
you're a little jumpy, lilah.
long day at the office.
it's been brought to my attention.
i plan to.
i know, he has some power that makes--
billy never touched me, and you can't touch him.
that family's the closest thing this country has to royalty.
they own half the eastern seaboard.
the law won't go near them.
this isn't some beast you can just--
stay away from my client.
i don't suppose it'd do much good to ring the bell either.
how about we sneak in dressed as security guards or something?
so you wanna go next?
i guess we wait here.
why doesn't it surprise me that i can walk in without an invitation?
as far as i'm concerned, you have a standing invitation.
i've never hurt a woman in my life.
i just like to watch.
you're going back.
really?
you're looking for me.
we're taking you in for questioning.
sanchez, read him his rights.
who are you?
he's nobody.
i'll tell you what my problem is, i got a woman here that don't listen.
out of his $1 2 million compound and into a cell at men's central.
yes, but for how long?
an impenetrable cube of hellfire in a demon dimension couldn't do much, so my guess, regular bars, not really a problem.
what're you doing?
you can't barge into a police precinct and go all terminator.
there's been an accident.
maybe she can tell us what billy did to her partner before he snapped.
wouldn't be a bad idea if one of us was standing by at the hospital.
the blood in that car, some of it is his.
not human.
he came through here.
i'll take a sample and see what sort of creature billy is.
i'm gonna go run an errand.
a normal, everyday errand.
cordelia.
i don't think you should do this.
how can i not?
i managed to lift a sample of billy's blood.
maybe we can identify his demon lineage and figure out how his power works.
would you hand me the glass slides?
thank you.
are you gonna invite me in?
please, come on in.
i want you to tell me about billy.
everything you didn't tell angel.
what makes you think i'm gonna do that?
well, there's your face, for starters.
there's not a thing about badly reapplied mascara i don't know.
i don't switch sides whenever it gets tough.
angel feels responsible for this guy because he brought him back from hell.
i feel responsible because he did it to save me.
you, who are actually responsible for the entire thing feel nothing at all, because you are a vicious bitch.
he's widened the heel.
pink is out this spring.
billy blim makes people crazy.
then why didn't he do it to angel?
others can take hours.
gee, i sure hope angel isn't starting to feel testy.
you really haven't.
i have to find billy.
and i'm gonna help you, why?
you know that guy you hired to hack into my visions?
what he did to me, you know what it felt like?
i was cut, torn up, my face disfigured and burning with pain  not knowing if it would end or just get worse till i died.
it's the helplessness.
the certainty that there is nothing you can do to stop it.
that your life can be thrown away in an instant by someone else.
"and no woman strong enough to wear the mantle of ""vicious bitch"" would ever put up with it."
where is billy going?
hacking 1 4 years, i understand why he did it.
there's a point, right?
how many times you feel like taking a fist to a customer?
that surprise you?
probably sitting in the back telling him how to drive.
you know the type.
probably had it coming to her.
i' m just saying....
dylan, your cousin's here.
hi, dylan.
billy.
i didn't know you were having a party.
we agreed that you weren't gonna come here anymore after that last thing.
do you want to, or should i?
looks to me as if some of the red blood cells are supercharged.
those would probably be from billy's demon lineage.
so however billy's putting the mojo on people, the power's in his blood.
which means it could also be in his sweat, his saliva or even his touch.
speaking of saliva, where is cordelia?
"when you say you ""think she went out"" you mean you know she went out because you spoke to her."
well, i suppose that--
lie to me again and we're going to have a problem.
sit down, fred.
there's something we need to discuss.
i'm sorry i didn't tell you cordelia left.
however, we will have to make some changes around here.
change can be good, i guess.
no more of these provocative outfits.
provocative?
maybe mommy and daddy never explained to you that men, grown men are wired a certain way.
you can't come in here, day after day, waving it in my face like this.
you're practically daring me to take it.
is that what you want?
stop it.
oh, are we standing now?
you brush up close, bat your eyes and when our backs are turned, you laugh at us.
you think you can do anything you please because you bleed?
no.
i'll show you blood.
what do you tell a woman who has two black eyes?
nothing you haven't already told her twice.
no sense of humor.
t o be honest, i' m looking to kill the bastard.
come on in.
you gotta know the rules around billy.
everybody in the family does.
never leave him alone with your girl and don't let him touch you.
he wants money, leave it on a table.
can you explain something to me?
how come you invited me in after i told you i wanted to kill your cousin?
you' re angel, right?
billy mention me?
she said a melodramatic guy named angel would eventually show up.
melodrama is exaggerated--
fred.
i know what you' re doing.
what you' re up to.
luring me.
forcing me to find you.
it's such a dog-and-pony show.
you beguile me with your girlish ways.
but you never give over, do you?
no, you just keep laughing and running.
well, guess what, my love, i'm not some downy-faced schoolboy.
i'm a man.
you can't come out into the open, can you?
no, you hide.
you deceive.
you and the serpent, plotting behind our backs.
"""here, honey, eat this."
"it's just an apple. """
that's the problem with your sex.
why do you make me do this?
do i know you?
i thought we should meet.
i' m the woman wolfram and hart tortured to get you out of your cell.
oh, i see.
poor, helpless, battered woman  needs to vent her feelings about the injustice of it all.
no, ass-wipe.
i' m here to send you back.
sure, you're all whores, who sell yourselves for money or prestige but men are just as bad.
maybe even worse.
they're willing to throw away careers, families, lives for what's under your skirt.
i'm wearing pants.
i'm feeling superior because i have an arrow pointed at your jugular.
and the irony of using a phallic-shaped weapon....
not lost on me.
you don't have the nerve to do it.
wrong again.
he can't hurt me.
no, i won't hurt her.
i won't hurt her at all.
in here.
i figure it happened while he was working with billy's blood from that handprint.
that finger-painty-looking handprint downstairs is billy's blood?
wes turned into a psycho killer because of that bloody handprint that i picked up and looked at?
when you put it that way, it worries me.
i better get out of here.
lock the door behind me.
or maybe we'll go to plan b.
oh, god.
you said you'd go to plan b, but what's plan b?
plan b....
plan b....
plan b is the one where, if you don't stop whining, i bash in your--
oh, god.
cordy, get out of here.
all that rage and hatred bubbling to the surface.
please, go.
i can't.
i have this problem.
you think that's your problem?
you know what your real problem is?
guys like him!
'cause you got no power over me.
you're scaring me.
take this and knock me out.
you want me to hit you?
yes!
i can't.
you might want to.
hit me!
charles, please.
"""charles, please. "" fine."
you're gonna pay for that.
would you like to hear my theory, fred?
it's about how stupid you are.
i believe that after five years of living in a cave you'll instinctively retreat to small, dark places  rather than run outside, where you'd be safe.
let's finish this.
i'm sorry, wesley.
you're sorry?
you were right about me liking dark places to hide in.
but you forgot i also like to build things.
i don't get it either.
i mean, you're a man so why didn't billy's touch affect you?
maybe because i'm not human.
and a vampire can never be turned into a monster.
well, that thing that billy brought out in others?
it was always about the pain and the pleasure.
i guess you could say your demon-ness makes you less petty than humans.
almost noble.
i mean, in a twisted, dark and really disturbing kind of way.
it's weird.
what is?
i'm getting used to being creeped out and comforted at the same time.
i get that.
wesley, it's me, fred.
does that hurt?
i left a bunch of messages.
i'm so sorry.
wesley, you gotta come back to work.
how can you not?
but now it's time to come back.
fred.
something inside me was forced to the surface.
god, no.
it wasn't something in you, wesley.
it was something that was done to you.
i don't know what kind of man i am anymore.
well, i do.
you're a good man.
will i see you back at the office?
yeah.
good.
why would she risk all to fly from loving arms?
tomorrow we move for rome with crixus.
yet i would have you take with spartacus.
one fucking hare between us?
carry torch forward!
those who follow him are known by mark of the bull.
the eagle and the dolphin.
the mark of gnaeus pompeius magnus.
i thought pompey mired in hispania against the renegade sertorius.
if pompey's scouts return to the republic, as night follows day, the man and his legions will trail their shadow.
give voice if eyes fall upon movement upon flanks!
then we must nourish specter, so that it may reclaim flesh and promise of better days.
was his end as he had always dreamed?
the days after we parted were filled with victory.
the blood of our enemies turning fields to crimson mud, thick with the dead.
does he share fate with crixus?
to taunt spartacus with vision of his end.
crassus tempts to goad you into foolish action.
if i stood only for my own life, perhaps i would stand so moved.
his scouts were headed south, towards crassus' legions.
give word to break encampment as apollo approaches eastern sky.
a whore by the name of canthara, discovered beaten and slitas pig from womanhood to throat.
offer greeted with wondrous surprise.
i've never known pompey to support any cause but his own interests.
why does he not appear before us himself, if taken by such desire?
i will not risk journey.
nor will i break from my charge to bow and scrap before imagined titan.
you cannot seriously be turning offer upon mind?
pompey but seeks your knowledge of spartacus so that he may snatch victory from deserving hands.
and when moment presents, balance scale against those who have most deeply wounded heart.
and the warmth of flesh, yet among the living...
and give comfort to those left in death's wake.
each drop of roman blood spilled in honor of those taken from us.
joining me is professor charles eppes, a cal sci mathematician who frequently consults for the fbi.
are you here to help the fbi find bonnie parks?
for instance, we know miss parks' car was recovered at the san marino mall.
yeah, i counted 28 companies or individuals who have reason to go after her for revenge.
yeah, that's true, but each suspect is motivated to a different degree.
you know that carnival game where you shoot a squirt gun into a clown's mouth to fill up a balloon?
an asymmetric threat assessment allows us to measure the factorsthat feed motive in each suspect just like the mechanism in the game measures the flow of water into each clown's mouth.
we just have to find the one case in which motive has been fed to the point where the suspect eventually pops.
just as important are the people who are afraid of her, who she threatens.
ah, the filter pump's been making some horrible sounds lately.
hey, charlie.
relax, your dad mentioned the trouble the other day after class,
probably save money in the long run, do the planet a favor at the same time.
she's always real secretive during her investigations.
she would work along until it was time to start shooting.
i used to bunk with some of these guys in afghanistan.
she doesn't trust that they are secure.
i'll be fine by myself.
the guys at the lab had no problem pulling off what was on those pads we found in her office.
you know, you got a spouse, ex-spouse, you got an angry boyfriend.
yeah, yeah, i'm on my way down there right now.
hey, charlie, you have any idea who might have tried to do this?
because you were already so pissed off about my interview.
what happened shouldn't change anything.
it was november.
can we take this inside the office maybe?
nice going.
you and mom- you sacrificed so much for him to do something great, you know.
i started in this business swinging a hammer when i was 15.
and to the city, this thing makes taylor look like a big hero - bringing a revenue center to a formerly blighted area.
she's been talking with mostly poor local residents who've all been forced out to make room for the development, and they've been terrorized by taylor's thugs.
i'm still working on it.
downturn analysis would require that i know what i'm analyzing, and i don't, so that's the problem.
thought i'd throw my sales pitch at your dad.
so how sweet would it be to see the electric meter spinning backwards?
that's right, isn't it?
now i can't tell you how much longer she going to last like that.
you've either got a lot of guts or very little brains coming back here.
what i got is sonny leyva.
'cause you know when i find bonnie she's gonna finger sonny.
and there's no way that sonny's gonna be doing a kidnapping rap on his own.
when i was being held on that freighter and they had me handcuffed and lancer was sticking me with needles, there'one thing that kept me going.
that was knowing that my team was coming for me.
no matter how screwed up things had gotten, that you and david and megan and don were working hard and you were going to come through that door.
'cause i went through this exact same thing when i first saw combat in afghanistan.
yeah, ten-digit property id numbers, square footage,track numbers, assessed values,only they're all obscured.
if you apply force to a particular buoy pulling it down toward the bottom, that buoy will in turn exert a force on its neighboring buoys, pulling them down as well.
now at the same time, those neighboring buoys will help hold up the weighted buoy.
essentially, he was able to submerge the entire line of buoys.
that would save him millions as he bought back those properties.
hundreds of millions, potentially.
no way to know.
yep, that one, too.
it's nothing but a personal vendetta.
it's not just walls and roof shingles to me.
besides, the whole spirit of craftsman architecture was a belief that beauty and practicality were the same.
right behind you.
the thing is, do you think that... you know, i've been holding you back?
just... you know, doing something better.
okay, jake.
the world has gone crazy, huh?
we have lost contact with our forward recon patrols.
but we do know, based on the analysis of the vectoring of the disease is that it could be our ground zero for infection.
won't know till you get us a sample.
you will go in with special forces, find any survivors and retrieve a blood sample from the hyper sapiens before cruise missiles destroy the entire area at 0700.
and i don't need to tell you what will happen if 60 minutes gets ahold of this story.
sometimes they use us for dinner.
o'connor, kill that chatter.
so it's just going to go on and on.
mama!
megan.
you cannot fly, baby.
aw, mom!
mr. edick.
what are you doing here?
we need to talk, janet.
could we do this another time?
i'd rather my daughter...
you haven't been returning my phone calls.
that's why i've come to see you.
no flying.
how is it that you can find me in the middle of san francisco, and yet you can't find my husband?
your husband doesn't want to be found.
i told you that.
yeah, i told you i gave you all i could.
doesn't work that way, janet.
maybe it doesn't work that way because my husband's already paying you.
do you understand?
oh, yeah.
megan?
megan?
megan?
megan?
megan, answer me!
mommy?
mommy?
mommy?
megan.
megan?
hello?
please!
please.
i just want to see my little girl.
please?
please!
tell me if she's okay.
no nails.
help!
somebody help me!
please.
can you hear me?
listen, i know you're in there.
all right...
get back!
get a grip on yourself!
i'm not gonna hurt you.
i'm here to help.
who are you?
my name is joe.
okay?
i'm not one of them.
i don't know.
i woke up five minutes ago.
how did you get out of your room?
there's a key...
you don't have a key?
just relax.
you know why you're here?
why someone would do this?
i owe some people some money.
how much money?
about $1,100.
[ chuckles ] that seems like an awful lot of trouble to go to.
anyone else?
my husband.
what would your husband want with me?
well, where are we?
i don't know.
what's the last thing you remember?
i was in the park and...
where?
san francisco.
i was in new york.
let me see your hand.
i'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
just suck... suck on that.
i think i heard other people.
yeah, me too.
and we're gonna go find them.
you are?
yeah.
what's wrong?
what if it's the people that took us?
what if it is?
we could leave them.
of course, i could have left you.
hello?
can you hear me?
anyone?
speak up!
what is this place?
for god's sake, let me out!
listen to me.
all right, in your dresser, there's a bible.
all right, in the bible, there's a key.
look for a bible in the drawer next to the bed.
charlie morse.
capitol investments.
i'm joe.
it's not over.
if they want money, i've got it.
"still trying to figure out who ""they"" are."
give me a hand?
did i miss my wake-up call?
easy, easy, easy!
take it easy, soldier.
we're on your side.
you're a hostage too?
yeah.
we're all hostages.
it's okay.
i didn't think i drank that much.
you okay?
my standards must really be slipping.
hey, do you know where you are?
do you know what's happening?
i think i need to get to a phone.
come on.
where the hell are the guys that took us?
i'm not waiting around to find out.
[ clicking ] it's not working.
why don't they come and get us?
i don't get it.
that sort of behavior is contagious, sir!
you need to keep your powder dry.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
i'm just...
it's my wife.
if i'm not there to look after her, she'll...
i don't even want to think about what could happen.
hey, smoke detector.
those magnets should shut off if there's an alarm.
what are you saying?
i'm saying if we start a fire in here, we should be able to get out.
but if the doors don't open, then we're stuck in here.
anybody got any matches?
break that down as small as you can.
i mean splinters.
this is ridiculous.
i want something that jumps out and grabs the reader by the throat.
renbe, i'm dying to know.
i need one more confirmation.
is it who i think it is?
better.
you see this?
missing person at a playground in the park yesterday.
kiddie thief's hardly our bit.
it was the mom who got herself picked off.
never touched her kid.
mom abandons kid.
no, single mom.
good mom.
runs a daycare out of her house.
sound like the sort that...
well, if it's happened, it's happened in san francisco.
i got video.
oh, of course you've got video.
don't take me for granted, kat.
cops don't give up evidence like they used to.
a security camera caught the whole thing.
networks won't get this for the next few hours.
vague.
not vague.
tantalizing.
anybody claim her?
grandmother on the mother's side, but...
you're looking at me.
i'm looking at you.
your missing mom is gonna end up in a garbage bag, mark.
you know that.
you give me my transvestite first.
then you can have your missing mom.
i can't see a damn thing.
everybody think.
what's the last thing you remember?
i went to sleep last night like any other night, and i woke up here.
who would do this?
what are you worth?
worth?
crisis intervention for a teachers' union.
i make $38,000 a year.
i have $11,000 in an i.r.a.
soldier?
the corps doesn't pay much, sir.
what about you?
i'm not worth anything to anyone but me.
maybe, maybe not.
why do you think they would want to grab you?
i'd rather not say.
what do you do?
hey, no offense, but i don't know who you people are.
we're all sitting around wondering where the bad guy is.
how do you know the bad guy's not right here?
he's right.
any one of us could be one of them.
but joe's the only one i don't know anything about.
everybody is worth something to someone.
i mean, i have no money, no family.
i'm not worth anything to anyone.
life insurance, maybe?
none.
there's only one reason why someone is kidnapped, as far as i know.
not everyone is abducted for money.
right, sergeant?
are you saying someone's gonna cut our heads off?
it's hard to cut it off if you keep moving.
come on, come on.
right there.
someone grab that table over there.
here.
come on.
move!
move!
coming?
what the hell?
a hotel.
chinese food?
well, someone's been here.
hello?
dead.
hello?
all dead.
i don't get it.
a sheriff's office with no sheriff?
i wonder who's watching us.
wish they would just come get us.
this is almost worse.
we only have a few hours until dark.
you mean just walk?
till someone tries to stop us.
um, is that a gun rack?
nobody move!
what?
what do you want us to do?
get on the ground, okay?
do what he says.
get down!
okay, which one of you is in charge?
aren't you in charge?
[ chuckles ] so you're not them, huh?
you mean you're not them?
"lady, i don't know who ""them"" is, okay?"
hey, listen.
we were taken, same as you.
i don't know that.
get on the ground, okay?
look, i'm not gonna say it again!
if you want to shoot me... just do it.
i got nothing to lose.
all right?
get the gun!
get the gun!
get the gun!
hold him down.
all... all right.
i'm gonna keep squeezing until we get some answers now.
what's your name?
how do we get out of here?
i don't know.
red lights, anyway.
i woke up in that hotel over there.
you're the one.
i heard you walk past my room.
oh, was that you screaming for help?
you mean you just left her there?
hey, look, no hard feelings.
enough.
what do we do with this guy?
does it really matter?
he could be one of them.
okay.
now, who's with me?
i am.
who else?
we don't know what's out there.
so, what, we just stand here?
all i'm saying is, exercise caution.
wait until dark.
i'll take the gun and do a recon.
supposing you get capped out there in the dark?
i'm willing to take that risk.
well, that's your job, isn't it?
but then you'll be dead out there with the one weapon we have.
if that's how you feel...
listen, i'm not waiting for dark.
i'm going home right now.
you can stay here and watch the others.
who put the grunt in charge?
you did.
if i'm not back by tomorrow, do your recon.
i'll be back... with help.
no, no, no, no, no.
please don't go.
i have to go.
were you in the military, joe?
[ chuckling ] me?
you kidding?
where'd you get an idea like that?
things you say.
things you seem to know, like the way you signaled to that marine back there.
what line of work is that?
janet, you know, your daughter is probably perfectly fine.
my daughter is five, okay?
she has allergies and a special diet.
yeah, and if something happens to you out here...
okay, okay, but if something does happen to you, you have family, right?
i mean, your life sure can't seem to wait.
who's waiting for you back home?
that's right.
nothing that can't wait.
joe?
joe, can you hear me?
what happened?
just give it a minute!
we can't just let them lie out there.
nobody's getting left behind, but there's a way to do this.
okay.
okay.
do you think they were shot?
i didn't hear anything.
i don't see any blood.
there would be a lot of blood.
hey, let me go with you.
if i'm hit, you need to figure out where it came from.
okay.
mcnair!
this obviously is not working.
we got to go back.
get in here!
get in here!
let's go in here.
can you recall the last time you saw your daughter?
not for some time.
we've both been very busy.
she had her daycare, and i had my...
to be perfectly truthful, my daughter and i were not speaking to one another.
that is to say, she was not speaking to me.
until recently, i was cut out of her life completely.
i never even met her husband.
she felt that megan ought to know her grandmother, even...
she never felt i was a good parent.
"the word she used was ""abusive."""
but i never hit her.
one time.
i hit her with a hairbrush until it broke.
my daughter and i were...
well, we both are... very strong-willed, you see.
i found this in your room.
no.
no, she isn't mine.
then whose is it?
thank you, nana.
i can't wait when mommy gets home so i can show her.
yes, i am sure she will be thrilled.
now, take dolly upstairs and play.
i have to keep talking to mr. renbe.
go on.
go on.
if there is a silver lining to this, it's that i've been given a second chance.
a chance to be the parent i supposedly never was.
well, it is indeed a blessing.
thank you very much for your time, ma'am.
and don't worry about your daughter.
i'm sure she'll turn up in no time.
oh, i'm quite sure it will all end well.
general store is empty.
what about them?
they're just lying there.
it could be someone driving by.
yeah, the only someone ever.
you got to be kidding me.
oh, my god.
okay.
okay.
do you speak english?
i blinked my eyes, and i woke up in that van.
it was like...
you ever have demerol?
do what i said.
you heard me.
down to your skivvies.
come on.
e... excuse me?
you heard me.
do what i said.
if you were drugged, there should be marks.
okay, pants off.
hey, whoa, moira.
w... why don't you and joe just go get a room, huh?
yeah.
look at this.
what the hell is that?
put your clothes back on.
okay, everybody, pants off.
okay.
okay, eyes front, pervert.
we've all got one.
if i'm right, they're implants.
biometric implants.
they're used for administering medicine over extended periods of time, and they can be operated remotely.
oh, that's fantastic.
i'm guessing we're all carrying a load of tranquilizer around.
you know a lot about this stuff.
medication is my life.
can you get them out?
they feel pretty deep.
even if we had the tools to cut you open and sew you back up...
uh, you eat.
come.
please.

is anybody gonna eat that?
how do you feel?
it's the best damn chinese food i ever had.
i could eat it every day.
what if they took her?
what if my daughter is in a place like this?
don't think like that.
you don't understand.
i hope they took her.
then at least i'd know she'd be safe.
thank you.
you're supposed to let fate decide.
"""your wife is waiting for you."""
is anybody else here...
"""your judgment is a little off at this point."""
"""you will soon win some high prize or award."""
"""by helping someone else, you also help yourself."""
mine's in chinese.
moira?
mine's just numbers.
that's weird.
janet?
what?
what does yours say?
it just said, uh,
"""may the road rise to meet you."""
an irish fortune cookie?
are any other men here married?
she spun that thing.
you can't think that's specifically meant for you.
don't kill yourself over it.
did you enjoy your meal?
who the hell are you?
i'm the night manager.
at night.
is that gun loaded?
how long have you worked here?
i started last night.
then you would have seen who brought us here.
beg your pardon, ma'am, but you were already checked in when i started.
yesterday's register.
it says we checked in at 6:00 p.m.
that's right, ma'am.
excuse me, sir.
may i see your knife for a moment?
great.
here.
now, listen.
we've had a very long, very weird day.
well, i'm at your service, sir.
what would you like to...
where are we?
i'm afraid i don't know.
that is not an answer.
okay, charlie.
where did you come from?
behind the hotel.
i think she means before that.
a man called to tell me i had the job starting the next day.
and that didn't seem funny to you?
i'm used to it by now.
take a good look.
look closely, ladies and gentlemen.
that was me before.
you see?
and look at me now.
look at me now.
lmpossible as it may seem, that's me.
that's me, ladies and gentlemen!
and you're asking yourselves, how did he do it?
kiloaway!
how did he do it?
kiloaway!
and you're thinking at home, this guy is here to sell us kiloaway.
this guy is here to rave about how great it is.
wrong.
i'm not here to sell you kiloaway.
i'm not here to talk about kiloaway.
ladies and gentlemen, i'm not going to do it.
my name is enrique fresan and i'm a nutrition expert.
i'm here to tell you about the 4 step method.
let's start with step 1 .
bingo!
ladies and gentlemen, we have bingo.
that concludes this round.
that's me, ladies and gentlemen!
and you're asking yourselves,
how did he do it?
kiloaway!
what phase are you in now, the after-after?
you don't fit.
here we go.
smile for me.
come on, smile.
fucking fraud.
i don't treat people who want to lose weight, i treat people who want to find the cause of their obesity.
that's the only way to lose weight and keep it off.
i won't put you on a diet.
eat anything you like.
no more deadlines, no more frustration.
you have to find your own path, your own pace, without rushing.
the key is coming up with a plan together so we can help each other.
we'll ask each other questions and search for answers inside ourselves.
in short, we're going to expose ourselves.
so let's get started.
i'd like you all to stand up and take offyour clothes.
nobody should feel ashamed.
then you might as well leave.
honey, come on.
let's go.
i love being fat and naked.
like you guys are swimsuit models...
honey, please, let's go.
this must be a sect...
be quiet.
i'm not fat, i'm overweight.
four months ago i weighed 63 kilos.
then i started gaining weight.
one, two, three kilos...
a little diet and exercise and they'll come right off.
6, 7, 8, 9, 1 0...
works every time.
16, 17, 1 8, 1 9... 20.
twenty kilos.
i've had insomnia since i was ten, which means more hours in the day to do stuff, especially eat.
me too.
i have to take sleeping pills because if i wake up at night i start eating.
sofia, what are you doing?
what?
you should leave and let her stay.
you're not even fat.
i told you not to come along.
you insisted.
and just as well l did come along.
come on, get moving.
god!
what a pain!
okay, we can get started now.
let's get dressed.
what are you doing?
paula!
what are you doing?
making a window so we can see it.
see him or check up on it?
check up on it.
what ifwe need a little privacy?
privacy or sex?
we can hang a blind.
we'll have to soundproof it because of the noise.
wait, don't exert yourself.
no, i want to finish it!
no exerting myself, no sex.
you can rest and i'll do all the work.
hands off.
how's the new group?
did you take your clothes off?
you said you weren't going to.
yeah, but i get my speech going and i get carried away...
and now you're horny and wanna fuck.
yeah, more or less.
i don't know about you, but i'm going back.
i think we should mention it to the community.
ifyou already know, then that answers your question.
and not telling your parents about it should also give you a hint.
alex, i'm sick of it.
you're such a rebel, sofi.
we've never even seen each other naked.
that will come.
when, on our wedding night?
what ifyou suddenly don't like me?
last summer in salou we saw each other in bathing suits.
that's not the same.
yes, it is.
then let's do it right now.
yeah.
your parents will be here any minute.
then we'd better hurry.
let me take off this button.
come on.
how do i have to say it?
fine, but i'm going to.
she has to get her way.
sofia, no...
i don't understand this at all.
suddenly you're so worried about your physical appearance.
this can't go on.
"you are not your own."" corinthians, 6:1 9-20."
romans, 12:1 .
your turn.
the lady wants to see me?
you wanna see me?
you're gonna see me.
there you have it.
not all of it.
yes, all of it.
that christ gives me the creeps.
it's so small and wrinkled.
that means you don't like me.
it's not that, i'm just nervous.
well, yeah.
l really don't know if...
you see, sofi?
some things are wrong in god's eyes.
my great grandfather desiderio...
my grandfather vicente...
my uncle paco...
my father emilio...
my older brother fede.
and they all died under 50 from obesity-related diseases.
i can't even see my dick when i pee.
i've seen it and it looks just fine.
just fine.
every inch, every inch, every inch!
copying files...
what are you doing with my cell?
i'll give it back, fat ass.
give it to me.
beat it.
i said give it to me!
careful, you're so fat you might have a heart attack!
you're so selfish!
stop!
what's going on here?
this selfish cunt won't let me use her phone.
try and be polite.
ifyou want her phone, say please.
may i please use your cell phone, my twin sister the fat fucking sea cow?
over my dead body, you flaming little turd.
very good.
communication comes first.
connection error
this is the story of how my partner screwed up my life.
don't think, just do as i say!
because you're a pest, a schmuck, a lowlife!
that's what you are, a pest that won't go away!
a sewer rat!
idiot!
where are you going?
pictures of me appeared in a couple magazines, on tv... and sales dropped.
the whole night costs 1 ,000 euros.
1 ,000 euros?
i'll show you what things are worth.
how about a personally autographed poster?
then more pictures of me in magazines, and i got even fatter, ate more and worried more.
and more and more...
sure enough, my partner sued me and got the judge to freeze all my accounts as a precaution.
do those pills work?
they don't affect your mood.
it's not my fault you're fat, asshole!
they give you energy for the daily routine.
and the others?
how does being overweight affect you at work?
i used to work in a mall, promoting a new brand of perfume.
but you'd think i was selling poison rather than perfume...
my name is sofia, how can i help you?
now i'm working in telemarketing for a large company.
my name is sofia, how can i help you?
i'm too fat to chase bad guys, so i examine dead guys.
one night i was examining a corpse at casa isaac, a really fancy restaurant i'd always wanted to try.
it got stuck in his throat and he choked to death.
the maitre'd gave him the heimlich, but by the time he got the ring out it was too late.
the ring had an inscription i couldn't quite make out.
i was curious and... i licked it clean.
it was without thinking.
it was a reflex.
the problem is, i liked it.
it tasted like fresh oysters and galician wine.
i'm curious, what did the inscription say?
"""l'll love you even in the afterlife."""
how appropriate.
how does being overweight affect you at work?
i work at home, so it doesn't.
i create internet protocols and system codes.
let me get this straight.
my boyfriend's an engineer too.
we'd go to the gym, ate healthy food, fucked all the time...
he has no idea and i won't tell him.
a telecom expert without a webcam?
i don't fucking want one.
why don't you just tell him?
why don't you just help me lose 20 kilos?
when does he get back?
in five months.
don't worry, if he's in the u.s. he'll come back as fat as a pig.
is it working yet?
not yet, in a minute.
come by later and i'll give you a special treat.
did you go see her after?
no, of course not.
maybe you should have.
it's not only about saving ourselves.
it's about saving others too, or at least trying to.
i'll go back if i have to.
don't you trust alex?
but i don't like him seeing beautiful naked women.
maybe that's why he doesn't want to see me naked.
sofia, please...
there are more effective ways to get acquainted.
why is anything to do with sex so bad and wrong?
you just have to wait for the right time, the right reason and the right place.
while you're at it, tell them about that sect you joined.
they do some weird stuff.
oh, come on!
always the same.
hey, show a little team spirit.
20-1 5, set point for the blue team.
let's go, you look asleep out there!
yeah, let her go!
she's undernourished.
i don't think so.
fine.
samuel, your service.
come on, get that fat ass in gear already!
luis, one more joke out ofyou and you'll fail this course.
let's go!
you fat fuck.
i'd smack you but i don't want to get lard on my hands.
pass it over here, let's go.
when you're bored?
when you're stressed?
when you're satisfied?
which means all day long.
i have a cupcake, another cupcake, i switch to chocolate, another cupcake, then i have lunch, first course, second course, dessert, a snack, then dinner, and just before bedtime a tiny piece of chocolate.
isn't that what everybody expects from me?
"""look, he's fat again."""
i feel... guilty.
i've found a pretty effective method to deal with this subject.
sharing.
you mean fatten up the people around you.
no, it's not that...
one for you, one for me.
come on, sweetie, eat up.
it's your birthday cake.
she's breaking with the routine.
you sick fucking asshole!
you two are really unbearable today.
time for your presents.
this is for you, and this is for you.
a laptop...
what crap is this?
an automatic sequencer for analyzing dna samples.
you can be like dad.
it was broken so i fixed it up for you.
how unbelievably lame!
don't be so ungrateful.
since we knew you wouldn't like it, we bought you this.
you put the electrodes around your body and it hardens the loose areas.
it better have a zillion electrodes!
a cell phone!
it has a video camera and everything, so you won't bother your sister.
more megapixels than yours, fat ass.
eat up, sweetie.
just use your body shaper after and you're all set.
guess where l am right now.
i'm getting on a plane.
where to?
teo, teo!
teo, come here!
teo!
teo, come!
teo!
teo, sweetie.
you see this here?
it joins the amniotic sac to the uterus.
you could lose the baby.
what do i have to do?
paula, how do you feel about spending the rest ofyour pregnancy in bed?
hold on...
ready?
one, two... and three.
what is this?
the bed, the mattress is dutch latex.
a gift from my mom.
that's not a mattress, that's two mattresses.
no, look.
they fit together with this zipper.
of course, you wouldn't know... or your mom.
not my mom again.
you are really...
want another one?
lt is pretty comfortable.
and we'll fit on one mattress.
you really didn't get excited at that sex shop the other day?
no.
you're the only one i like.
i'm scared.
ofwhat?
you might get tired of me.
that doesn't mean a thing.
it means i love you more than anything else.
l'm ugly, fat and disgusting.
i don't believe you, i don't...
how can i prove it to you?
you never touch me.
yes, i do.
what am i doing now?
that's not touching.
yes, it is!
that's not touching, alex.
this is touching.
and said abraham:
genesis,
chapter 24.
the right moment, the right reason, and the right place.
don't tape me!
run, fatso, run.
keep going.
what the fuck do you want?
no need to sue me for that.
i never saw you run before this lawsuit.
it's obvious you needed a little push.
you're fucking garbage and you'll never be able to hurt me.
so get lost, you slime.
i sold the penthouse.
you sold my penthouse?
you have a week to move out.
son of a bitch!
i'm not moving out, you got that?
what are you doing?
don't pull a number on me here.
get up, there are people around.
jesus...
help!
help...
are you more relaxed now?
well, yeah, i don't know.
should we do it again?
the sin is already done.
that's true.
maybe this time you'll last long enough to stick it in.
though for that we should use protection.
the mattress is wrapped in plastic.
it won't get stained.
alex...
that's not what i mean.
ifwe go through with this, we face the consequences.
okay.
you suffered a minor angina.
it was just a scare.
what about the other guy?
you know him?
he's my partner.
he had a severe trauma injury to the cranium.
it's provoked an aneurysm and severe cardiac arrest.
we've managed to stabilize him, but he's probably suffered major brain damage.
enrique...
oh, jesus!
my jesus!
what happened to him, enrique?
i'm going to die!
what have they done to him?
do it now.
have the balls to do it now.
i know you're going to dump me.
because i'm fat.
because you won't want to be with someone fat like me.
because you always hated fat people.
so i'm asking you please, dump me now.
don't touch me.
stop it.
stop it!
in these last 5 months i haven't left the house.
i've done nothing but work and eat.
i've had no life, because german is my life.
i don't feel like doing anything without him.
you can't spend your whole life with only one man.
i haven't tried different things, i haven't lived, i haven't experimented.
for 12 years i've felt like i was missing out on my life.
i got fat because i wanted him to dump me.
dump me, dump me, dump me!
i went for a jog and my partner came to cheer me on.
suddenly i heard a noise, i turned, and there was a man struggling with my partner.
i think he was robbing him.
he pushed him and ran off.
i tried to get help, but... evidently my heart gave in.
did you see the man who robbed him?
no.
it was very dark.
know anybody your partner had problems with?
no.
one last question.
you're the kiloaway guy, right?
kiloaway rules!
kiloaway rules!
kiloaway rules!
kiloaway rules!
kiloaway!
kiloaway!
kiloaway!
look at yourselves, please.
in the privacy ofyour homes, in front of the mirror.
if the answer is yes, forget what the doctors say, forget what society says.
stop feeling inferior.
forget my method, forget my kiloaway pills.
let's move on to step 2.
step 2:
losing weight doesn't matter, what matters is how you feel.
how would you describe it in one word?
light.
happy.
i feel like crap.
let's see if the way you feel is associated with your weight.
12 kilos lighter.
i beat the happy nun.
apparently sofia is the only one whose weight-loss matches how she feels.
why do you think you lost weight?
i don't know, i have been more active these last couple months.
i had a goal and a motivation.
but i think it's really because i feel more satisfied spiritually.
much more.
i ran the water a little colder, it's better for your heart.
you wouldn't believe the fuss the neighbors made about the ramp.
we have to help each other in life.
i put your clothes in the closet.
i was tired of seeing them scattered everywhere.
what a disaster!
i'll go get them.
what is this?
i went over all the exams personally.
i couldn't believe it either.
what happened?
eat shit, fat ass!
i failed one less than you!
asshole.
the only subject you didn't fail is p.e.
that teacher must really like you.
paula, what's the matter?
i can't put on my pants.
why put them on ifyou know they won't fit?
because they fit me before and i wanted to look nice for you.
you look gorgeous.
i'm going to break this fucking mirror.
all day looking at yourself...
look at my tits, they're huge.
they're beautiful.
you don't like big tits.
don't lie to me.
l'm so scared.
listen to me for a second.
no, paula. i'm not.
you're sick ofyourself.
how many women 6 months pregnant have you seen who look better?
all of these.
look, they all say how wonderful it feels to be pregnant.
i expected something different.
you can't do this every day.
this is absurd.
i know.
silly, you didn't invite anyone over?
put something on.
i told my parents i want you to be my tutor.
i can't stand being in class or at home.
i can't stand being anywhere.
you're the only one who's nice to me and has a bigger belly.
you can't move, right?
i can do your shopping, keep you company, do some cleaning...
you want political asylum?
a little bit.
get your homework out.
how's the new p.e. teacher?
he's a jerk.
he makes us run non-stop.
but i just walk, like i did with you.
i just keep it handy in case my blood sugar drops.
your blood sugar drops?
hand it over.
open the book.
hand over the candy.
open the book.
is it fixed?
yeah, all set.
if it breaks down again, i'll stick it up your ass.
now appearing in cabin 3, erika...
erika...
hi, sweetie.
how was work?
fine.
that guy looked at your ass.
who, carlos?
how exciting!
i don't find it amusing.
you are.
no.
does that seem right to you?
would you like me to notice other girls?
you wouldn't, right?
i don't find it amusing either.
because i'm not well.
all i can think about is having sex with you.
over and over again.
i see you dressed like that and...
we could stop by the house before the word.
have they brought more furniture?
we're sexjunkies.
no, we're love junkies.
pilar...
we have to start sleeping separately.
no, i can't sleep alone, it scares me.
fine, but i have to move out and find an apartment.
you need somewhere to stay and someone to take care ofyou.
pilar!
the doctor said i'm fine, to lead a normal life.
what's the problem?
you're my partner's wife.
we can't be here playing the happy couple.
fine, but you're gay.
nothing will happen.
besides, we were friends before i met jesus.
remember that time in college when we slept together?
how gross!
that's the day i knew for sure i was gay.
jesus hadn't fucked me in 14 months.
i think maybe he was a little gay.
pilar, not there.
l'm horny.
close your eyes and pretend i'm a guy.
no!
one of those super hot little boy toys you fuck for 300 euros.
let's see what happens.
use your teeth a little.
that's it, gently, careful...
until she bent over and gave me a blowjob.
did you get an erection?
how did you feel?
a blowjob is a blowjob.
you'll enjoy the experience as much as i did.
what about her?
did you do anything to her?
like what?
like what she did to you.
no, gross!
one question, mr. therapist.
isn't it a bit irregular for you to discuss personal issues in a bar?
having a beer can bring out things that don't come out naturally in therapy.
like your heterosexual encounters.
that happy nun really puts me off.
always so happy, talking about her cupcake and another cupcake and another cupcake...
what a pain!
i think i just saw leonor walk out.
i swear i think it was her.
another one!
what happened to the voracious executive?
i don't know.
one day she showed up at the wrong group.
sorry, i think i got the time wrong.
not the time, the day.
and she never came back.
i called her and she didn't answer.
after that she sent me a message saying she was quitting.
potato chips anyone?
here, take one.
what was our agreement?
i'm only offering a potato chip.
if he wants one he'll take one.
eating alone makes me feel guilty.
you said to free ourselves from guilt.
freeing yourself is one thing, burdening others is another.
give me the fucking chip!
no more guilt.
feel better?
much better.
how long are we going to stare at the pizza?
all that will get me is a cold pizza.
"spare me the ""l'm a fat social outcast so i can eat whatever i want"" excuse."
i don't want to hear it anymore, you got that?
oh, but your excuse is okay.
yes, i can.
what's this?
tickets to raise funds for the school trip.
you haven't sold any.
i'm not going to the party or taking the trip.
samuel isn't going?
i don't think so.
what a shame, it looks so good.
come on, like my dad says.
one for you, one for me and everyone's happy.
okay.
sure, only the fattest kid in class would ever like me.
the fat couple, how nice.
"""how nice."" do you like him?"
he's clumsy, ridiculous, absurd, a total loser...
he's great.
send him a message and you can eat a slice.
three slices or no deal.
two and i get the candy in your bag.
there's no candy in my bag.
okay, okay.
not the big one, the small one.
you're not eating?
i don't eat crap.
you never mentioned him.
he's learning spanish and he's becoming a good christian.
he's going to sing us a religious song from his country.
all right?
take it away, champ.
i dedicate song to friend sofia.
so marry she me.
how pretty.
imagine me walking down the aisle, towards the altar, to this music.
no, we'll get a proper choir.
a choir could make nice background music.
ifyou won't let me have a goatee, you can forget this music.
it sounds like tarzan.
spoilsport.
okay, therapist.
sure you don't want to close your eyes and go with the flow?
no, but only because i'm your therapist and it wouldn't be ethical.
goodbye then.
can i have another beer?
i see you brought your boyfriend.
he's not my boyfriend, jerk-off.
he's crazy about you, he told me.
i just talked to him and he said you're amazing.
i hate alcohol.
loosen up, you'll get the hang of it.
all right!
i hate alcohol too.
hi.
pilar, what are you doing here?
the pills don't work without you next to me.
you don't belong here.
why not?
i can help you score, silly.
there's a much less tiring way.
paying.
why would you pay for sex?
you can get someone who will really love you.
i don't want to love anybody, okay?
that's because you haven't found the right person.
i'm not right for anybody, pilar.
go on.
pilar, i'm gay, all right?
i like men, don't you see?
get the fuck out!
get out!
what?
i can't hear you.
remember when you'd get home late and i'd pretend i was asleep and you'd fuck me anyway?
yeah, i remember.
i saw my gynecologist today.
you know, normal life.
okay.
it'll give me something to do tomorrow.
relax, i'll be right in.
you want me to fall asleep.
i'm asking you to get into bed with me.
and i'm telling you i'm going to clean up first.
paula?
your folks don't help you control your brother?
my folks only care about themselves and their perfect marriage.
all they do is fuck all day long.
yuck!
you'll have to learn to defend yourself.
i saw a rat poison on the internet that apparently has no taste.
paula, if she's staying, i'll sleep on the sofa.
you were going to anyway.
come on, put it away.
one for you...
go on.
and one for me.
good, isn't it?
ever since i was a kid, i felt different.
i didn't like hitting on girls or playing soccer or any of that stuff.
because ifyou're fat and a loner, nobody asks why you're not doing what everybody else does.
nobody would realize i was gay, or i wouldn't realize.
but i didn't give in to my confusion until the special olympics in '92.
they let me volunteer, miraculously,
and put me with the swimmers.
there was this incredibly handsome australian who'd cling to me when i'd pull him up out of the pool because he had no legs.
i don't know which made me happier, his smile up there in his wheelchair when he won the bronze medal or when he popped my cherry.
my first love was an amputee.
i'm tired of being gay.
really tired.
we're supposed to be sensitive, happy, vivacious, tolerant...
the avant-garde of humanity.
and that's not me.
i can't wait all night for the miracle.
leave.
you have to pay me anyway.
i'm a fraud.
i'm the worst faggot of all time.
i'm a lying, bitter, violent whoremonger.
and now i'm a contradiction.
contradictions aren't necessarily a bad thing.
they can always be explained by something that we're not yet ready to face.
that's why it's better not to run from them, but to face them and see where they lead us.
because those very contradictions are what reveal the answer we're looking for.
place your hands on your bellies.
close your eyes.
let's all try to breathe together.
inhale...
breathe in, breathe out.
i thought it was my pregnancy, but now i see i'm the problem.
we all have contradictions.
they serve as a necessary first step to figuring out the things we want or don't want in life.
what is it that limits you, but you worship?
i break the machine on purpose so i can go back.
i break it.
what is it you worship but repress?
what is it you repress but sets you free?
what is it that sets you free but condemns you?
what is it that condemns you but you love?
what is it you love but you reject?
are you fucking me because you want to, or because you want to keep pretending everything's fine?
society wants you to be fat.
everyone will feel better ifyou're fat because they'll feel superior.
not anymore.
it's time to take that first step.
grab the reins ofyour life.
a single gesture can help change the dynamic.
but one day of euphoria isn't enough, one bottle of kiloaway isn't enough.
kiloaway doesn't work miracles.
it's the crucial support you need on the long, hard road to success.
and believe me, there's only one road to success.
let's move on to step 3.
white, pure and clear.
1 1 kilos lighter.
darkbrownalmostshit.
14 kilos lighter.
once again, i beat the happy nun.
should we pick a wildflower that describes us, or a floating astronaut or a tropical bird in the amazon jungle?
i don't like big tits
let's see.
your glucose level is high.
it's not quite pathological, but you have to be careful.
you could get gestational diabetes.
your blood pressure has gone up.
no wonder, after what you just said.
don't worry, paula.
everything will be fine.
you just have to watch what you eat.
ifyou weren't always with that girl...
what did you say?
nothing, sorry.
what are you doing, you fucking fat ass?
you can use blood, hair, fingernails, body fluids, etc.
a sample is taken to obtain cells which are mixed with proteolithic enzymes and detergents to separate the dna.
years ago this process took up to several weeks.
today, with this machine, it can be done in less than 24 hours.
that means half the grade is for me.
we're siblings and fraternal twins, so the last 4 digits... these and these... should match.
i wasn't at all self-conscious.
i even had a great-looking boyfriend.
the thing is, he wasn't in the community.
i tried to get him in, but he wasn't much into spiritual stuff.
i mean, he didn't want to stay a virgin until he got married.
so he got tired ofwaiting and dumped me.
i got extremely depressed, but then alex showed up.
actually, alex was there all along.
two egg rolls, fried rice, shrimp noodles and mushu pork.
do you have french fries?
one serving.
i'll have a salad with bean sprouts.
i got really fat when i started going out with alex.
but i think i can still go down a size.
what for?
you need to eat, you're big-boned.
that's why i brought you to a chinese restaurant.
let me eat what i want.
it'll never work.
what happened to your cousin when she lost all that weight going to the gym?
look at her now, she weighs more than before.
cover yourself, sofia, for god's sake.
this is how girls wear them.
since when?
come on, you like it.
sure you do, look.
you love it.
you always get your way.
you force me to make a scene.
i'm not hungry anymore.
see what you did?
you ruined my appetite.
sofi, really...
you're such a rebel.
how can i eat more than all ofyou together without getting fat?
i looked around and the only pictures i can find are ofyou two with fat ass.
you were underweight and your sister was a bit over.
fat bitch fucked up my life from the start.
you have lots of baby pictures.
i only found one.
and i was 3 years old.
well, being adopted wouldn't be such a big deal.
family isn't a biological issue, it's a sentimental one.
quit fucking around!
don't say that stuff.
i'll freak out and run away from home.
hallelujah.
luis, you're not adopted.
what about the dna test?
not if performed properly.
nuria probably forgot to make hybrids of the samples.
i did, i put them in the thermo mix, steam cycle.
how did you transfer the fragments to the nitro cellulous membrane?
in the oven, wrapped in aluminum foil, 30 minutes at medium temperature.
ten out of ten.
how did this man do it again?
thanks to what?
thanks to me.
pilar, i'm rehearsing.
that way i can fuck you hard.
it's very nice ofyou to think of my anal needs.
you don't like it...
sure i do.
it's a nice big dick.
wanna give it a try?
that's our routine now.
we bring him chocolates, but since he obviously can't eat them, we do.
then i puke.
then a movie, we share a super combo.
then i super puke.
then we go to dinner, a little champagne, a nice view...
and i... puke.
then she consoles me.
then i console her.
i'm going to die!
why do you think you're puking so much?
i've arrived at the conclusion that for some reason food doesn't stay long in my body.
i used to follow the natural course of digestion, but suddenly it's working backwards.
i know what you're thinking, therapist.
don't you get tired of the charade?
don't you get tired of reality?
my life feels normal for the first time.
just like you coming here only tojustify yourself so you can keep eating like a pig.
slash- imprisoning herself with a guy who doesn't deserve her.
is something wrong, paula?
what is this?
explain yourself.
we'd better discuss it later.
no, we're going to discuss it right now.
i don't care ifyou are!
it's your fault i'm depressed all day.
does he treat the rest ofyou like this?
does he throw your food away?
does he make you feel like shit?
or is that just for me?
explain to me why i feel you don't love me, you don't like me, that i make you sick!
you don't know how much i hate you.
and you, take care ofyour fucking kids.
now we know your charade, therapist.
"""and light came into the world..."
"""because he who does evil abhors the light, shuns it, that his deeds may go unpunished."""
stop, stop.
what are you doing?
don't stop.
it's my turn, not yours.
your turn for what?
since when do you have more than one tingle?
first you wanted to be on top, now you want two tingles.
what next?
i don't know, we'll find out.
have you been touching yourself?
is that why you stay in the bathroom for so long?
stop it.
are you crazy?
don't mess with me.
hey, come here.
don't be silly.
you made me do everything!
fuck!
look at how angry you make me.
you think i like being like this?
look at the state i'm in.
you think it's okay?
look at me, sofia.
look at me.
you think i want this?
no, my love.
i look at you and you look filthy.
filthy, filthy, filthy!
you look...
piece of shit machine.
what are you doing?
trying to make it work.
drowning it won't help.
tell me the truth, dad.
i want to know the truth.
being thin doesn't mean you're not in this family.
you're disgusting, fat and ugly, but you're smart, like mom, like nuria.
you always treat me like an idiot.
i don't fit in this shitty family.
look, i'll repeat the test to prove it to you.
but luis, you're very clever.
there isn't a stupid bone in your body.
what the fuck?
i need it for the test.
i should pluck hair offyour balls.
what a smart son i have!
i've been with you for ten years.
as soon as things got difficult?
or is this what got difficult?
am i what got difficult?
the therapist who treats fat people can't stand the sight of his fat wife.
you brought your work home with you.
look at me.
you can't even look at me.
you don't like me anymore?
tell me.
tell me what got difficult.
i don't want to look at you!
i love you with all my heart and i can't imagine my life without you.
i feel like the biggest shithead in the world.
because you are.
"it's called ""letter to my love."""
"""nicodemus asked jesus,"
'how can a man be born when he is old.
john 3:4.
now the part i wrote.
"""sofi, i know i can't be born again, i can't go back in time to fix my mistakes."
all i can do is learn from them to become stronger and not make them again.
you're the person i want to learn how to be better and happy with.
to embark together on the road to adventure and salvation.
that's my alex.
so we agree?
yes, we agree.
everything like before?
everything like before.
no sex until the wedding.
and my tingles?
okay.
and you'll get fat again.
what?
you said it: everything like before.
don't i look better now?
of course you do.
that's why i said it.
to deliver us from temptation.
jerk!
you've been bringing me down all along, making me think i can't do any better.
i'm ashamed to be with you.
i'm so glad this happened today, because i truly realize i never want to see you again.
filthy!
jesus?
i'm sorry, jesus.
who goes first, me or you?
you go first.
dump me, dump me, dump me!
i dumped him.
i love you, but i don't love you.
these relationships create a lot of dependency.
so we decided to stay friends.
and while we were at it, we fucked.
it was typical goodbye sex.
i didn't feel fat.
i felt pretty and attractive.
light and wild.
suddenly i started having my doubts.
maybe breaking up wasn't a good idea.
so we decided to stay together.
that very same night, the insomnia and the anxiety came back.
and he wasn't there to comfort me.
i felt so awful and so in need of therapy that i came on the wrong day.
sorry, i think i got the wrong time.
not the time, the day.
i came to the bar.
i didn't want to go home.
suddenly i realized there was a man who wouldn't stop looking at me.
i thought he was marveling at how fat i was and i wanted to leave.
i asked the waiter for the bill but he said the man had paid for my drink.
and suddenly, i don't know how, he was sitting right beside me.
we were drinking whisky instead of coffee.
he kept telling me how pretty i was and he looked good to me too.
and i remembered what i said about trying new things, experimenting with other men, and i felt so in need of a little consolation...
that's how i met the second guy i ever fucked.
and what can i say?
it was better than any therapy session.
i felt desired, i didn't feel fat.
of course the following week i went right back to feeling fat and disgusting and unable to stop eating.
i needed to be consoled...
consoled and consoled hard.
that's how i met the third guy i ever fucked.
but something told me you weren't going to approve of my conduct.
your opinion may not mean much to me, but i guess i wasn't ready to hear it.
let's go.
where?
to london to meet your wife and kids.
where do you fucking think?
and that's how i met the fourth guy i ever fucked.
who like the second and third, was handsome and happily married.
so i decided to keep fucking handsome, happily married men for three reasons:
that's why i wanted no strings attached.
this morning i was convinced it would never happen again.
what is it that convinced you?
it was when german was getting back.
i think that's why i slept with all those men.
i thought it would be easier to get over german.
if he wouldn't dump me for gaining 20 kilos, maybe he would for fucking 20 guys.
as you can see, i get anything i decide to go after.
and what have you decided to go after?
i really don't know.
i don't know if i'd rather ask you to help me or to fuck me.
or to help me by fucking me.
because as far as i know, you're handsome and happily married.
how about you, how are things?
jesus!
i loved you so much!
paula!
pregnant lady, are you there?
the ice cream is melting!
paula!
hi, this is abel.
at first i couldn't figure out why a handsome, happily-married man would sleep with a fat girl.
i often wondered.
until one day i stopped wondering.
so don't worry, i'm not going to ask you.
what's wrong?
you fucked it all up.
everything.
luis, it was a joke.
if i let yourjokes get to me like this, i'd have killed myself.
i'm glad you're not my fat-ass twin sister.
quit whining.
of course we're twins.
not ifwe have different fathers.
what?
twins can't have different
you screwed up good this time!
tell me who it is!
tell me!
tell me!
what is it?
what's happening?
tell her who her father is.
you're my father.
tell her at least!
tell her who he is!
she deserves to know who her father is!
tell her who you were fucking instead of me!
my whole life, putting up with you!
and putting up with this shitty life!
hi, this is abel.
please, come.
i'm really scared.
what are you doing, pilar?
trying to put on his wedding ring, but it doesn't fit.
he bloated up while he was in a coma.
forget it.
listen to me.
go home and take one of those pills you like with a glass ofwarm milk.
you've been through a lot emotionally.
what are you doing?
let me try it.
he'd like that.
marry me.
what?
from the funeral straight to the wedding chapel?
you have to think it through.
i have for a while now.
marry me, please.
why would a good-looking, smart and affectionate woman marry a homosexual?
well, i mean, me.
i don't get it.
my love for you is true.
i don't even know ifyou love me a little bit.
i live for you.
only for you.
marry me.

"uploading ""fatsos fucking"""
in 1 0 years i never asked you to be perfect, because you already were.
you were perfect for me.
we were perfect for each other.
we had it all.
i know that only comes along once in a lifetime.
i'll be in the hospital for 3 days.
when i get out, i want you gone.
you know too much of anything is bad.
today we were discussing the role of the man and the woman in marriage.
it may seem obvious, but it's trickier than you might think.
no, my love...
please, don't...
don't go!
come, pray with me!
sofia, what's wrong?
somebody do something!
please!
you have to do it yourself.
but the only thing you can really trust is yourself.
you and you alone will taste victory.
step 4.
i never gave a shit about my kids.
i even felt like they were intruders, only there to annoy and get in the way.
so what's the big deal if one of them isn't mine?
i shouldn't care, right?
i should be glad.
i turned 50 yesterday.
i never thought i'd live that long.
i wasn't wrong.
even dead i can't lose weight.
i've spent 3 months camping out, obsessed with finding nuria's real dad.
i performed dna tests on our family, friends and neighbors.
i even got a sample from my deceased brother fede, who took long walks with beatriz after lunch instead of taking a nap when we spent sundays in the country.
