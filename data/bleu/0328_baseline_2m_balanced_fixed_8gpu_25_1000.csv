michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, buster was her brother, who she shared her bed with.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think we should sleep together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i'll tell him
i need to write an essay of at least 000 words... about the morals of war and the preemption of a conflict.
i'm not sure our vice teacher would like me to cheat while i'm trying.
so, you passed my ethics test.
as a matter of fact, george michael was desperately burned by his teacher... in hopelessly, hopelessly.
even the hands of the small-time crime... can be crushed.
no ring ring ring
try to remember everything she says about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
the g.d.k.'s eye was upon us.
your father thought it would make us look more charitable.
he must have copied my signature.
'maybe a year ago,'maybe i'll have a son who finishes his cottage cheese!
you have to get me out of this.
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't take care of her
and i no longer have the compassion and milk of a mother.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm offering you an olive branch here.
yes-yes.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
by the way, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
why am i telling you this?
i guess there are some things you can't tell your father.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to arrange his teacher to help him fulfill his motherhood.
there's nothing wrong with that.
however, i must say i'm a little hurt that you didn't think of me about it.
halos can carry out this mission.
and the teachers can keep it up.
one day, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay's never been so proud of what she said all her life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i keep telling you about.
girl, really... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma," you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache
yeah.
but gob mistook michael's kindness for reflection... and felt he was fighting to get involved.
because, you know, beyond adorable... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
_
and george sr. was about to get a surprise visit.
i read all your teachings and bought all your tapes.
and i watched it all again.
george sr. had recently offered a series of tapes... to make money for his new discovery of spirituality that he had recently offered to a series of people... who had suggested the solution to
i also lost two pounds by eating your banana bluth jail bars.
i've come to find out where
this is a nice place to start.
and michael met lindsay at parent-teacher night after getting rid of two girls she's been dating.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this rape room have the same floor plan with our kitchen?
i think she's perfect for you.
i thought it would help you get the concept of motherhood out of your head.
besides, i can't hurry up and marry someone just because my son wants to.
i'm mrs. baerly, the ethics
my aim is to make my students understand the importance of life... which could be lost... by a thoughtless stroke of trigger.
and michael got to know his son's ethics teacher.
that's the "rrrr" part of it.
you know, so annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you were laughing.
"rrr!" - "rrrr!" - "rrr
but, you know, like,......
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite a drink?
or... or...
yeah, he's dead
i think that mr. daniels had a stroke...
let's go get a drink.
yeah, maybe it will help.
george sr. was dealing with his own admirer.
i've already told you many of my sins.
maybe you could tell me a few sins.
well, there are legal indicators that show my sins.
but, back to your sins.
tell me one of the things that happened about this... again at the university dormitory.
and what is it with miss bayerly, who is today's second date...
michael, this little korean, and i don't know what to do with him.
at least, i think it's him.
you have to strip her down to the pants to say something definite.
yes, mother.
they'll take her back.
don't take your shoes off, little sir!
don't take your shoes off!
he's out of
who is it?
this is "annongong," your father and i have adopted.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you find a new son?
lucille buster realized she was concerned, even jealous.
and she understood how it felt to be ignored.
annyong is your brother now your brother,
call it off.
it stays.
listen, i'll call you back.
nice driving.
are you making dinner reservations?
a "little korean" made it.
and after their date....
michael took a step he hadn't taken in
okay, you think this is a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we get inside without waking everyone up?
this may not be my best idea so far.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i loved.
and i took someone you loved.
i'm "nashbaggerbagerlajam"...
listen, i know you're trying to get revenge on marta case.
i was lying to you when i said i wouldn't try to sleep with her, so...
she has to accept that.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
really, i had a chance to get rid of him.
it's ok
so romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden"?
hi, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i didn't know it was real.
but now... your eth teacher...
yeah, i did that for her.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, as a matter of fact, i'm sure you're interested in her.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
about the class?
i mean, she loved him... that he loved
hi, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was she doing here?
michael knew he had a moral obligation to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with her.
well, why would she do that?
why did she sleep with my ethics teacher?
you and i know that, but gob is new...
he's not one of the good snipers who's aiming for his target, and he's
you know, but listen, did you really think she was...?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
she's been accompanying a bunch of different dances... and i thought i'd go up to her and do something... with a joke...
"hey, you wanna dance?"
and that's what i thought was gonna happen, "so what?" okay?
i did it differently in the mirror, but...
but, you know, you know, like, we're dancing with jokes or something.
i didn't think so details.
don't you think you should go out with someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i defaced a book that was difficult to find a picture of saddam disappointment in the bathroom suite.
"what would saddam do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, here's the same exact way our fire escape.
in prison, george sr. was preparing for a evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon was making preparations for himself.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael, he's still pissed off at gob... and he went looking for a family expert to create trouble.
i know you dated shannon.
with that cheerleader?
yeah, she's probably gonna take him to one of those stupid different
i wish i had someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and asked him... but he was breathing and he dropped the phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe we should both go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hello.
my mother took him.
he's making me record him to school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the george michael situation with mrs. bearly.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morals...
you see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's like, she's in love with you, so
she knows we're dating.
i told her you were sleeping with my brother.
this could be the most unethical thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been a junior in half a semester
look, that was preemptive.
my brother was gonna try to sleep with you.
then i want to leave you right now and i won't come back.
i see.
from now on.
george sr. went for a walk with cindi.
george.
and she started to know him.
you could totally pour me out here.
he weighs weight on my
you, you...
she's picking up the camera
i'm taking her to the nannong dance, this is your dinner, so she's away with my mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy
watch your back, my immigration little brother!
and the spring dance was in the final temple.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting her in because she doesn't have a strong square jaw with your perfectly-shaped nose, your circle-shaped eyes.
you wanna dance?
all right!
finally found shannon, gob called...
gobun found out he was cheating on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i ruined our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about it for a long time, and-and
that's... you mean the right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing at a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yes, with my ethics teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
i'm really touched that you're trying to protect me after i treat you so badly.
in fact, gob confuses michael's ethics teacher... with civics teacher.
man, he's got... the type.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a civics teacher.
second movement.
i was talking to mrs. baerly, and i should never have brought gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never wanted to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed at some sad things, but...
i don't think we're gonna have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm getting that cake.
hey, you wanna dance?
i can't believe this is working.
on the next arrested development.
buster's conflict gets hot.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
no candles allowed here.
my mom would freak.
no, it's okay.
i'm lighting my own candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you with these?
it's ok
right here, i'll help you.
these, too?
okay, here, let me carry it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're proposing, connie, is really extreme.
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die
we're all going one day, right?
four months ago, each of you attended a interview to attend an never-fired tv show.
and guess what?
you won.
i guess some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm a total gay man and i'm proud of
you're sweet, aren't you
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel, from england.
me too.
he's my brother stanton, my probation officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him in the head.
he doesn't know
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they say barack obama these days.
each of you is gonna earn $00,000, all you have to do is spend one night in this prison.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
damn you!
cool.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know if this is a prank?
right.
it's our third show, but we're not gonna publish until the fall.
to find out if this is a prank, you'll have to play and earn the money.
you will be asked to perform a series of tasks.
the mission will force your limit, your courage and your thought.
sounds like fun, doesn't it?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i didn't have a girlfriend to admit it even when she was
i need to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
go around.
you'll notice.
the total amount of money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if you all make it through the night, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can spend the night here.
anybody else wanna join him?
i'm not.
i can't possibly go all the way to the city with this
i'm in
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him
bye.
you're stupid.
it's a fucking party joke, you're all gonna be screwed.
you're nothing but a bunch of idiots.
can't you see this is a record party?
or we'll be famous.
there's a human head there!
don't worry, it's not
looks pretty real to me.
that's why they call it special effects.
lovely, isn't it
a little sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thanks to our award-winning special effects team.
follow me, fellas.
in the warm swamp water, lazy crocodiles are waiting for their prey.
the indian crocodiles are long and benignous.
such crocodiles...
guys.
i see you're working hard as usual.
are we ready?
we're all set
and absolutely.
keep this up.
yes, sir.
hi.
great job to scare them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are going to show up.
you seemed really scared.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, when this place really looks at me, it
did you know that?
the dead homeless?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
must be a big coincidence.
do you think it's really safe there?
it's safe enough for the show to be insured.
any other questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're filming.
each of you was chosen by your own free will to spend the night in prison to earn $00,000 each.
isn't it clear enough?
okay, let the party begin.
you can find everything you need in your base camp, that's the principal's office.
where?
it's compl
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you've taken all of our possessions, how can we write?
go down the hall, turn right, right again, left.
straight up the stairs, left, right, and one more left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
you'll find a key to get rid of your chains there.
is anyone in there?
we'll see.
i thought leaving the basement was horrible.
have fun, inmates.
good luck.
where is she going?
welcome to the mission.
can you please not do that?
i don't see shit here.
does anyone remember where we're going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, two rights, then a left.
there were too many straight walks.
no, go straight down the hall, down the hall,
" turn right, turn right again, and left.
"then straight up to the stairs, then straight up,
"sola, right, and left again."
what are you?
smart.
illet, it's gonna be a great

it was fun.
let's speed them up a little

damn it.
i don't
the power's running low, the generator had to step in.
damn it!

strange, isn't it?
be careful!

look, key.
yeah.
okay.

i think it's the manager
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what's up, man?
"hi, brave contestants.
"welcome to warden clem harvis's office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room
"this chess piece will determine your personal role.
"you cannot trade with other contestants.
"the razor blades were her favorite".
"now it's your turn to put your hand in the box."
shit.
so, who wants first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't
what do you mean you don't know
i mean, i don't
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black fort.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
damn you!
that was really sick.
my little piggies, welcome to the mission.
now let me tell you about the pennyville state prison.
in the time of crisis in 0000, when the cost went up, the ruthless warden decided to raise his fortune by eliminating certain expenses.
they were prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the director was released.
the last person here on death row was warden harvis himself.
rumor has it that the warden was still walking down the halls.
tonight, you will be asked to face the warden and the tortured souls in this building.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
does anyone want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the prison chapel to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first hallway.
sounds great.
thank you.
damn it!
what happened?
they shut off my flashlight.
i can't see anything.
okay, calm down, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung babies!
their children... their
i think they've got it covered with speakers.
sounds are more effective than images to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
god!
that sounds lovely.
no, i'm fine, man.
nutcase.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't
there's a sound
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're using speakers, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flashlight.
okay, now?
open the bible to the marked page...
"where you will find the lord's prayer.
"there was no disrespect in this place 00 years ago, 00 years ago
"now this is the room of unusual events."
oh, my... "in reverse."
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit
i can't do
"when you've completed your mission...
"if there's no sign of the warden,
you can go back to camp.
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry about who i'm bothering.
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
"to protect us from evil...
"our father who art in heaven...
"do not let evil lead us.
"to keep us from crossing...
"forgive us our debts as we forgive those who owe us.
"give us our daily bread today.
"as it is in heaven...
"as in the sky,
"for thy will be thy kingdom and domination."
please tell me i can go now.
"before you go to camp"
jesus, randall, you have to blow out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look what they're made for money
where'd she go?
i understand the people who did this work cut our connection to our homo friend for a while to create a more terrifying weather.
whatever.
absolutely, it's gone nice and
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, dude, it's not that bad.
it's definitely not worth the
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it
they can give you another assignment.
don't joke
i swear you don't even know how you feel there.
it's like walking through a thick fog, just cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
yeah, she's right.
i want to take the next one.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated
let's get scelzi down and have a look, you can fix it.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy
either we talk or i go or i talk or
it's important to me too, taylor
what do you mean?
i had a little research done.
you mean the local girl you used to sleep with?
am i right?
big lips, large hips, taylor.
okay, so prison wasn't just for men
is there a department of women?
and that damn crazy manager would go naked around the women's department and he wouldn't answer anyone.
he beat them, raped them, knocked them down, and starved them to death.
they say he made some of them eat their own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this true story will increase interest in the show!
everyone could be talking about us.
that's nothing compared to the fact that you invented that story.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do that, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
yeah?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they are.
good.
scelzi, what is that?
just a little something to get me through the night.
you want some?
get your hairy ass here right now, okay?
yes, captain.
hello?
you scared the hell out of me.
i've got some pretty good stuff
suit yourself.
we're all ready to begin.
i'd say my biggest fear is being buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will lead you to freedom. "
okay,
i'm at the end of freedom.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
damn you!
what?
blood.
it's not real
no cursing, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me you're upstairs, not down.
i'm sorry
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down, you'll see a door with a finger
he says...
damn it!
"welcome to cell number five.
" considering the violent and insanity of insanity,
shit.
tell me what to do and i'll get out of this hell right now.
no!
thank you.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a prisoner fails to commit suicide, if he fail
"you will now live a sentence for a prisoner".
okay, where's the
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult mission.
"once you're about to be told what to do when
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my duty.
connie.
what?
look at this.
what?
it can't
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back, and i specifically told you, you added something to the show, and you're asking why you were fired?
this is not our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't
don't look at me.
look, connie, you have to get that guy out, okay?
he's gonna screw
damn it!
we'll be ruined.
so you didn't bring this?
no cuts.
it's obvious
what's so obvious?
come closer.
i asked you why you were putting cameras in the control room.
yeah.
the back-stage footage... they want to record...
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
genius, isn't it
it's absolutely br
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to record how they frighten us by putting something into the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you could do another mission.
smartass.
okay, black king and white horse turn right and go to the gas chamber.
the white queen and black knight are straight ahead, and they're going to prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"and then turn left at once to the right.
"tale and go to the end of the hallway,
"and come down the stairs".
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, open it.
we're in.
"welcome to the gathering room.
there must be a light on the wall behind you, open it.
"black king and white knight enter the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
it deserved the best there, it was a real place.
the only place the legal department cleans.
nice, isn't
pretty creepy.
oh, my god
what is that smell?
a documented true death chamber is often carried by its own smell of death.
of course, the smell is not death.
if a man knows his last moments of life, his worry is finally up to the final point, it'll cause him plenty of stinking materials.
in that case, the smell of the human smell we're breathing and the gas that killed him.
it's time for fun, ladies and
the black man sits in the witness box.
black king?
that would be me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you will find some meat and a pan.
"you're gonna cook this meat and eat
man!
the inmates are always eating nerds, pigs...
"or there is no lamb and there is no lamb...
"they suspected what happened.
"they thought it was a lovely past that they've never tasted before".
you're talking about human flesh, aren't you
are you in there?
yeah.
guess what you'll do now?
i gave up.
you'll tie toni up.
i'm transferring you from here, toni should fully comprehend the fear of the prisoners before they were given gas.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends had strange wishes.
are you okay?
okay.
"your duty... your gass teammate...
"before it kills the main valve and cut the gas."
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to throw up.
okay.
strange.
i can't do
i can't
this is my worst nightmare ever.
come on, honey, it's just the show.
"no more prank."
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they'll pay extra money."
do it for the team, girl.
are you gonna puke?
thank you.
okay, angel, i'm at the bottom of the stairs.
damn it!
can you hear me?
he's back
it really stinks.
let me out.
come on.
