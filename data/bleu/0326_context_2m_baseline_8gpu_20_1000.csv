michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, the person he shared his bed was his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss mom.
i will.
i need to write an essay on at least 000 words... about the morality of a war and a conflict.
i'm not sure our ethics teacher would appreciate me cheating while trying.
so, you passed my moral test.
actually, gorgeemichael had desperately burned his brother... desperately, to his teacher, bethbly.
small crimes... people with small crimes... can barely cut their hands.
no ring ring ring ring ring no ring ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
you need to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
g.d.k.'s eye was on us.
your father thought it would make us look even better.
he must have faked my signature.
'maybe a year ago i'll have a son who's finished his sweat cheese!
you gotta get me out of this.
i'll call the social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't look at him either.
i don't have a mother's kindness and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
they're a couple of fun girls... a couple of fun
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm offering you an olive branch here.
yes-yes.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
meanwhile, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
why do i tell you this?
i guess it's because there's some things you can't tell your father.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to arrange his teacher for his mother's duties to his father.
there's nothing wrong with that.
but i have to explain to you that i'm a little hurt because you don't think about it.
and aunts can do that.
and the teachers can do that job.
surely, one day, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay had never been so proud of what she said all her life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i was telling you about.
girl, really... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma," you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the moustache.
yeah.
but gob michael's courtesy misunderstood his emotional attraction... and felt he was competing to get involved.
because, you know, beyond love... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
_
and george sr. was about to get a surprise visit.
i've read all your teachings and got all your tapes.
and i watched it all again.
george sr. had recently released a series of cassettes... which he'd given to people... to make money for the spirituality of his new discovery.
i also lost two pounds at the same time eating your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to find out.
this is a good place to start.
and michael met lindsay at parent-teacher night after two girls who were dating.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this rape room have the same gun plan as our kitchen?
i think he's really good for you.
i'd think that'd make her think it was a mother thing.
besides, i can't hurry up and get married just because my son wants to.
i'm miss baerly, the ethics teacher.
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life... that could be destroyed by a reckless tether.
and michael started getting to know his son's ethics teacher.
that's the "rrr" part.
you know, it's annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels' stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you laughed.
"rrr!" - "rrr!"
but, you know, ... ... . ....
and i think i'm a moral man.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite you for a drink?
or... or... or... or... or
yeah, he's dead.
well, i think that mr. daniels' paralysis incident... is...
let's go get a drink.
well, maybe it'll help.
george sr. was working on his own fan.
i've already told you a lot of my sins.
maybe you can tell me a few sins.
well, there's a legal display of my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me about one of the things that happened... once again at the college dorm.
and what does michael have to do with his meeting with miss bayerly, who's got a second date today... and, uh,
michael, this little korean, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it's him.
to be precise, you have to rob her to the underwear.
yes, mother.
they'll take her back.
don't take off your shoes, little gentleman!
don't take off your shoes!
it's out of control.
who is it?
this "momong," your father and i were adopted.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille found out that buster was worried, even jealous.
and he figured out what it feels like to be ignored.
annyong's your brother's your sister's your sister
abort.
he's staying.
listen, i'll call you sonar again.
nice ride.
you're making dinner reservations?
he did a little korean.
and after the meeting... and after the dates...
michael took a step that he hasn't thrown in years.
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how are we gonna leak in without waking everybody up?
this may not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i love from you.
so i took someone you love.
i'm "nashbaggerlajam"...."
listen, i know you're trying to get back at me for the whole marta thing.
i was lying to you when i said i wasn't gonna try to sleep him, so...
he has to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i'm really lucky i got rid of him.
no problem.
so romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i gotta tell you i don't know if it's real.
but now, your... moral teacher... now... is... your teacher...
yeah, i did that for her.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm sure you're interested in him, you know.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
about his class?
i mean, that he loves her saddam... that he loves her...
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with him.
well, why would he do that?
why did morality sleep with my teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new... new...
he's not one of the good shooters who targeted him, and he's about to shoot everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was... his...
i mean, you don't think he's old enough for you, do you?
we don't even know how old he is.
nobody knows.
she was escorting young girls from different dances... and i thought i'd go over to her and do something...
hey, you wanna dance?"
and i thought, "what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it differently across the mirror, but...
but, you know, um, we've been dancing with jokes or doing something else.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should go out with someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've analyzed a hard book to find a picture of the saddam disappointment in the bathroom suite.
"what would tradam do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's just like our fire exit.
in prison, george sr was preparing to spend the evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon made his preparations.
how are we doing?
we got a video.
and george michael, while he's still angry at gob, he's called the family specialist to create problems.
i know you're dating shannon.
that cheerleader?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different dancers.
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and i asked him... but he was breathing and he dropped his phone.
i haven't heard back.
you know, maybe we should both go.
right, i mean, he was a bad influence...
hi.
mom took it.
do's making me record her at school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the situation between mrs. bearly and george michael.
sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're attracted to her.
i want to talk to you about it.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality... about morality...
you see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, he's like you, he's in love, so...
he knows we're dating.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most unethical thing i've ever heard in my life.
well, you've only been a moral teacher for half a year.
look, it was a preemptive move.
my brother was gonna try and sleep with you.
well, i want to leave you right now and i'm not going back to you.
i see.
starting now.
george sr. went for a walk with cindi.
george.
and she's getting to know him.
you can pour it all to me in here completely.
it weighs on my soul.
you...
he's grabbing the camera.
i'm taking you to the grandmother dance, this is your dinner, so it's away with mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong man.
watch your back, my little immigration brother!
and the different spring dances were at the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting him in because he doesn't have a strong square jaw in his flesh-shaped eyes, like you.
do you want to dance?
all right!
gob finally found shannon he was looking for...
gobun found out he was cheating on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
sorry.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i screwed up, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about this for a long time, and-and... and... and...
that's... that's what you mean by the right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, with my moral teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my moral teacher.
after you've been so mean to you, i'm really moved by you trying to protect me.
in fact, gob mistook michael's ethics teacher with the domestic information teacher.
man, he's... he's got it.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a domestic teacher.
act two.
i was seeing miss baerly, and i shouldn't have brought gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked him, i didn't know what else to do.
i never wanted to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed at some sad things, but...
i don't think we're gonna have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm taking this cake.
hey, you wanna dance?
i can't believe this is working.
he's on the next arrested development.
buster's piss is fried.
stop, stop, stop, stop!
no candles allowed here.
my mom's going crazy.
no, it's okay.
i'm lighting my own candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
no problem.
right here, let me help you.
these?
okay, here, let me carry it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is something really extreme.
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
ok!
ok!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we'll all go one day, won't we?
four months ago, each of you joined an interview to join a tv show that has never been done.
and guess what?
you win.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm totally gay, and i'm proud of it.
you're cute, aren't you?
i want to lead our country.
next question.
my name is angel, from england.
me too.
that's my brother stanton, my probation officer.
hi.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him in the head.
he doesn't know.
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they look like barack obama these days.
each one of you is gonna make $00,000.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
fuck!
great.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know if this is a prank?
right.
actually, this is our third show, but we're not gonna do it until the fall.
to see if it's a prank, you're gonna have to play and earn the money.
you'll be asked to perform a series of missions.
the missions will force your borders, your courage and your thinking.
that sounds fun, doesn't it?
what kind of assignment are these, man?
make up your mind now.
i'm in.
where am i signing?
i didn't even have a girlfriend to admit it when she was high.
i need to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some people died there.
like what?
go around.
you'll notice.
the total amount of money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if you all take the night off, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can make me spend the night here.
anyone else want to join him?
not me.
there's no way i'm going to town with this pissed-boy to the city
i'm in.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you're stupid.
it's a fucking party joke, you're all gonna get high.
you don't look anything but a bunch of idiots.
can't you see it's a party on this record?
or we'll be famous.
there's a human head in there!
don't worry, it's not real.
it seemed pretty real to me.
that's why they call it "special effects."
lovely, isn't it?
a little sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thank you for our rewarding special effects team.
follow me, fellas.
they're in hot swamp, waiting for lazy crocodiles.
the indian crocodiles are tall and slimy-faced.
to these crocodiles...
guys.
i see you work hard as usual.
ready?
we're all set.
and exactly.
keep it up.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great to scare them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are gonna join the show.
you really looked like you'd been compromised.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really gives me the creeps when i look at it.
did you know that?
the homeless who died?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
it must be a big coincidence.
do you really think it's safe there?
safe enough for the show to be insured.
any other questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're rolling.
each one of you has been selected by your own free will to spend the night in jail for $00,000 a head.
clear enough, isn't it?
all right, let's get the party started.
you can find everything you need at your base camp, that's the principal's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you took all of us, how can we write it down?
go down the aisle, turn right, right, right, then left.
straight to the stairs, left, right, and another left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
you'll find a key to get rid of your chains there.
is there anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought it was horrible to leave the basement.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to the mission.
can't you just not do that?
i can't see a damn thing in here.
does anyone remember where we're going?
straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, two right, then left.
it was too flat.
no, go straight down the hall, down the hall, down the hall, down the
"turn around, make it right again, and left.
"then straight as the stairs, upstairs,
"sola, right, and left again".
what are you?
smart.
illet will be a great show.
careful.
careful.
god.
what is this place?
and get ready.
that was fun.
let's give them some speed.
okay, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
the power's running out, the generator should have come in already.
shit!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's freezing.
look, key.
yeah.
okay.
look, people.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who's that?
i think it's the warden.
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what, man?
"hi, brave contestants.
"welcome to warden clem harvis.
"there's a box in the middle of the room.
"this chess piece will determine your personal role.
"you cannot change your balls with other contestants.
"the rags were his favorite".
"now it's your turn to put your hand in the box."
shit.
well, who wants to go first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black rook.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
fuck!
that was really crazy.
my little piggies, welcome to the mission.
now, let me tell you about pennyville state prison.
in the time of crisis in 0000, when the cost went up, the brutal warden thought he'd raise his fortune by destroying some desperate expenses.
they were prisoners!
by the time the warden's crimes were released, 00 prisoners were already executed.
the last person to be sentenced to death here was director harvis himself.
rumor has it that the manager was still out here in the halls.
you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured souls under this building tonight.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
anybody want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the prison church to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first hallway.
it's a great sound job.
thank you.
shit!
what happened?
they've turned off my flashlight.
i can't see anything.
okay, relax, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung babies!
children... children of their children... children...
i think it's all covered with speakerphone.
voices are more effective than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
god!
that sounds great.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
something came up.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're using speakerphone, randall.
really.
okay.
oh...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flashlight.
okay now?
open the marked page from the bible...
"there you will find god's prayers.
"in 00 years ago, the sacred place was disrespectful to this place,
"now, this is a room for extraordinary events."
oh, my... the opposite.
impossible.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do that.
"when you complete your mission...
"if there's no sign of the director,
you can go back to camp.
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry about who i'm bothering.
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
"prot us from evil... protect us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"don't let evil control us.
"protection us from overstepping...
"as we forgive those who owe us, forgive us our debts.
"give us our daily bread today.
"as in heaven...
"like the sky,
"because kingdom and rule are yours."
please tell me i can go now.
"before going camping."
jesus, randall, you have to put out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look what they do for money.
where'd he go?
i understand that the people who did this job have cut our contact with our homo friend for a while, trying to make it a more creepy weather.
whatever.
it's definitely gone in a groove.
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
have you seen anyone?
no.
come on, man, it's not that bad.
definitely not worth the money.
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it again.
they can assign you again.
don't joke.
i swear, you don't even know how you feel there.
it's like you're walking in a busy fog, just cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you expect me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complex.
let's get scelzi to go downstairs and check it out.
scelzi.
yeah.
you gotta go downstairs and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
either we talk or i'll go.
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i did a little research.
are you talking about the town girl you're sleeping with?
am i right?
big lips, broad hips, taylor.
okay, prison wasn't just for men, was it?
there's a women's department?
and the damn crazy warden wandered around the part of the women's department, he didn't answer to anyone.
he beat them, raped them, pregnant, and starved them to death.
it's said that some people feed their own babies.
what do you mean?
what do i mean?
this real story will increase the attention of the show!
anyone could be talking about us.
that's nothing compared to the fact that you're making this story up.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do that, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
yeah?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yeah, they do.
good.
scelzi, what's that?
it's just a little something that makes me take the night off.
you want some?
get your hairy ass over here, okay?
aye, aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the shit out of me.
i got a great stuff in my hand.
suit yourself.
we're all ready to start.
i'd say my biggest fear is to be buried alive.
where am i going now?
"here's gonna set you free."
okay, okay, okay
i'm at the end of liberty.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
fuck!
what?
blood.
it's not real blood.
no curse, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs aren't down, you're up.
sorry.
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down, you're gonna see a finger door.
he says... he's... he's
shit!
"welcome to prison number five, please.
" considering the violent and insanity and insanity,
shit.
tell me what to do... and i'll get the hell out of here.
no!
thank you.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a convict can't kill himself, if he doesn't, he can't,
"now you'll be punished for a prisoner."
okay, where's the hole?
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult task.
"what will you do when you get in the hole?"
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my mission.
connie.
what?
check this out.
what?
no... no... no... no... no
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back, and i specifically told you... that the show added something, and you still want to know why you were fired?
this isn't our guy.
where'd he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you gotta get that guy out, okay?
he's gonna screw up the show.
shit!
we'll be screwed.
you didn't bring this up there?
not with cuts.
it's obvious.
what's open?
come closer.
i asked you why you were putting a camera in the control room.
yeah.
behind the camera footage... what they wanted to record... the footage... the footage... the
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
genius, isn't it?
absolutely brilliant.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to record how you scared us by putting something on the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black king and white horse.
duty four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you could be on duty again.
smartass.
okay, black king and white horse turning right and heading to the gas chamber.
the white queen and the black horse are running straight, and they're going to the prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"man and horse go left and turn right.
"tro and the horse go to the end of the hall,
"and go down the stairs".
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, open it.
we're in.
"welcome to the packing room.
there must be a light in the wall behind you, turn it on.
"black king and white horse are entering the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
it deserves the best, it's the whole place.
it's the only place the legal department has cleaned up.
good, isn't it?
pretty creepy.
god.
what's that smell?
a documented fact of execution rooms often carry the smell of death itself.
of course it's not the smell of death.
if a man knows his life is coming to the end of his life, his concern is that he has plenty of stinking.
in that case, what we're worried about is the smell of human smell and the gas that killed him.
it's fun time, ladies and gentlemen.
the black hawk is sitting in the chair.
black king?
this is me.
wait for further instructions.
"there's some meat and you're gonna find a chicken.
you'll cook this meat and eat it.
man!
the inmates always eat meat, pork, pig...
"or because there's no lamb, and there's another meat...
"they suspected it was happening.
"they thought it was a nice meat they never tasted before."
you're talking about human flesh, aren't you?
are you in there?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i gave up.
you're gonna tie toni.
