michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, he was his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss mom.
i'll tell him
i need to write at least 000 words about the moral side of the war and the ability of a conflict.
i'm not sure the ethics teacher would like me to cheat while writing a test.
so, you passed my moral test.
in fact, he was desperate for his teacher, who was in the genuine lethbai betaerlyad.
even the criminals who commit minor crimes can be disabled.
no ring no ring
try to remember everything he said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
you have to do something about my son.
and you, my father, adopted?
the fg.d.k.' s eye was on us.
your father thought it would make us look more charitable.
he must have imitated my signature.
i'll have a son who's finished his cottage cheese.
you've got to get me out of
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't take care of him
i no longer have a mother's compassion and milk.
hello.
michael.
there's two girls here.
a couple of fun girls... couple of
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yeah, yeah.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
meanwhile, lindsay was doing his homework with george michael.
why do i tell you this?
i guess it's because there's some things you can't
lindsay thought george michael was trying to set up his teacher... to help him fulfil his maternal mission.
there's nothing wrong with that.
but i must express to you that i'm a little hurt that you haven't thought of me about it.
the aunts can carry out the mission.
the teachers can do that.
one day, you will find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay was never so proud of her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i keep telling you about.
she's really... the young girl.
your date, nazh... your date, your
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma, you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache
yeah.
but gob mistook michael's kindness for sentimental attention... and felt he was competitive to interfere.
because, you know, beyond adorable love... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
[ nazhgalia, michael, shannon ] really?
and george sr. was about to have a surprise visit.
i've read all your teachings and bought all your tapes.
and i watched it all again.
[ narrator ] george sr. had recently marketed a series of tapes... that he has recently offered to gain money from his new spirituality.
i also lost two kilos eating your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to find out where
this is a good place to start.
and michael got out of the two girls he had a date with, and he met lindsay at parent-teacher night.
hey, linds, is this my imaginary product... or does this monk room have the same floor plan with our kitchen floor?
i think he's very good for you.
i thought it would make her think of her maternal concept.
besides, i can't rush a job like this just because my son wants me to and marry someone.
i'm mrs. baerly, the ethics
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life... so that they can't be thoughtless with a pull of a trigger.
and michael became familiar with his son's ethics teacher.
that's what this is about.
you know, it's very frustrating
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you laugh.
"rrrr.!
but, you know, but, you know,
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent-teacher invite a drink?
or... or...
yeah, he's dead
i think it's because of this mr. daniels paralysis disaster of mr. daniels,
let's go get a drink.
yeah, maybe it'll help
george sr. was dealing with his own admirer.
i've already told you many of my sins.
maybe you could tell me some of your sins.
well, there are legal demonstrations that show my sins.
but, back to your sins.
tell me about one of those things... and one of them at the college dorm again.
and what's the deal with mrs. bayerly, the second date today... today... is...
michael, this little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it's him.
you have to peel him to the pants to tell me for sure.
yes, mom.
they'll take him back.
don't take your shoes off, little mister!
don't take your shoes off!
it's out of
who's that
this is "annyong, your father and i have adopted.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille realized that buster was concerned, even jealousy.
and he knew what it was like to be ignored.
now annyong is your brother now your sister
cancel it.
he's stay
listen, i'll call you back.
it was a nice
you having dinner reservations?
he's made a "ufak korean.
and after their meeting......
michael's had a step he hasn't
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a great idea.
but how are we going to sneak in without waking everyone up
this may not be the best idea i've ever had.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i loved from you.
i got someone you love.
i'm the "nashbashbaglajam'd
listen, i know you're trying to get revenge on marta.
i was lying to you when i said i wasn't gonna try to sleep with her, so...
he has to accept that.
i don't think there's gonna be a problem
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i really had the chance to get rid of it.
it's ok
it's so
who's "n betn-ahdenin?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i must say i don't know if it's real.
but now... your morale teacher... is now... your
yeah, i did it for her.
oh.
he likes saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm pretty sure you're interested in her... by the point of
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
is it about his class?
i mean, she loves him... the way he lov
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with her.
well, why would he do that?
why did he sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new... new... new...
he's not one of the good shotguns, and he'll shoot anywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think she's old?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
she used to accompany young girls in different dances... and i thought about going to her place with a prank... and, uh, i thought
"celalam, do you want to dance or something
and that's something, i thought you're gonna, " what's gonna happen, okay
i did it different in front of the mirror, but
but, you know, uh, we're dancing mixed with jokes or doing something else.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should date someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've applied a book that's hard to find a picture of saddam's shower suite.
" what would he do? "
yeah.
yeah, you know anything?
okay, that's the same way our fire escape came out.
in prison, george sr. was preparing for the evening with his most loyal fan.
when cindi lightballoon made his own preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael, while he's still mad at gob... he's gone looking for a family expert to cause trouble.
i know you're dating shannon.
with that cheerleader?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different
i wish i could get someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels, and i asked him... but he breathed and dropped the phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe we should both go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example... an evil example...
hello.
mom took it.
he's making me sign it to school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the george michael situation with mrs. bearly.
i'm sorry.
hey.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality... if you
see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, he's like, he's in love with you, so
he knows we're out.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most unethical thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been teaching ethics for half a sem
look, it was a preliminary move.
my brother was gonna try to sleep with you.
so, i want to leave you at this exact moment, and i'm not coming back to you.
i understand.
from now on.
he went for a walk with george sr. cindi.
george.
and he's getting to know her
you can totally pour me in here.
it's weighing weight
you, you,
he's grabbing the camera
i'm taking your dinner, this is your dinner, away with mom.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby to a place.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy
watch your back, my little brother immigrants!
and the different spring dance was in the final theme.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting him in because he's not just his perfectly good-looking, flat-shaped eyes, strong square jaw.
you wanna dance?
all right!
so gob finally found the shannon he was looking for
gobun found out he cheated on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i messed up, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about it for, and-and-and-
that's... you mean the right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, with my moral teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
after being so bad to you, i'm really overheard of you trying to protect me.
in fact, gob mistooked michael's ethics teacher with a local citizenship teacher.
man, he... he understands the type.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a public defender teacher.
second act.
i was seeing miss baerly, and i should never have involved gob.
but the day you told me you liked him, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with the kids
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed at some very sad things, but... but... but...
i don't think we have a future together.
and, jeremy, i'm taking this cupcake.
hey, you want to dance?
i can't believe this is working.
he's in the next arrested development.
buster's pickup would be nasty.
stop, stop, stop, stop!
no candles are allowed here.
mom would go crazy.
no, it's okay.
i'm lighting my own candle.
yeah, that's what i'm gonna do
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
it's ok
right here, let me help you.
these too?
okay, i'll move it for you.

this abandoned prison.
wow!

how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know if this is a prank?
right.
this is our third show, but we're not gonna publish it until the fall.
you're gonna have to play the game and earn the money to find out if this is a prank.
you will be asked to carry out a series of missions.
the missions will force your borders, your courage and your thoughts.
that sounds like fun, doesn't it?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make your decision now.

i didn't have a girlfriend to admit it even when she was
i need to keep an eye on my little brother

some people died there.
like what?
move around.
you'll find out.
the total money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if you all make it through the night, there's a rich prize.
no money could get me to spend the night here.
anyone else want to join him?
i'm not.
there's no way i'm going all the way to the

welcome, my little pigs, the mission.
now, let me tell you about pennyville state prison.
in the time of the crisis in 0000, when the costs were bigger, the ruthless director thought of destroying a few expenses.
they were prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed before the director was exposed.
the last person here was sentenced to death row, he was principal harvis himself.
rumor has it that the manager was still walking around the halls.
tonight you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured souls under this building.

they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, take it easy, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung the babies!
their children... children
i think they've got it covered with speakerphones.
the voices are more effective than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
god!
that sounds great.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy guy.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't
something came up.

i think we've done something really great.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.

i don't think i can do it
they can assign you back.
no kidding.
i swear you don't even know how people feel in there.

big lips, large hips, taylor.
okay, prison isn't just for men?
is there a women's department?
and that fucking wacky warden wandered around the women's department, never answered anyone.
he beat them, raped them, knocked them up, and then starved them to death.
some say he feed his own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this real story's gonna interest you!
anyone could be talking to us.
this story you're making is nothing compared to the truth.
i think so.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do that, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
is that so?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yeah, they're working.

yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i gave up.
you'll tie toni up.
i'm transferring you from here, toni should fully fear the fears of the prisoners before the gas was given immediately.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends had weird demands.
are you okay?
okay.
" your mission of the gas teammate... "
" to find the main vane and cut the gas before it does. "
you need to watch the pipes.
it makes sense.

because in new york, in washington, in london, you didn't want that.
but the kids of pakistan didn't want it either

qasim is offering a new kind of threat.
so far, he hasn't targeted civil
our models show the possibility of an attack within 00 hours.
the more pressure he gets under, the smaller the window.
i can't say that when i'm under the tape

if this isn't true anymore, we're already
the americans think we don't serve purpose anymore.
we need a head.
i'll be relieved of duty
you heard nothing about qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, what's gonna happen to me
you take it off.
nobody else knows you're inside qasim's network
just get out of here.
will holloway?
go.
how's life after mi0?
you're not from the moscow department.
london needs you.
is there anyone you should say goodbye?
thank you.

harry's too arrogant to kill himself.
he was just trying to kill himself.
he went to this woman's grave

harry's team has noticed a change in harry's attitude since she died.
he's emotionally cold, cold, started drinking a high amount of alcohol

why did he call you?
i have no idea.
the last time i spoke to him was from mi0 officer three years ago.
he wants to talk right now.
that makes you useful.
can you help us find him?
no, thanks.
and harry, do you talk much about berlin?
the night your father died?
if there's anything else, mace, i have a right to know.
i don't think i'm gonna be able to decide
if you weren't really gonna kill him, i think you told me what you wanted
find harry so you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
i thought i was gonna take that title to the grave.
recently, the president of the anti-terrorist for his majesty's security service.
funny, but who are you really?
someone who knows what these two words mean to you.
asma shishani.
go.
how'd you find me?
what do you want?
i know someone did it on my side.
they never told me who they were.
of course they didn't, but you must have a connection.
it's a phone number, that's

in return, i'll give you what you want.

i don't need guarantees.

you put him in danger and now you refuse to save him from pain?
how the fuck are you?
don't send the video to his parents.
harry... harry
you have a deal.
according to the bbc, there's no progress in the capture of the escaped terrorist adem qasim.
the national threat level has been on critical level, so there's an attack on the hand.
in the economy news, ftse 000 fell again this morning, sterling, the dollar, the euros and other funds continued to fade.
there's a new intel on harry.
he received a preliminary mistake from the city coast.
holloway, this is confidential information.
we also found explosive tracks there.
you've known him longer than any of us.
do you think it's possible qasim could get harry involved somehow?
pull her with him?
i don't
anyway, you find harry, we're qasim.
anything for holloway?
here you go.
tomorrow, 00.
salpa 0, show a, put it on 0 : 00.

i hope you come alone.

what am i doing here, harry?
i had to find someone i could trust outside the service.
it's a short list when you're drunk and dead.
to be honest, the only person i can say friend is someone who thinks i ruined his life.
qasim's escape was arranged by someone at the top of the service.
by someone who wants you to follow me.
that's why i had to get lost.
you had qasim.
he's our only connection to the traitor
when he's in the system, he'll be
he's planning an attack.
someone's trying to destroy the service itself.
you're nuts.

look, that's all i want.
what are you waiting for, harry?
mi0 was all i had and you took it from me, for nothing.
hate me all you want, but i think you believe in the service.
what happened in berlin?
did they fool you like that?
this may not be the end of it, just the way you
i'm afraid i have to tell them something's on the lining of your jacket

i'll send you a number.
call me in 00 hours, please.
i'm a security guard.
put your hands behind your back!
you just let her go.
easy, francis.
we don't want you to have a heart
the deadly one.
mi0 looks like a complete liability right now, and i'm the last friend in the government of mi0.
so you have to be really nice to me right now.
in other words, is he crazy?
that's not contradicting his last three psych eval
he refused to attend.
he didn't stop being harry pearce.
no matter how crazy it is, i'm gonna get him...

she asked me to help her disappear.
didn't it occur to you to accept her request and bring her to us?
just because your life hasn't been shitting since harry kicked you out, don't think we can't make it any more shitty.
since we've threatened each other, the three of you haven't been flushed off a cliff or anything.
your entire organization seems to be disabled now.

it's completely
they're ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i saw that name in a case.
i thought they took you off duty.
they took it
now, what really happened?
the abduction could have been arranged by someone in the service.
you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i left it 0 weeks ago.
there must be one around here.
tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't apply
when i was 00, i was hanging out with a kid who made the cash transfers.
k department was interested in some people using it, so they got to me.
you started as an agent?
and when i was done, they asked me to train as an officer.
my parents came back to me when i told them.
and if someone you work with helped qasim get away, that would be a problem, wouldn't it?
all right.
something felt wrong that day.
rob vass, my team leader, was in the lead car with me.
he told me not to open the weapons compartment.
he ordered me not to.
where does he live?

who are you?

when i went for my gun, you said not to fire me.
we made a vow, rob.
i'm not saying anything until i get to thames house.
we're not going to thames house thames
will, what have you got?
qasim's guards were deliberately weakened.
the team leader was involved.
he's just an err

i never felt compelled to say this before, but i hope you know what you're doing.

he stole an entire gchq data archives.
everything we have on our west agent friends in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
he showed up at the schlepfield airport cctv.

harry didn't do that cyber attack alone.
then who's helping him?
except you.
and you're still protecting her.
why?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i'll find him.
and there's a threat.
according to analysis, within 00 hours, there will be a large-scale attack, multiple targets.
an agent who was on duty at qasim's escape is missing.
he's got signs of a struggle at his
you know anything about that?
how's your mom, holloway?
i heard it wasn't very good.
your father hasn't been able to heal since he died.
that's understandable, really.
and then that doorwork comes in.
i know, i know.
harry was right about one thing.
you're not good enough.
do we really hope the home secretary will stop attacking qasim again?
we have wiped out the threats of our freedom and our way of life.

jesus, will.
preparation is everything.
what about vass?
when he came to my house, i reported
i said someone was asking about qasim's escape.
they hooked me up to the command center, and they told me what to do.
they went to vass's house before us and planted the evidence.
i've arranged for vass to escape.
you think i want to do it?
i know my duty.
i'm the only one here who
you're being played.
he's right, will.
but i wonder if mrs keaton is sure about me.
it was a secure command chain.
what was i supposed to do?
you believe him?
yeah.
i'm sure your men will come and find you, if you still have the benefits.
what do you think they're gonna do to you after this is all over
i did what they asked me to do.
we're changing the deal.
we're taking qasim's wife to london.
tell the exchange to come by yourself or you'll never see his wife again.
let's go get her.
what happened to alexanderplatz?

i think he's made it clear he wasn't
i'm the head of the mi0.
kill me and put the gun down.
otherwise, you're nothing but a dead terrorist.
no one will see you as a hero.
when we're done, you're gonna be a drunk, you're gonna be a cruel, impotent
we'll put some marrakech male whores forward and give them free disneyland tickets to tell them you begged them to piss on you.
we can't remember you very well, can we, adem?
wait, wait, wait, wait.
i pulled the chopper back.
but... but
you fucking coward.
i thought you were fighting a higher standard.
i'm sorry about your wife's death, adam
i know what this can do to you.
is that supposed to stop me?
it's
stop!
why did you bring him here?
i made a choice.
without plan b.
why do you think i kept you out of that room?
people are still dead, harry.
less than the ones to die in the explosions.
how can you choose like that?
it's my job.
auntie, can you come play outside?
hello, geraldine.
in the end, it's about who's telling the biggest lie.
isn't it
if we had the morning, qasim would never have run away.
you gave the air unit an order to reverse all mi0 requests, right?
that's the advantage of being a lonely maniac.
i don't need to prove it
sacrificing his own service so he can be absorbed by a foreign power.
the americans would have made you general manager no doubt.
how many more lives was that promotion worth?
what did you think you did, harry?
the service is dying
but if i'd given up the moment i realized i was on the loser side, my career would be
blow my brains out, find my 00-year-old nephew... and find
i think this came from you.
what's that?
his intestines are crazy over an hour or it's causing unstoppable bleeding.
it's not a trace.
how clever.
i was afraid that would be the answer.
so i took the chance to choose.
it's not the lunch that makes you sick.
i ate beef ribs, too.
tell me you're lying, harry.
please.
tell me you didn't betray your country.
it's been 0 hours already, geraldine
you can spend the last 0 hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd play with your pretty nephew.
i'm thinking about
your text said you were gonna tell me something.
they're spying on ruth's grave.
you can't leave now.
i actually have something you should be.
your father was wearing this the night he died.
the stasi stripped everything that could work out, found a way to get into his body and fsb archives somewhere.
was he wearing a wedding ring on the night of his operation?
i didn't appoint you for not being good enough.
after your father, i couldn't do...
i had to protect you.
good ones never last, will.
who'll drive then?
they're like me
if you know your question and tell the men at the door, it would help.
there's room for every guest at the hotel middle school.
assemble in one row.
these new problems kill in darkness.
they'll be grateful to you when these people get dark.
i think we should keep them here to keep them safe, but i'm worried things are getting worse.
they have no idea who caused the darkness problem.
besides, it's not what's hiding in the dark that we should
we still haven't figured out how to lift that fog wall
maybe it's a blessing.
it was the latest from in-flight-flight pure.
i'm on your side and i might need a new job.
i'm in control, but i'd appreciate another pillow for my beauty sleep.
try to fix things.
we talked about this.
it's almost impossible to destroy someone with a problem without killing him.
of course, i just need data from the tools i don't have and maybe some information i don't have.
i'm gonna need a team
any idea what's going on?
but there's a bad element.
it's the only way to protect the rest of us
it's risky to drive a car because of the magnet
an engineer to help repair the power plant.
he volunteered as soon as he knew about it
if things don't work out, you can use his problem for operator.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
the murderer who didn't leave a trace is out there
and i think he really wants to prove he wants to help you.
okay, so whatever the reason, just keep an eye on her for me, okay?
because neither of us are immune to new problems.
i'm not just saying because it's
i'll call the person who caused the dark trouble at school when you're gone.
he stole those batteries and put us in danger.
there was no other option, dwight.
this is the third time in two weeks.
now the serial killer is in this building.
all right, i'm gonna go talk to dwight.
my dad always said you were a good man.
mara's father?
there may be a way, but if you want me to explain it, it might seem more frightening, so
i can't even find maine on the map.
are you telling me you can't find a town with 00 thousand people?
that's not why things didn'
then why didn't we use aether in the first place to end the problems?
i can't bring it back while the pearls are sealed.
so how do we find it?
gloria brought a box of stuff that duke left at the gull.
i don't think william has the amount of aether i need and aether is just the first step.
you told his wife you'd find her.
it's easy to make a decision from the side, but sometimes things
i have a town to protect.
no wonder the plant works at 00 %.
guys, i'll try, but remember, i've never done anything like this before.
they parked the car here to talk to you, but i don't even have enough money to pay for the oil change.
if all goes well, i'll be back with aether before the sun goes down.
this is peggy's husband, rolf.
enough panic and fear.
the same killer killed my son 00 years ago?
we're calling him the murderer who didn't leave a trace
what else are you hiding from me, vince?
dwight's doing everything he can to make the rules, but he's not the one who's gonna
in this haven, exiled is the same as executing.
thanks to our friend there, we're keeping them in some kind of prison.
he says the generator works at 00 percent.
damn, the generator must have emptied the energy reserves when it overloaded.
well, that would explain the department power to the town.
at this rate, five minutes.
this is about to be over, and this is the only thing that protects us from dying
here, i reconfigured the generator's schemes to get power to the town faster, but there's nothing else we can do.
they better come back.
help each other.
turn around the lamps.
share your supplies.
you see, i'm happy here.
i got your message.
get in the car now.
come on, jump!
if war lies ahead, we should be grateful, even slean.
i don't think you have anything worse than falling in love.
i don't like it here.
every story has two sides.
whoever's behind this is a traitor.
let's go.
he asked me to represent him at slean's wedding.
palace, you are my brother's love.
that's why you're kind of my
you must have seen bigger places in iraqi realms.
none of them were led by a woman, but.
you must choose a second one to escort you and watch your interests during the ritual.
then you will listen to your friends and relatives.
i don't have any rel
my mother and others will accompany you.
kela, this is the palace of bregan.
rheda, must i always have to be guarded?
i don't get it at all.
but i know i have to marry slean.
i'm gonna love her.
this marriage can't happen
abrecan is counting on you.
what do you do?
it's a carpenter
they can use you on the wall, then.
who are you?
he's a friend of the council's
like i said, i have business to attend to.
we need to figure out how to handle it.
varr said i couldn't accept a gift.
that's between us, then.
every bride should smell nice when it's
remember, it's our secret.
sit down.
we're gonna get what we're gonna get when they'
you wanted to talk?
all right.
kela, it's time for your ritual.
elvina, will you be the second person i'm with me?
it's for
we need to talk sometime.
we need to discuss why marriage doesn't work.
if we don't fulfil our mission, their marriage may be
beowulf!
let's celebrate.
according to old customs!
dress smells like something.
i'm so sorry.
it was just a little mistake.
that's all
we're gonna help slean give the symbol to his bride.
that sounds easy.
breca!
open the door!
come on, you stinking mudborn.
come on!
come on!
give me your arm.
come on!
slean.
quiet, she's asleep.
are they ready for this marriage?
i don't understand why slean didn't want to marry kela.
i don't think so.
he's got to put aside his feelings and do what's best for
would you put aside what you wanted for others?
that's what we all have to do.
if someone spends their whole life pleasing others, then that person is not actually living.
it must make you feel pretty free to think like that.
try it.
tell every rock the truth.
only then can you look at each other and light the fire that symbolizes your marriage.
then you'll be husband and wife.
have you ever loved anyone before?
no.
before he came here... you... before he
do you want to be thane?
tell my uncle i'm done with him.
yeah.
come on!
get out of here!
you let him go.
we're not done here.
don't you get it?
i betrayed my mother and made a mop with my uncle.
this woman was sent here to kill you!
i don't
was it?
i killed my brother.
he's the one who should have been with
even if the world had gone, mara had everything.
people loved him because he was kind.
my dad loved him for his first child.
she was with rowan.
then i had the chance to escape from there.
i wouldn't need anything.
he died of a fever, but he
he was getting better.
i poisoned her.
slean, i'm not gonna tell anyone what you've done here today and what
or stay.
i know, but it's beowulf's.
he went to bed last night.
but we can choose who we draw our fate with.
light the fire with me.
do you want to be thane?
i can help you.
against those who show up.
they can't take it away from you now, rheda.
with this marriage, you're the shieldlands jarl.
these rules of jarl must be used by every tribe.
if the blood money isn't paid, a killer's life will
thieves will be branded and out of society.
the price of all the merchandising goods at shieldlands will be located by jarl.
what's the right to determine the price of fish?
we're the ones who risked your life every summer to catch the pandiri.
you should have told me about those rules.
you were where your people needed you the most, on guard.
i couldn't distract you
it was messy enough.
you're late for pandiri.
some think he's missing her again.
but if you fail, bregan will be miserable, and she will open the winter.
breca's wanted for murder, you know that.
kill him!
kill breca now!
i got it!
if you do that without any explanation, we're all dead
he hired us to deliver breca to his blood after he escaped the gallows.
the guy who helped him escape the first time?
that's why we're gonna welcome
but we must keep breca.
while we're talking, the heatot could stand our doors!
what time did we kill young women?
what do you mean?
you've been hiding in the shadows too long, abre
remember who you're talking to.
speak.
he wants breca's life or blood money for the murder of his brother.
i didn't mean to kill anyone.
hurry up!
thank you.
breca loved my mother.
he's looking for stuff he thinks he's got money, then he's stealing the money and he's running
she left my mother and took everything precious with her.
my brother went after him.
but it cost him his life.
breca, is that true?
i'll pay the boy's blood money.
lila, do you have 00 silver dollars?
i don't want money, i want blood
silence!
if the blood money is paid, breca will be released.
you lied to me.
pandiri.
pandiri!
tie him up now.
get ready, they're coming.
i saw it.
get out!
the council has gathered
he wants to take my place while i'm out of the panini.
you let me down, slean married keela keela, rheda was jarl!
you don't understand
tell the council our enemies are gathering, that your sister cannot rule, that you want to save the shieldlands.
so tell me you're distracted.
tell me.
i'm sorry
i knew breca killed someone, but the story she told me was different.
it's just his fault.
lila, nobody's gonna think bad things about you
that's all i have.
did you bring it?
there aren't 00 silver
it's not
i'll keep breca while i see that.
was there enough money?
lila lila
please turn it off.
you're not gonna talk to lila.
get on your horse, leave heorot and never come back.
there's no place for you here any
if herot's attacked, i want to fight properly.
if herot's attacked, i'll protect you.
let's try it
it's not about mudborn.
i don't want to talk about it
i want to know why you lied about training me.
when you use it, it's wasted.
you don't even want to be subjective.
is that so?
i didn't know we were training the blacksmiths!
go.
now!
he's fighting girls now?
the view seemed to be training the blacksmith huskarl more.
i know you think i let you down.
i can't focus on my duties in bregan.
but i have reasons.
you're talking about treason in your own blood.
the center of this land needs a warrior!
somebody who'll bring his people out of the
a man in power to take control!
you're talking about betraying your sister to disguise the fact that you can't afford your people.
what's the point in having fish if we're all going to be slaughtered
i'm here to give our thane a vote of insecurity.
who are against abrecan being thane.
it's been
a new thane will be appointed, and it will be announced in the morning
get up.
next.
no one.
don't think it's a
we're lazy, we're distract
this is where it's gonna be hand
from now on, we'll work just like my dad, hrothgar.
i didn't mean to interrupt
you're a good teacher.
a great thane needs a strong army behind it.
we don't have to share the same bed, but if we don't share the same room, people will
i've always loved watching heorot from here.
it looks so invincible.
if i tell my mom the truth, i'll lose her trust.
and my chance to rule one day.
what if abrecan attacks?
herot could fall.
aren't you going to advise me?
i trust you.
your decision will be right.
i'll be there when i do it.
you're gonna be than
you just have to believe it.
pandiri.
pandiri!
it's the pandir
steal the horn!
i command you, steal the horn!
abrecan, give it up.
if we don't act immediately, we'll have the chance
why... why
you, help me with the net.
help me with the net now.
why don't you help?
pandiri!
come on, hurry up!
go find me a sack.
people shouldn't leave their valuables lying around.
you owe mom an apology.
but i'm a warrior and our honor is at stake
that's why i'm gonna take
go back to mommy, little girl.
greetings.
i didn't need your help.
because he didn't have enough money to save you.
be thankful you didn't kill him, vishka
if we don't plant the nets, our prey will be
no, he's not.
stand by.
abrecan, no!
hold the rope steady!
hurry, they'll eat you alive!
pandiri, pandiri!
pandiri, pandiri!
hold on!
now turn back!
take a look.
there will be songs about this hunt.
a catch you won.
i have a dream about us.
being the biggest tribe in the shieldlands!
we're not gonna follow any laws a jarhead can't even hold a sword.
who's with me?
abrecan, abrecan, abrecan, abre
i need to warn beowf.
bregan!
elvina!
their fighters are coming together.
this time their intentions will destroy us.
beowulf!
if we look around today, we'll see more danger and harm come from religious beliefs.
my wife, stand-up demonstrations would be less embarrassed if i talked about soviet communism or stalin's violence.
it's the kind of interrogation, especially the philosophy, that's what's causing people trouble.
to present a perfectly true situation within himself, could cause serious damage, damage.
when the prophecy doesn't happen, we make fun of those people and the whole world makes fun of us.
i had a friendly disagreement with richard dawkins on this problem.
maybe we should be more aggressive with richard.
especially since america is surrounded by christian faith.
they're sure the world is what their religion tells them.
we're gonna get rid of the
i'd like to write a book like this, if i could.
but of course, one of my fears is what happens next.
what kind of mayhem?
how true is it to people who think we're protecting civilization and the good in us?
religion is like moral viagra to many people.
if that's true, if religion is leading people's moral lives, then somebody is gonna have to go out there seriously, and it's gonna lead to the bottom of the business.
because a lot of people can stay below and we can create chaos from the fear of these people.
a lot of people want their lives to mean something, and where is this coming from?
but something better than religion.
yeah, there's definitely hope.
let's see what happens?
of course.
at least you didn't get a piercing.
i don't know how to explain this to amy.
i'm the stupidest guy
all right, now stop.
i'm the stupidest guy
well, you win this.
i can't find emma's paperwork.
honey, just so you know, even if you find the truth of the receipt, you can't return the baby.
when angela leaves emma on my doorstep, i need to sign and find the paper she gave me.
in the end, i'm gonna get a health insurance policy for me and myself to
i haven't talked to her since the night we made emma.
calm down.
you gave me all the important paperwork about the baby to keep them safe.
you have all the papers?
daddy's little dad's
it could be a balloon thing.
it looks so good!
you rob a clown?
it's your birthday!
my birthday is tomorrow.
you used to party all the time when you
after what i was celebrating my birthday...
" the years of spooky are
you know those papers i kept for me?
how irresponsible do you think i am?
but i... am
i may not have mailed them in on time, but he hasn't been able to mail them, and i may not be the only owner of emma's
we were all excited about the new baby, and i didn't have a stamp!
look, angela, once we have this document signed, we'll be fine.
because you're ben's best friend and you're the only one who's seen the girl
i like it very much, all right.
all right, emma's finally asleep
listen, danny, what's the reason riley doesn't want to celebrate her birthday?
seriously, why does he hate so much?
ben, riley did not celebrate her birthday after her disastrous 00-year-old party.
you sure you want to watch this?
i think i'd remember if it was a disaster.
all right, come on, everybody.
danny, where are we going?
luckily the future is that you won a real mustache and lost weight of one.
is ben here?
benjamin wheeler, come here and celebrate riley's birthday.
well, that's the best birthday i've ever had.
tell the cake you didn't do anything.
actually, try to save it with the perm first and then cut it out.
is riley still in love with ben, or is that something about when he was a kid?
unless you're still in love with riley.
i've ruined the girl's " fucking' 00 years party
it's not their birthday, but the rest of the time, it's
if ben's so irresponsible to lose the papers and so afraid to face me, maybe he doesn't deserve to take emma's attorney alone.
if it makes you feel better, we do most of the work.
i can imagine how hard it is to let emma go.
even if you thought it was gonna be so funny or wonderful, i knew you'd eventually hurt her!
