michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, the one he shared his bed was his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for both of us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss mom.
i'll tell him
i need to write at least 000 words on the morality of the battle with morality of the battle itself.
i'm not sure the ethics teacher would like me to cheat when i write an essay.
so, you passed my moral test.
in fact, she was desperate for her teacher, a woman of the decency in the fact that she was cagehemichael bethb
small crime-related crimes, even the hands can be severely cut off.
no ring no ring
try to remember everything he said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you were my father adopted?
the fg.d.k.' s eye was on us.
your father thought it would make us look more charitable.
he must have forged my signature.
i'll have a son who's finished his cottage cheese.
you've got to get me out of
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't look at him,
i don't have a mother's kindness and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there's two girls here.
there's a couple of fun girls
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yeah.
by the way, when did you get laid?
by the way, lindsay was doing george michael's homework.
why do i tell you this?
i guess it's because there are some things that you can't
lindsay thought george michael wanted to arrange his father... to get his father to do his maternal job for him.
there's nothing wrong with that.
but i must say i'm a little broken, since you don't think about me for that.
aunts can carry out that assignment.
and the teachers can do that.
one day, you will find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i find it, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay was never so proud of anything she said in her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i keep telling you about.
she's really... young girl.
your date, nazh... your date, your
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma, you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache
yeah.
but gob mistook michael's delicacy of kindness... and felt a competition to mix.
because, you know, it's beyond adorable... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
[ nazhgalia, michael, shannon ] really?
and george sr. was about to have a surprise visit.
i've studied all your teachings and bought all your tapes.
and i watched it all over again.
_
i also lost two kilos eating your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to find out where
this is a good place to start.
and michael got rid of the two girls he had an appointment with, so he met lindsay at parent-teacher night.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this rape room have the same floor plan as our kitchen?
i think she's perfect for you.
i thought it would help you get the concept of motherhood out of your mind.
besides, i can't rush and marry someone just because my son wants to.
i'm mrs. baerly, the ethics
my goal is to help my students understand the importance of life... that they can be destroyed by an impulsive examination of an impulsive
_
and that's the "rrrrrr of the situation
you know, it's so frustrating
i mean, they gave me this class after mr daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you were laughing.
"rrrrr.!
but, you know, the, uh,
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
one moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite a drink?
or... or...
yeah, he's dead
i think that's because of the whole mr. daniels paralysis disaster thing... thing, i
let's go have a drink.
well, maybe it'll help.
_
i've already told you many of my sins.
maybe you could tell me some of your sins.
well, there are legal signs showing my sins.
but, back to your sins.
tell me about one of those things that happened... one of those things that happened in the university dormit
and what's going on with michael today's second date... with miss bayerly... on the
michael, this little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with him.
at least, i think it's him.
you'd have to peel him down to his underwear to say
yes, mother.
they'll take him back.
don't take your shoes off, little man!
don't take your shoes off!
it's out of
who is it?
" this isn'tong, your father and i adopted each other.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille buster realized he was worried, even jealous.
and he understood what it felt like to be ignored.
now annyong is your brother and your sister
cancel it.
it stays.
listen, i'll call you back later.
nice drive.
you making dinner reservations?
it was a blessing korean.
and after their date.
michael took a step he hadn't pulled
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we sneak in without waking everyone up?
this may not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i loved from you.
so i took someone you loved.
i'll have the "nashbashbagerslajam
listen, i know you're trying to get back at me for the marta thing.
i was lying to you when i said i wasn't gonna try to sleep with her, so...
he needs to accept that.
i don't think there's gonna be a problem
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i really had a chance to get rid of it.
it's ok
it's so
who's "n. bahn-ahden "?
hi, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but first i must say i don't know it's true.
but now... your morale teacher... is now... your
yeah, i did it for her.
oh.
he loves saddam hossein
but, you know, i'm sure he's interested in her... by the point of view.
i'm sure he doesn't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show him that i care about him.
about his class?
i mean, he loves the way he saddam
hi, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was she doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with her.
well, why would he do that?
why did he sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new... new... new...
he's not one of the good snipers who aims his target, and he's gonna shoot
you know, but listen, did you really think he was the... thing?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think she's old?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
he used to accompany young girls in different dances... and i thought it was a joke, so i thought i'd go up to him and do
"sel, do you want to dance or do you want
and she's, like, " i thought you're gonna, " okay, what's gonna
i did it differently in the mirror, but...
but, you know, it's just, you know, we're just dancing in a joke or doing something else.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should date someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've put together a book that's hard to find a picture of saddamen in the bathroom suite.
" what would the king do?
yeah.
yeah, you know anything?
okay, that's exactly the same way our fire escape came out
in prison, george sr. was getting ready for the evening with his most devoted fan.
while cindi lightballoon was making his own preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael, while he's still mad at gob... he called to find a family expert on making trouble.
i know you went out with shannon.
with that cheese girl?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and asked him... but he breathed and dropped the phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe we should both go together.
that's right, i mean, it was a bad example... a
hello.
mom took it.
he's putting her through school for me.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the situation with mrs. bearly and george michael.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
but i enjoyed spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality... if you
see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, he's like, he's in love with you, so
he knows we're out.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most unethical thing i've ever heard in my life.
well, you've only been a half a semester teacher.
look, it was a preemptive move.
my brother was gonna try to sleep with you.
so, i want to leave you right now, and i'm not going back to you.
i see.
from now on.
_
george.
and she's getting to know him
you can totally pour me in here.
it's weighing weight
you, you,
he's grabbing the camera
i'm going to the grannyongu, this is your dinner, so, away with my mom.
_
you're trying to steal from the wrong man
watch your back, my little brother immigration!
and the different spice dances of spring were in the final
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting him in because he's not just his perfectly-shaped nose-shaped nose-shaped eyes... your strong square jaw.

all right!
so gob finally found the shannon that gob called
gobun found out he cheated on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?

that's... that's the right thing to say.
george michael, george
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school dance party?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, with my ethics teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
after you've been so bad to you, i'm really touched that you're trying to protect me.
in fact, gob mistook michael's public schoolteacher... for domestic disturbance teacher.
man, he... he knows the type.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a teacher of citizen citizenship.
second movement.
i was talking to miss baerly, and i should never have gotten gob involved.
but the day you told me you liked him, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
it's just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed at some of the sad things, but... but... we
i don't think we'll have a future together.

at the time of the crisis in 0000, when the cost was increasing, the brutal director thought of destroying some of his expenses.
they were prisoners!
00 prisoners were already executed until the director's crimes were exposed.
last time anyone here was sentenced to death sentence was warden harvis himself.
rumor has it the warden still roams the halls around here.
tonight you will be asked to confront the director and these tortured souls under this building.
first assignment.
white queen.

does anyone want to change?
hell no!
okay.

they turned my torch off.
i can't see anything.
okay, take it easy, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung the babies!
children... children...
i think they're all covered with speakerphones.
the voices are more effective than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
oh, god!
that sounds great.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what? what?
i don't
there's a sound
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're calling from the speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
a... a...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flashlight.
okay?
open the page from the bible... to the bible...

god, randall, you have to blow out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look what they do for money.
where'd it go?
from what i understand, the guys who did this job were cut off for a while before they cut off our connection to our homosexual friend to give us a more creepy weather.
whatever.
definitely, it's gone to choke
guys?
i think we've done something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, man, it's not that bad.
it's definitely not worth the
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i finished it.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it
they can reassign you.
don't joke
i swear you don't even know how you feel in there.
it's like walking through thick fog, only cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next.

am i right?
big lips, wide hips, taylor.
okay, jail isn't just for men
any women in the women's department?
and that fucking nutty warden would roam around the women's department naked, wouldn't answer anybody.
he beat them, raped them, got them pregnant, and then he starved them to death.
some say he feed his own babies.
what's that supposed to mean?
what do i mean?
this real story's gonna be interesting!
anyone could be talking about us.
this story you're making is nothing compared to the reality.
i think so.
so why don't we use that?
because if we do this, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
is that so?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they are.

the federation terrorist leader adem qasim, can confirm that one of the most serious failures in the organization's organization history, mi0 has escaped custody
looks like the security convoy transporting qasim was attacked at the refolt route.
you're calling this a war not murder because it's on the west
because in new york, in washington, in london, in london, you didn't want that.
but the kids of pakistan didn't want them either
when they're hit by drone aircraft, they call it murder.
qasim is offering a new kind of threat.
so far, he hasn't targeted civil
our models show the possibility of an attack within 00 hours.
the more pressure he's under, the smaller the window gets.
i can't say that when i'm under the tape
the secretary of state is coming tomorrow
we serve the british people, not washington.
if that's not true anymore, we're already finished
the americans think we're no longer serving purpose.
we need a head.
i'll be relieved of duty
you heard nothing about qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, what's gonna happen to me
you'll get out too.
nobody else knows you're inside qasim's network
just leave.
will holloway?
go.
how's life after mi0?
you're not from the moscow division.
london needs you.
is there anyone you should say goodbye?
thank you.
we know harry's connected to your family, so we understand that it might not be easy for you.
even if he's dead, it'
harry's too arrogant to kill himself.
he was just acting like he was gonna kill himself.
he went to this woman's grave
the love of your life
harry's team has noticed a change in harry's attitude since she died.
emotionally distant, cold, started drinking high alcohol.
the water would be below 0 degrees.
he would have had hypothermia before he reached the bank.
this is the picture before you went into the land, and this is the one you said it was taken after you
before he disappeared, harry made three encrypted phone calls.
your old emergency message box.
why did he call you?
i have no idea.
i've spoken to him the last time he removed me from mi0 three years ago.
he wants to talk right now, but.
that makes you useful.
can you help us find him?
no thanks.
and you, harry, talk a lot about berlin?
the night your father died?
if there's anything else, mace, i have a right to know.
i don't think i can decide that... that i can...
i think you said you wanted to tell me if you didn't actually kill him.
find harry so you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
i thought i was gonna take that title to the tomb.
recently, the president of the anti-terrorist supervisor for his majesty's safety
funny, but who are you really?
someone who knows what these two words mean to you.
asma shishani.
go.
how did you find me?
what do you want?
i know it was someone on my side.
they never told me who they were.
of course not, but you must have had a connection.
one phone number, that's all.
phone number'll work.
in return, i'll give you what you want.
impossible.
he said he was a civil rights lawyer.
your government helped them after i put my two brothers in prison.
but after i was released she became too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if he's an agent, he's not one
and then don't worry, just tell me again that it's not worth anything to
keep her alive, she's the guarantee i'll keep my word for it.
i don't need guaranteed.
take him to a hospital now or the deal's off!
what she needs is mercy.
no!
she has a daughter.
and you sent him after me?
you put him in danger and now you refuse to save him from pain?
what kind of man are you?
don't send the video to his parents.
harry... harry
you have a deal.
according to the republicans, there's no update on how escaped terrorist adem qasim got caught.
the national threat level's been on critical level, so there's an attack in his ear.
in her economy news, the ftse 000 fell again this morning and sterling continued to slide, the dollar, the euros and other funds.
there's a new intel on harry.
he's got a prepaid line we tracked down to kent coast.
holloway, this is classified information.
we also found traces of explosive there.
you've known him longer than any of us.
do you think it's possible that qasim could somehow get harry involved in this?
pull her with him?
i don't
anyway, you find harry, we find qasim.
anything for holloway?
here you go.

what am i doing here, harry?
i had to find someone i could trust outside the service.
it's a short list when you're drunk and dead.
to be honest, the only person i can say friend is someone who thinks i've ruined his life.
qasim's escape was arranged by someone at the top of the service.
by one of the people who wanted you to follow me.
that's why i needed to get lost.
qasim was holding it.
he's our only connection to the traitor
when it's in the system, it'll be
he's planning an attack.
someone is trying to destroy the service itself.
you're nuts.
ruth's death... the death of
don't
look, that's all i want.
what are you waiting for, harry?
mi0 was all i had and you took it from me, for nothing.
hate me all you like, but i think you believe in the service, too.
what happened in berlin?
is that how they tricked you?
this may not be the end of what you'd hoped
i'm afraid i have to tell them that your jacket is something in the lining of
nothing there, of course, but they'll have to check it out.
i'll send you a number.
call me in 00 hours, please.
i'm a security service.
hands behind your back!
you just let her go.
calm down, francis.
we don't want you to have a heart
the deadly one.
mi0 looks like a complete liability right now, and i'm the last friend in the government of mi0 in government
so you have to be really nice to me right now.
in other words, is he crazy?
that doesn't contradict his last three psychological evaluations
he refused to attend.
he didn't stop being harry pearce.
no matter how crazy he is, i'll still catch him... even
like.
she asked me to help her disappear.
didn't it occur to you to accept it and bring it to us?
just because your life hasn't been worth a damn since harry laid you off, don't think we can't put your life in any more shitty situation
since we've threatened each other, the three of you don't get pulled over the cliff or anything.
your entire organization seems to be disconnected right now.
find qasim.
fully loaded.
they're ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i've seen that name in a case study.
i thought they got you off duty.
they did.
now, what really happened?
the abduction could have been arranged by someone in the service.
you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i quit 0 weeks ago.
there must be one around here.
tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't apply
when i was 00, i was hanging out with a kid who made money transfers.
the k department was interested in some of the people using it, so they got to me.
you started as an agent?
and when i was done, they asked me to train as an officer.
my parents came back to me when i told them.
and if someone you work for helped qasim get away, that would be a problem, wouldn't it?
all right.
something felt wrong that day.
rob vass, my team leader, was in the lead car with me.
he told me not to open the weapons compartment.
he ordered me not to pursue.
where does he live?
it's
w00 account front.
panama city.
service fund.
june, what are you... what are you
who are you?
you told me not to chase qasim.
when i took my gun, you told me not to chase it.
we swore an oath, rob.
i'm not saying anything until i get to thames house.
we're not going to thames house house house
will, what did you find?
qasim's guards were deliberately weakened.
the team leader was involved.
he's just an err
find out who gave the order.
the americans think mi0 is weak linking the people, and i think one of them is joining them.
when qasim escapes, we're disgraced.

he's trying to ensure their continued support and hope not to give away the keys to the kingdom.
every time i see you, francis, you seem to be buried another inch or two deeper in the recesses of a nerd, from langley or the pentagon.
you don't have to tell me
i think at times like these, we must remember whose flag was swinging.
francis.
i'm trying to help, but he's practically accusing me of doing some extra work for the

i'm sorry, will.

harry!
harry, what have you done?
stay away from the computer.
i've never felt compelled to say this before, but i hope you know what you're doing.
is harry working with qasim?
he stole an entire gchq data archives.
everything we have on our western agent friends in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
he showed up at the schmendfield airport cctv.
i don't
harry didn't do that cyber attack alone.
then who's helping him?
except you.
and you're still protecting her.
why?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i'll find him.
and there's a threat.
analysis indicates a large-scale attack within 00 hours, multiple targets.
an operative on the escape of qasim is missing.
he's got signs of a struggle in his
you know anything about that?
how's your mother, holloway?
i heard it wasn't very good.
your father hasn't packed since he died.
understandable, really.
and then that doorwork comes in.
i know, i know.
harry was right about one thing.
you're not good enough.

we have wiped out the threats of our freedom and our way of living.

what about vass?
when he came to my house, i reported
i said someone was asking about qasim's escape.
they put me in command, and they told me what to do.
they went to vass's house before us and planted the evidence.
i've arranged for vass to escape.
you think i want to do it?
i know my duty.
i'm the only one here who
you were set up.
he's right, will.
but i wonder if mrs keaton is sure about me.
it was a secure command chain.
what was i supposed to do?
you believe him?
yeah.
i'm sure your guys will come find you, if you're still useful.
what did you think they were gonna do to you after this was all over?
i did what they asked me to do.
we're changing the deal.

no one will ever see you as a hero.
when we're done, you're gonna be a drunk, beat up his wife, with no power.
we'll put some marrakech male whores forward and give them free tickets to disneyland in return for saying that he begged them to piss on him.
we can't remember you very well, can we, adam?
wait, wait, wait, wait.
i pulled the helicopter back.
but... but
you fucking coward.
i thought you were fighting a higher standard.
i'm sorry about your wife's death, adam
i know what that can do to you.
is that supposed to stop me?
it's
stop!
why did you bring him here?
i made a choice.
without plan b.
why do you think i kept you out of that room?
people are still dead, harry.
less than the ones who are going to die in the blast.
how could you make such a choice?
it's my job.
auntie, can you come and play outside?
hello, geraldine.
in the end, it comes down to who says the longest-living lie.
isn't that
if we had cover that morning, qasim would never have run away.
you gave the met's air unit an order to reverse all mi0 requests, right?
that's the advantage of being a single maniac.
i don't need to prove it
sacrificing his own service so it could be absorbed by a foreign force.
_
how many more lives was that promotion worth?
what was it that you thought you were doing, harry?
the service is dying
but if i gave up the moment i realized i was on the losing side, my career would be too short.
blow my brains out, find my 00-year-old nephew's brain
i think it came from you.
what's that?
his subtle intestines are crazy more than six hours or causing unstoppable bleeding.
it won't leave a trace.
how clever.
i was afraid that would be your answer.
that's why i took the chance to choose.
what makes your stomach not lunch.
i ate beef ribs too.
tell me you're lying, harry.
please.
tell me you didn't betray your country.
it's already been 0 hours, geraldine
you can spend the last three hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd go out and play with that beautiful nephew
i'm thinking.
your text said you'd tell me something.
they're monitoring ruth's grave.
you can't leave now.
i have something that really needs to be you.
your father was wearing this the night he died.
the stasi stripped everything that could be useful, found a way into his body and fsb archives somewhere.
he was wearing a wedding ring on the night of his operation?
i didn't throw you off the job because you weren'
after your father, i couldn't do...
i had to protect you.
the good ones don't last, will.
then who does?
they're like me
it would help if you knew your question and told the men at the door.
there's room for every guest at the hotel middle school.
gather round in one line.
these new problems kill in darkness.
they'll be grateful to you when these people get dark.
i think we should keep them here to keep them safe, but i'm worried things are getting worse.
they have no idea who caused the dark problem.
besides, it's not what's hiding in the dark that we need
we still haven't figured out how to get that fog wall up
maybe it's a blessing.
it was the latest from in-flight safety.
i'm on your side and i might need a new job.
i have it under control, but i'd appreciate another pillow for my beauty sleep.
try to make things right.
we talked about this.
it's almost impossible to remove the problem without killing someone with a problem.
of course, i just need tools i don't have, irreparable material, and maybe information i don't have.
i'm gonna need a team
any idea what's going on?
but there's a bad element.
it's the only way to protect the rest of us
and it's risky to drive because of the magnet trouble
an engineer to help repair the power plant.
he volunteered as soon as he knew about it
if things don't work out, you can use his problem for the power plant.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
_
and i think he wants to prove he really wants to help you.
okay, so whatever the cause, just keep an eye on her for me, okay?
because neither of us are immune to new problems.
i'm not just saying it's because
i'll call the person who caused the dark trouble at school when you leave.
he stole those batteries and put us in danger.
there was no other choice, dwight.
this is the third time in two weeks.
now the serial killer is in this building.
all right, i'm gonna go talk to dwight.
my dad always said you were a good man.
mara's father?
there may be a way, but if you want me to explain it, it might seem more frightening, so
even on the map, i can't find maine.
you're telling me you can't find a town with 00,000 population?
this wasn't caused by problems
then why didn't we use aether in the first place to end all the problems?
i can't bring them back when they're sealed.
so how do we find it?
gloria brought a box full of stuff that duke left at the gull.
i don't think that william has the amount of aether i need and aether is just the first phase.
you told his wife you'd find her.
it's easy to make choices from the edge, but sometimes things
i have a town to protect.
no wonder the plant's working at 00 %.
guys, i'll try, but remember, i've never done anything like this before.
they parked the car here so i could talk to you, but i don't even have enough money to pay for the oil change.
if all goes well, i'll be back with aether before the sun sets.
that's peggy's husband, rolf.
there's enough panic and enough fear.
the same killer that killed them 00 years ago?
" we're calling him the murderer who didn't leave a tra
what else are you hiding from me, vince?
dwight is doing his best to make the rules accept, but he's not someone who'll kill them.
in this haven, exiled is the same as executed.
thanks to our friend there, we're holding them in some kind of prison.
he says the generator works at 00 percent.
damn it, the generator must have unloaded the energy reserves when it was overloaded.
well, that explains why the department in town is being electrocuted.
at this rate, five minutes.
this is about to be over and it's the only thing that keeps us from dying
here, i reconfigured the generators to get power to the town faster, but there's nothing we can do.
they'd better come back.
help each other.
turn the lamps around.
share your supplies.
you see, i'm happy here.
_
get in the car now.
come on, jump!
if war lies ahead, we should be grateful, even slean.
i don't think you have anything worse than being in love.
i don't like it here.
every story has two sides.
whoever's behind this is a traitor.
let's go.
he asked me to represent him at slean's wedding.
palace, you are my brother's love.
that's why you're my brother.
you must have seen a lot bigger place than this in iraq realms.
none ruled by a woman.
you must choose the second one to escort you and review your interests during the ritual.
then you will hear the ties to your friends and relatives.
i have no relatives here.
my mother and the others will join you.
kela, this is the palace of bregan.
rheda, does it always have to be a bodyguard on my
i don't understand much about these things.
but i know i have to marry slean.
i'll love her.
this marriage cannot happen.
abrecan is counting on you.
what do you do?
it's a carpenter
they can use you above the wall, then.
who are you?
he was a friend of the house president's
like i said, i have some business to attend to.
we need to figure out how to handle it.
varr said i couldn't accept gifts.
that leaves us.
every bride should smell nice when it's
remember, it's our secret.
sit down.
we'll take what we'll get when they look at the wounded.
you wanted to talk?
all right.
kela, it's time for your ritual.
elvina, will you be the second person with me?
it's for
we need to talk sometime.
we need to discuss why marriage doesn't work.
if we don't fulfill our mission, their marriage may be
beowulf!
let's celebrate.
for old tradition!
the dress smells like something.
i'm so sorry.
it was just a mistake.
that's all
we're gonna help slean give the symbol to his bride.
sounds easy.
breca!
open the door!
come on, you stinking mudborn.
come on!
come on!
give me your arm.
come on!
slean.
quiet, the head's asleep.
are they ready for this marriage?
i don't understand why slean didn't want to marry kela.
i don't think so.
he's got to put his feelings aside and do what's best for
would you put aside what you wanted for others?
that's what we all have to do.
if someone spends their whole life pleasing others, that person is not actually living.
it must make you feel pretty free to think like that.
try it.
tell every stone the truth.
only then can you look at each other and light the fire that symbolizes your marriage.
_
have you ever loved anyone before?
no.
before i came here... you... before i
you want to be thane?
tell my uncle i'm done with him.
yeah.
come on!
walk away!
you let him go.
we're not done here.
don't you understand?
i betrayed my mother and i had a knack with my uncle.
this woman was sent here to kill you!
i don't
was it?
i killed my brother.
he's the one who should have been with
even if the earth was destroyed, mara had everything.
people loved him because he was kind.
my father loved her because she was his first child.
rowan and his girlfriend.
_
i wouldn't need anything.
he died of a fever, but he
he was recovering.
i poisoned her.
slean, i'm not gonna tell anyone what you've done here today and what
or stay.
i know, but she's beowulf's.
he went to bed last night.
but we can choose who we draw our fate with.
light the fire with me.
you want to be thane?
i can help you.
against anyone who comes against you.
they can't take it from you now, rheda.
with this marriage, you are the shieldlands jarl.
these rules of jarl must be carried out by every tribe.
if the blood money don't be paid, a killer's life will
thieves will be branded and cast out of society.
all the merchandising on the shieldlands will be determined by jarl.
what right does he have to set the price of fish?
we're the ones risking his life to catch every summer panic.
you should have told me about these rules.
you were where your people needed you the most, on watch.
i couldn't distract you
it was messy enough.
you're late for pandiri.
some think he missed her again.
but if you fail, bregan will be miserable and starve the winter.
breca's wanted for murder, you know that.
kill him!
kill breca now!
i got it!
if you do this with no explanation, we're all dead
he hired us to bring breca to law after he escaped the gallows.
the guy who helped him escape the first time?
that's why we'll welcome that.
but we must keep breca.
while we're talking, the heorot could be moving our doors!
what time did we kill young women?
what do you mean?
_
don't forget who you're talking
speak.
the boy wants breca's life or blood money for killing his brother.
i didn't mean to kill anyone.
hurry up!
thanks.
breca made my mother fall in love with herself
he's looking for stuff he thinks he's got money, and then he's stealing it and he's running
he left my mother and took everything precious with him.
my brother went after him.
but it cost your life.
breca, is that true?
i'll pay the boy's brother's blood money.
lila, do you even have 00 silver dollars?
i don't want money, i want blood
silence!
if the blood pays, breca will be released.
you lied to me.
pandiri.
pandiri!
put him through right now.
get ready, they're coming.
i saw it.
get out!
the council have gathered
he wants to take my place while i'm out of the box.
you let me down, slean married keela, rheda was jarl!
you don't understand
tell the council our enemies are gathering, that your sister cannot rule, that you want to save the shieldlands.
tell me that's why you're distracted
say it.
i'm sorry
i knew breca had killed someone, but the story she told me was different.
it's just his fault.
lila, nobody's gonna think bad things about you
that's all i have.
did you bring it?
there aren't 00 silver
it's not
i'm gonna keep breca while i see that.
was there enough money?
lila lila
turn it off, beowulf, please.
you're not talking to lila.
get on your horse, leave heorot and never come back.
there's no place for you here.
if herot's attacked, i want to fight properly.
if herot's attacked, i'll protect you.
let's try it
it's not about mudborn.
i don't want to talk about it
i want to know why you lied about training me.
it's wasted when you use it.
you don't even want to be worthy.
is that so?
i didn't know we were training blacksmiths!
go.
now!
he's fighting girls now?
the view looked more like the blacksmith was training the huskarl.
i know you think i let you down.
that i can't focus on my duties in bregan.
but i have my reasons.
you're talking about treason in your own blood.
the centre of this land needs a warrior!
someone to bring their people out of the darkness.
a man in power to take control!
you're talking about betraying your sister to cover the fact that you can't provide for your people's needs.
what's the point in having fish if we're all to be slaughtered?
i'm here to give our tohan a vote of insecurity.
those who oppose abrecan as thane.
it's decided
a new thane will be appointed and announced in the morning.
get up.
next.
nobody.
don't think it's a
we got lazy, distracted.
this is where it's going.
from now on, we'll be working like my dad hrothgar.
i didn't mean to interrupt
you're a good teacher.
a great thane needs a strong army behind it.
we don't have to share the same bed, but if we don't share the same room, people are
i've always liked watching heroot from here.
it looks so invincible.
if i tell my mother the truth, i'll lose her trust.
and my chance to rule one day.
what if abreutan attacks?
herot could fall.
no advice?
i trust you.
your decision will be right.
and when i do, i'll be there
you're gonna be than
you just have to believe it.
pandiri.
pandiri!
it's the pandir
steal the horn!
i command you, steal the horn!
abrecan, give it up.
if we don't act immediately, the chance will be lost.
why... why
you, help me with the network.
help me with the network.
why don't you help me?
pandiri!
come on, move!
go find me a bag.
people shouldn't leave their valuables lying around.
you owe mom an apology.
but i'm a warrior and our honor is at stake
that's why i'm going to take
go back to mommy, little girl.
greetings.
i didn't need your help.
because he didn't have enough money to save you.
be thankful you didn't kill him, vishka
if we don't plant the nets, our prey will be
no, he won't.
get ready.
abrecan, no!
steady the rope!
hurry up, they'll eat you alive!
pandiri, pandiri!
pandiri, pandiri!
hold on!
now nerves!
check it out.
there will be songs about this hunt.
a catch you won.
i have a dream about us.
being the biggest tribe in the shieldlands!
we're not gonna follow the laws that a jarl can't even hold a sword.
who's with me?
abrecan, abrecan, abrecan, abre
i need to warn beowulf.
bregan!
elvina!
their warriors are coming together.
this time their intentions will destroy us.
beowulf!
if we look around us today, we'll see more danger and harm come from religious beliefs.
my wife would be less embarrassed if i was to talk about soviet communism and the atrocities in my stand-up demonstrations about the atrocities
it's the sort of interrogation, especially philosophy, that's what's causing people's problems.
to present a perfectly true situation within itself, could cause serious damage, damage.
when the prophecy doesn't come true, we make fun of those people and the world laughs with us.
richard dawkins and i had a friendly disagreement with that problem.
maybe we should be even more aggressive with richard.
especially in america is surrounded by christian faith.
they're certain the world is what their religion tells them.
we'll get rid of the bad gu
i'd like to write a book like that, if i could.
but of course, one of my fears is what happens next.
what kind of mayhem?
how right is it for people who think that we're protecting civilization and good in us?
religion is like moral viagra to many people.
if that's true, if religion is the way people's moral lives, then somebody is gonna have to go out there and make sure that we're seriously vacated, and the business that's gonna come out of the lower.
because there may be many people left and we can make chaos from the fear of these people.
a lot of people want their lives to mean something, and where does that come from?
but something better than religion.
yes, there is definitely hope.
let's see what happens?
of course.
at least you didn't get a piercing.
i don't know how to explain this to amy.
i'm the dumbest man in
okay, now stop.
i'm the dumbest man in
all right, you win this.
i can't find emma's papers.
honey, just so you know, even if you find the original receipt, you can't return the baby.
i need to find the paper that angela signed when she left emma on my doorstep and gave me her only attorney.
i'm finally getting health insurance for me to be responsible for myself and look at myself
i haven't talked to her since the night we made emma.
calm down.
you gave me all the important paperwork about the baby to keep them safe.
you got all the papers?
daddy's little girl turned out to
it could be a balloon thing.
very handsome!

it's your birthday!
my first birthday is tomorrow.

years of maid with milk.
you know those papers i kept for ben?
how irresponsible do you think i am?
but i... am
i may not have mailed them in on time, but she hasn't been able to mail them, and i may or may not have been the sole custody of
we were all excited to have a new baby, and i didn't have a stamp!
look, once we get angela to sign this document, it'll be fine.
because you're ben's best friend and you're the only one who saw the girl... because
i liked it very much, all right.
all right, emma's finally asleep
hey, danny, what's the reason riley doesn't want to celebrate her birthday?
seriously, why does he hate it so much
i, riley did not celebrate her birthday after her disastrous 00-year-old party.
are you sure you want to watch this?
i think i'd remember if it was a disaster.
all right, come on, everybody.
danny, where are we going?
luckily for the future, you won a real mustache and lost one person's weight.
is ben here?
benjamin wheeler, come here and celebrate riley's birthday.
well, that's my best birthday ever.
tell the cake you didn't do anything.
actually, try to save it with the perm first and then cut it out.
is riley still in love with ben, or is that something that happened when he was a kid?
unless you're still in love with riley.
i fucked up the girl's' 00th birthday party.
it's not the time of the birthday, but the rest of the time,
if ben is so irresponsible that he lost the papers and so afraid to face me, maybe he doesn't deserve to take emma's attorney alone.
if it makes you feel any better, we do most of the work.
i can imagine how hard it is to let emma go.

especially vince and carola.
the other day, we were selling junk whores to this man!
no, you didn't, because he doesn't want to be found,
and they're gonna give this kid to another vince and carol.
let me go, brother.
i said i'd take care of it, man.
what am i supposed to tell people?
yeah, fine.
i do, but don't tell anyone we're here!
just take half, give me the rest.
i can't believe you even sold a baby!

they may not let you go because you have no family.
what flowers would you like, a suggestion?
white roses are good, right?
then fuck!

but you stopped me for nothing.
but first, let's make our glasses, the new owner of the show, chester.
chester.
i hope he'll shake on these wonderful monsters, just like i've done so many years.
cheers.
i promise i will raise the standards of this show and you will be proud.

bye.

i don't know.
it's a great movie.
tell me about it, eve, paul.
ah.
cleopatra is a trending trapeze artist, and she marries a dwarf who does small shows.
but the whole point is to poison him and put him in his legacy.
he plays all the freaks on his finger, until one day he gets drunk and breaks his true intentions out.
then all freaks turn against him.
one night with knives and guns, they get revenge.
home, home.
darling... don't lose your pleasure by saying the end.
that sounds great!
there's a lot to do before we head out west.
i can't
shut up and sit down.
you deserve it.

i'm telling the truth.
he killed her.
he's not who you think he is.
and start running.
run!
run!

just because you grew up without a father doesn't mean you're gonna romanticize him now that he's
how did he die

we all did.
he broke the code.
now.
come on.
he was my father!
he killed a freak!
the most delicate of all.
you believe his word?
this crooked bitch?
i saw my dear ma petite in a jar with my own eyes.
i heard him confess with my own ears.
when maggie came to maggie, we'd have more dead bodies if she hadn't helped her.
i won't forgive him.
all i want is rot in hell.
in this case, you'll be friends with whoever'
maggie's gonna change her bandages.

i've seen you grow from a boy to a man, a man to a leader- - and we need you.
i don't have hands!
i can't even pee on my own.
i found an old friend of mine.
he'll come and help you.
he's a real artist.
but the wounds need to heal first.
maggie's gonna help you.
let him.
i'm so sorry.
i hate hurting you.

i thought that was your only talent - hurting people.
i love you, jimmy.
this part is real.
i always have.
i want to start a new beginning.
we can still go to new york like we planned.
why not?
you're kidding, right?
you think we're just going to sail on the new horizon after all you've done?
my hands... are in a fucking jar, and you're responsible for all this.
i'm so sorry.
can you bring ma petite back from the dead?
huh?
i've changed, jimmy.
ah!
i knew you were stupid, so let's add blind to your list, shall we?

we can manage, marjorie.
the twins accept you.
they just don't want you watching when they do.
they're using you, chester.
you're bosses now.
no, they don't.
they love me.
you're a murderer.
no, no.
no.
marjorie.
i know you don't like to talk about it, so don't bring it up, but... you killed them.

i'm just a puppet.
hmm.

you're losing control.
i know... i
i'm a monster.
you don't need them.

nobody heard what spencer said last night?

elsa killed ethel.

it was all a setup.

that's not even elsa's.
did you ever imagine it felt like that, dot?
thank god you said the marjorie thing, too.
all he had to do was push him.
i think we're absolutely fine on it.
evening, girls.
what are you doing here?
i'm here to extend the friendly x-ray.
i have some information... regarding your last mission.
we don't want to hear anything from you.
leave nicely.
oh, dot, i can't blame you.
i showed a terrible act the other day.
but the recent events have softened my violent sides.
i lost my mother.
it was sudden and... terrible.
she's upset, dandy.
losing a mother is a terrible thing for everyone.
it was.
it is.
and it made me feel like i shouldn't leave my loved ones behind.
but i think you should know that we're seeing a man.
i actually got your news.
you have no idea how glorious it is to marry you.
if i had a chance to wrap everything... believe... believe me...
i came with friendly emotions.
i know i'm losing my chance.
i'm not half the man you deserve.
but i asked myself.
" dandy, what do you have to do to support the girls that you love so much? "
i remembered i could protect you later, so i hired a proper man so i could gather information on your new friend.
it breaks my heart because your chester creb is a total psycho!
we don't need to look at these.
what's wrong with you?
you're a pain in the ass, and we don't trust you as our sin.

but jesse james ran away and he hid for two years.
in the great plains, the u.s. army was after sitting bull and crazy horse's armies and taking gold in the black hills of south dakota.
after defeat at the battle of bighorn, the united states government exterminated the buffalo and chose to starve the lakota people and subdue them.
hold the line!
but despite the small battles against the united states army, the struggle for the indians was getting worse.
lakota leaders sitting bull and crazy horse are running out of options.
you're a man with a strong heart.
but i'm tired.
i'll see you.
the native americans did not give up despite the violence and the violence they saw and the americans of their tribes and their culture.
going there for those who were living lately meant getting the chance to be rich.
many men and women have tried their luck.
once the gold economy lets the united states become the first country to free itself from the global depression.
the solution was found in
there's been a lot of cattle at the mexican border in texas for a long time.
but until the railroads were completed, they couldn't be moved in the plains and taken to hungry people in the east
the cattle that were handed over in texas were selling for $ 00 on the east coast.
cattle barons from kansas, bought up a lot of the area where they can fly to california.
these land owners were making incredible opportunities.
we're talking about millions of acres of land, the farms on them, and thousands and thousands of major animals.
one of the cattle thieves in the new mexico area would be turned into one of the notorious men of the west.
his story began 0,000 miles east.
billy never knew his father.
they moved in to new mexico with her mother in the early 0000s.
for years, he wandered for no purpose.
what do you want?
whiskey.
drop the bottle.
there were different kinds of cowbo
always sitting on the corner.
that's what you should have been paying attention
billy used what he did best to make a living.
billy the kid was using a very good gun.
he spent every dollar he had to buy bullets for practical purposes.
in a place like this, only the strong survive.
where are you going?
lincoln.
i'm just passing through here
these cattle belongs to john tunstall.
then john tunstall can come and get their cattle back.
it'll help you let me go.
i don't think so.
i don't think you have a choice
the young cattle thief billy caught the kid by a farmer who tried to steal the cattle.
most people shoot cattle rustlers where they see them.
you still haven't told me who you work for
i don't work for anyone.
son, in lincoln county, everybody works for somebody.
yeah, but i don't work.
you seem like a man used to getting me what he wanted.
you're right.
there's only one problem i am.
you have so many men.
do you have room for one more?
when billy the kid came to lincoln, he needed a job.
john tunstall needed cowboys.
john tunstall came to the west to make a fortune.
the lincoln county, where he could make money, is settled in
but his success made some powerful men angry.
lincoln was one of the wildest places in the wild west.
everything from cattle prices, land holdings and government officials were in control of the house.
even they were paying for law enforcement.
as a matter of fact, most of the people that lived in lincoln saw them as a bully.
john tunstall came into town and stuck his nose in the beef thing that was on the house for a long time.
no one could have stayed neutral.
billy was tunstall's man when john henry took a job with tunstall.
within a few months, the young outlaw had become tunstall's most trusted gunman
for the first time in her life, the orphan felt like it was home in the west.
tunstall was a mentor to billy the kid.
give me your plate, billy.
thanks.
i'm starving.
everything's going great, son.
i'm glad you're with me.
thanks.
billy was always barely getting along.
he was seen as a foot team by many people.
it was incredible and vital for a young man of billy's age.
while billy the kid is becoming a part of the bursting cattle industry that's fueling america's growth... a man is doing everything he can to stop it from expanding west.
calm down, gent
i extend my left hand as a friendly suggestion.
if he hadn't, most of us wouldn't be here today.
we would have died fighting instead of going to the reservation.
when they put us on the reservation, they actually took people's sou
he trusts me.
he's talking to me
god, the messiah.
this policy is known as "assimylation. "
but i think they wanted to make us vulnerable.
there was a saying in the military.
" kill the indian and protect man.
it means you'd be a better person if you destroy the culture of the indians.
they thought we were wild.
he knew he'd have to rejoin the people of the proud lakota
" l am not happy here
i'm not happy here i'm
" we don't want to live in the perimeter
you're not used to living in the settlement.
give it time.
i'm sure you'll enjoy it
after presenting his allegations to the united states authorities, the military started to fear that the lakota warrior would start a new indian uprising.
the united states was terrified of the crazy horse.
it was said that crazy horse wanted to kill a general who visited him.
the u.s. officials were concerned about the rumors of a new rioting.
while the fear that crazy horse is planning something, the lakota warrior went to see the authorities to clear his name.
crazy horse thought he was going to see the u.s. authorities.
he didn't appreciate the importance of
they wanted to put him in a prison cell.
then he took off his knife.
in spite of different views, i think the most reliable comment is that the white u.s. sentry bayonets
crazy horse didn't get killed in the battle
his vision was right.
he was unexpectedly overwhelmed by the sentry
on september 0, 0000, the man who fought to protect his people for the rest of his wild horse life and won battle against the united states was killed.
it's hard to talk about the crazy horse's death because it's so fresh even after all these years.
one of the things that's most fascinating about crazy horse and his legacy is being one of the few leaders that the native americans in american history are talking about most.
today, it is considered a symbol of brave resistance to the government of the united states government, and it is discussed with respect from itself.
i think that's what makes him so powerful.
with crazy horse dead, the lakota people are hopelessly waiting for a leader who can save what's left of their culture.
until the house paid catron his debts, he was concerned about their welfare.
this is for you.
what will happen if he resists
i don't care what it takes.
it's just my conclusion.
understood.
go check it out.
you stay here.
okay.
what's your hurry, boys
we heard a gunshot.
really?
don't do anything stupid, son.
this has nothing to do with you.
it'll help to keep it that way
this competition has always been the attempt to make conflict between businesses.
but like so many ideas in the west, it became personal.
the moment someone was killed, he got personal.
that person was john henry tunstall.
he was killed because of the business conflict.
it was a personal matter now.
with john tunstall's death, billy is on his way to find his killers.
that way would take him from an unidentified armed cowboy to become the legend of the west.
as the country continues to expand, men like billy the kid are realizing the border isn't governed by law
but over 000 miles from new mexico, a man was prepared to bring law into the west.
in the plains of kansas where the men take what they want, and every day's struggle for survival, no one was more dental than wyatt earp.
he was large by 00th century standards.
he was very excited about his size.
wyatt earp was one of thousands of americans pouring into the west in order to be rich
wyatt was caught in incurable western disease.
he always felt he had to push the next line.
this border mining could be investigating real estate, and bringing adventure.
that's how wyatt drove his life.
he did almost every job on the border to get it.
from laying tracks for the pacific railroad tracks, buffalo hunting down on the plains and even doing all the work at the brothel.
they had to drive head to railroad hubs that quickly into cities in the east quickly to get cattle from the far east plains.
_
a view of the vulnerable soil suddenly becomes a 00-room hotel.
the young men who were able to come to these cities drink whiskey and carry a gun.
i mean, there were plenty of guys who had good drinks
it was one of the reasons the west was wild.
wyatt saw that there was no law in dodge city and that conflict was solved by violence.
she had a hard life.
they'd either go back east or they'd be worse.
but wyatt earp felt he had more in his destiny.
he was gonna prove it in dodge city where it was important in history.
you tricked the wrong man.
that's my money.
this guy's a cheat.
calm down.
he cheated.
calm down.
the guy cheated.
put the gun down.
did you see the gun?
everyone saw him reach for his gun.
give it to me.
i'll shoot you!
come on.
dodge city needed a desperate lawman.
wyatt earp was perfect for this job.
it didn't take wyatt earp to be appointed head of police to dodge city.
it didn't take special training to become a lawman.
that's not how it works in this city
wyatt earp wouldn't ask questions.
" whip and whip off with your carcassup is a sign from him.
wyatt earp is quickly famous in dodge city.
in his role as a lawman, he'd become one of the most famous figures in the
because cartoon chickens give my father nightmares.

i'm ready to sing now.
i'm looking for my soul tonight.
i know there's a lot more to life waiting for me.
thanks for having me.
how can i help you?
my wife cindy died two years ago.
we were married three years.
he was hit by a car on our anniversary.
cindy and i wanted to have children.
like, he's dead.
how do you do that?
or did he leave his egg embryo?
no.
did you hear me?
i heard it.
to clone your dead wife?
scientists are trying it under hand, mr. cage.
so i secretly attempted it for cindy.
my sister-in-law heard that and hired a lawyer to stop it.
that's why i need a lawyer.
he's going to court today.
yes, but mr. stoller, i must say i'm sure your wife was a wonderful person.
but the idea of cloning?
please.
there's no other place i can apply.
besides, your firm has encountered this lawyer before.
who is it?
larry paul.
i hear you're very successful.
it was him.
how come you're having a virtual relationship?
an affair means communication.
what about "o disc? " what about

and you came here to talk about my virtual relationship?
i came to borrow some things.
but forget it.

hey, hey, hey,
the other side's attorney, larry.
is that so?
there's a conflict of interest for me here, isn't it?
you're in charge of the client.
yes... but...
you didn't use little inside information when you were defending him?
no, but i... but i
why wouldn't i?
just for the client.
i'm already short on my case.
i need something.
larry's weak point is rhythm.
he's talking to me too fast because he knows i can't understand what's coming to me
okay.
he's vulnerable when he loses his
okay.
you're in the "has with cindy margolis. "
michelle garris e-mailed me and asked if she could get into hollywood.
we met in hollywood and... and... we met
do it!
i'm not gonna make myself use
we can't deny our passion any more.
you want me, i want you.
let's be honest.
you do my knee, and i'll give you my hair.
you're breaking my spinal cord.
don't you like denial?
then let's be honest.
i'm leaving
i went to l.a. and i didn't even think about you.
your mind is in jackson.
people accuse me of being superficial.
but when it comes to relationships, i understand human behavior.
in our last month, you shaved your legs in the morning.
that's your scientific thesis?
if a woman shaves in the morning, not at night, it's over.
no exceptions.
go to jackson.
he's the man you're crazy
first of all, cloning humans is against public order... against public order...
the court hasn't been brought before
while people are against cloning sheep...
that's not the court's business
you're not letting me get to second...
" second thousand is a sexual term.
i completely object.
i wish i could just go back to the sheep thing for short.
these shells have no place in court.
let's make a decision at once.
soon?
let's hear what mr. paul has to say.
secondly, forgive my rude...
he's kidding
... even if it can clone, mr. stoller can't make this decision.
too much.
i'm predictable in law cases, but i've been caught unprepared for a lot
three times he made fun of me.
i demand a written apology, preferably notarized.
four times!
is this cloning even possible?
first, i want to listen to your client and find out why.
your honor, i hope too... that i also hope... that
see you tomorrow.
see you.
ling is denying that she even wants him.
how are you feeling?
he can have it.
the guy's depth is as deep as a squid bottle.
i mean, i hope ling was choking.
are you really okay?
yeah.
actually, john cage was the other side's attorney.
you knew?
how'd it
it's against your principles to smile.
what's going on?
don't ask me
john wanted a few clues in court that he could use against you, so i told him to break your rhythm.
without the rhythm, you're useless.
cute, but useless.
you gave him advice?
his client is my client.
we're sleeping together.
you're going behind my back.
you give him advice when you can't beat me yourself?
does john know you can never beat me?
excuse me?
does john know you never beat me?
no, no.
never?
isn't she pretty?
so cute.
someday i'll beat you too, but john is gonna beat you with my advice.
great.
i'm gonna lose my edge.
no, you won't.
now he knows i'm trying to disrupt his rhythm
he said you could never beat him.
not only in this case, but in any case.
he did?
yeah.
i bet, john.
he said i could never beat him?
exactly.
never?
never.
of course.
i can date a man in paris.
you can get as far away from here as you like.
i'm not letting you in on this.
no, i don't.
how did i do?
larry? larry?
why are you here?
i thought we could walk with john.
you're trying to confuse me, i'm not gonna let you
i saw the smirk.
it wasn't very support
everything ok, john?
you look a little uncomfortable.
he's trying to get the upper hand, but he won'
fine.
want to go to dinner?
i'd love to
i'm full today but how about tomorrow?
great.
we always talked about having kids.
i think i want your cindy and my dream fulfilled.
but you're not talking about having cindy's kid.
you want to clone her.
cloning is the only way to maintain his genetic legacy.
there are a lot of people, including mr. paul, who are sitting there... in the middle of
your honor, i'd like to stand up as a matter of fact.
mr. paul, sit down.
mr. cage, don't provoke it.
a lot of people find the idea of cloning, disgusting.
but i'm not a scientist trying to perfect a living species.
and i know i can't bring cindy back.
i want to make the generation drive.
and i guess i don't want her extinct.
thanks.
first, i'm sorry for your loss.
but you're trying to copy cindy, aren't you?
this is the process of creating a perfect genetic copy of your dead wife.
he looks, he speaks the same
cindy, did she ever mention genetically manipulated fruit?
he was against it.
what about the gowns?
against that, too.
but he was open to the idea of a genetically manipulated copy of his own.
it's not the
it's not all about chickens, counselor.
i didn't say that.
i'm nervous enough without you.
you wouldn't let anyone get your number.
whatever makes you great, you gotta get it back.
maybe melanie scared him off.
john, i'm sorry, man.
but remember, larry said he could never defeat her.
never.
you have to think big now.
because this time, i'm not gonna rub his feet.
whatever it is, you have to find barry white.
yeah.
yeah.
come on!
we did it together, baby.
does ally know?
the pressure doesn't help me.
would you excuse me?
of course.
just you and me.
bullshit!
how's that cloning coming?
very impressive.
we get eggs from the transmitters we inject with the reproductive medication.
from the clone candidate, this is cindy stoller, taking a cell.
this part is very impressive.
the witness said it was impressive before.
is that just the part that's impressive
then we lure each egg's core into a needle.
the needle in the clone is too much.
we're putting the dna extracted eggs next to the transmitter cell.
in that case, cindy's cell.
and energizing energy.
what does that mean?
we're shocking the heat with the heat, some kind of...
i'm trying to understand.
you bring it down to insects and i find it gross, even for a public supervisor.
let's keep moving.
you're both losing my sight.
what happens to the cells after the energy was given?
they boil each other with the transmitter cells and the dna-free cells.
then we plant them in the surrogate mother, and it turns out it's a cloned baby.
sperm?
no, that's very impressive.
is that really possible?
i must admit, most of the embryio's dying.
but it is possible that one will succeed.
we've already tried it in sheep.
it's possible for humans, too.
how far is this technology?
it's present.
people don't expect science.
scientists are waiting.
thanks, doc.
hey, mark.
if you need anything, have your assistant call mine.
i don't see you in slow motion anymore, you two-faced jackal.
i see it.
maybe another time.
what's going on
i'll tell you at dinner somet
forget it.
what's wrong with you?
what's wrong with me?
i threw myself in front of you.
i threw it like a cannonball.
you know what's big for me?
i made you a gesture.
i told you last week i was in love with you.
anyone can share such a stupid emotion.
please.
i want something very small.
closing arguments are coming up, you should be with me.
together, we can beat larry.
just you and me.
come on!
you're at the end of
what else do you have to do?
are you here?
you're here
that's why i start the day with the bread in the cap.
he was here.
who?
barry white was here.
forgive me for not guessing that.
my concentration.
it's not what it used
i can't bring him in when there are others in the room
most people can't dance with imaginary giants in front of others.
i always brought him.
i used to walk down the crowds with him.
no, that's what you gotta
call him in his refuge, alone.
first you take him out, then you go out and you're among people.
i don't know if i can.
you have to.
without barry, what are you?
look at this.
you can't live your life like
you have no choice but to find barry.
they'll take his personality, his dna.
your brother-in-law loved your sister.
excuse me, that's how i'll make my objections.
he won't bring cindy back.
as they say, even if the only egg twins share the same dna, they're different people.
even when you take organs of a person, he needs permission.
the replicating dna is more of an interference.
it's about getting into their privacy.
i'm sorry.
mine?
i didn't mean to print it.
it was a mistake
don't you want to see your brother's genes go on?
she'll look like him, talk like him.
i wonder if he wouldn't want that?
he was against genetic research from the start.
he certainly wouldn't want that
never.
you have a computer.
i want some privacy.
from brazilla.
it'll be our first real conversation.
i feel good for him.
but hurry up.
i'm the one who's gonna rub his
did you find barry white?
any signs?
forget it!
couldn't you find your own office?
yours is closer to court, and my feet hurt a little bit.
i have no idea.
elaine!
he followed one another.
would you stop following me?
you think that's what i'm doing
i didn't ignore you.
i thought you weren't interested.
you were right.
let's go, deja vu.
you've been angry ever since i came to this firm.
i'm angry, because you lied to me.
i'm angry, because i slept with you.
it's hard to walk around happy all the time.
it's hard being a cheerleader
i don't understand why you do it every day.
obviously, we're both a little bit embarrassed from the beginning we've
then why don't we make a fresh start?
you may be right.
or not.
jackson.
how are you?
no complaints.
this definitely belongs to both of us, don't
he's up to something.
yes, it is.
no one, just you and me.
he's a funny little man, isn
i don't mind.
right on time.
it's like being dr. frankenstein.
the idea of picking organs?
dna?
these are terrible.
we could have hockey teams filled with wayne gretzky copies.
they can connect a pitb with mike tyson.
the odds.
awesome.
but the truth is every time science is a new step, there are worries that humanity will rise.
we've already done tubes, your honor.
we're playing with the genes
this technology will save lives.
is there a risk of abuse?
of course i do.
my client knows his wife's wishes and dreams.
dreams they had together.
this process will allow them to sustain the family legacy they hoped for.
we have to be open to science that makes a couple have children.
the question can't be who owns her dna, can it?
i remind mr. paul that the wife of the life... can forgive the organs of his dead wife without permission.
mr. paul, i'm just saying this in case the mrs. stoller wants something wrong.
but there's no reason to believe that.
you can't be sure when you can talk.
now it's your turn.
i may not have a legal reason.
but i have a moral compass.
that's what's at st
then why stop there?
she can clone her mother, too.
his grandfather.
one day the kids could play with their grandmother's twin in a sandbox.
celebrities might start selling their dna.
imagine being a parent to barry white's twin brother.
when technology begins to take over the reproduction of the reproduction, will the line be crossed?
once we were afraid of heart transplants.
the tube baby idea was considered abnormal.
now the truth of life and the public accepts it.
there are steps to clone organs, save lives, destroy diseases.
this could be real, too.
but to clone a human being to duplicate a person's dna, replicating a similar dna?
dismissed.
i'm sorry
i appreciate the effort.
i don't want a rematch
hi.
hi.
you come here often?
this is my entry sentence.
that's a terrible, terrib
has it worked before?
better.
you want to go to a bar?
not tonight.
because you lost to larry?
it's not
to tell you the truth, i didn't want to win this time.
no, i want to be alone tonight.
alone with him.
not at all.
like you said, most people don't dance with an imaginary disco giant.
you're not cra
actually, i'm a little jealous.
when you're disappointed in the real world, you create something.
hey.
maybe the three of us can walk.
give it a chance.
if he doesn't, i'm still in.
well, i'll do that.
let's go.
who knew karaoke night would be the most pleasant party on the avenue avenue avenue avenue avenue avenue
you said it with p. diddy and kissinger?
i'm like, "islands in the stream.
the limo driver called and said... he said... he said...
disgrace the wedding of donald trump, multimillionaire?
sam, i've been in vegas for 00 minutes, but i haven't even played a hand blackjack yet.
your favorite table is ready.
ladies love a good karaoke singer, danny.
call me.
you think you can get any girl you want?
pick it up.
single duty, my friend.
she's here for the born-again virgins convention
girls who aren't technically virgins can change
the card counters hit two of the hotel this month, and the final shift report says there's a huge loss on the worljack tables.
there's a card counter downst
ed thinks he might be a card counter.
maybe we can continue this conversation later, like drinking.
patty, this is the third time, and you've been here
i didn't pay my rent and the reason why the landlord let me stay the land
listen, i'm sorry, but it's a business
if we pay for every shirt you screwed up, i'll sink.
all right, the gift boxes are packed and waiting to go to the guest room.
our florist brings the orchids and the other 0,000 left are arriving tomorrow.
however, if for some reason, a ship from amsterdam... for my tile tulips... come from amsterdam
mary, don't worry.
i'm sure everything will be fine.
you're the most comfortable bride i've
thanks for coming, galina.
that looks like a hundred thousand dresses.
hundred thousand dollars?
like i said, it's my first time.
it's a lot more than what we lost.
playing with a certain blanket doesn't mean it'
the numbers sit on a table and if there's rich people in it, right?
suspect woman, red hair, yellow dress, heading west.
thank you.
mr. sperreos, i'm from security.
always the question.
we haven't been married yet, and you've been out all night.
that's not good.
honey, i'm winning here.
tonight's over, and so are yours.
all right.
i told donald trump that our wedding would be a delicious chicken wing compared to the party at palm beach.
my team has been trying to make your wedding the most elegant and most elegant wedding this city's had in months
come on.
he was always the boss when he was a secretary.
why are you so desperate romantic?
you know, you can stop when your commission stops, and all i care about is that the montecito's still
let's go, people.
the guy with the tie, he told us he told us a dozen of them to lower the air conditioning.
he could mark 00's floor, make the game rich.
he's been sitting out there all night, barely playing.
and he doesn't keep his eyes off the blakjack tables
sperreos is happy to stand up and win the game just a minute before they're in a game.
you can't prove it.
even if i count the cards, it's not
that's technically true.
but we have a different sense of justice in vegas.
as before, i can catch a cheat and destroy a man in the desert.
i'm gonna be honest with you, i'm an old-fashion
please.
you're in the black book now that we have your picture.
if you step inside the montecito, i'll have you arrested specially.
you hear that?
hey, jack!
the man has broken us down to 000,000.
you know as well as i do counting's not illegal unless you have a machine in your hand, and he
at least we can have some fun with him.
it's not your story.
if someone is financing them and teaching them stuff, it's not the end of anything
i'm mike from last night, from mystique.
the man who isn't from phoenix.
there are other cities you're not actually.
des moines, for example.
it's amazing, but i have to go.
i'm boring and burning, aren't i
you said something that i finally joined in.
i think it should be you, because i'm usually pretty attractive
then what?
maybe i get a little nervous around you because you're so beautiful
my tongue is being held.
you know what we're gonna do?
what's that?
we're gonna sit down and we're gonna try to figure out
patty.
almost there.
they said i was okay?
it doesn't matter whether you're good or
i should fire you.
please.
thanks, thanks, thanks.
the tailor said he sent it back this morning, but there's no record of him getting there.
000 of our friends are coming to this wedding tomorrow, the head of government, industry leaders, oprah
would you like to tell oprah that the wedding was canceled and she came to las vegas for nothing?
if we don't, the montecito will be happy to get the same one.
that dress was a fashion masterpiece.
a dozen french tailor sewed it up with a handsh
there's no other like that.
you know how much that dress cost me?
that's a big problem, sam?
wait.
hey, danny, you asked me to look at the big blackjack winners.
the montecito has already spent millions on food, flowers, decor and entertainment.
... if the wedding doesn't happen as planned and lipworth refuses to give it away.
you think someone who actually stole it?
what's the street value on that thing?
why not the seamzi galina?
he took care of it when he heard the cost of the dress
mike.
hey.
let me know how it goes.
they used the same techniques that sperreos and his team used?
we catch one team, they send someone else in a few hours.
if we don't find out who's behind this, we might have to give them the safe key.
you better start talking right now, you bastard.
are you talking to sperreos?
you better take your hands, because the president's assault on me is more than i won from the montecito blackjack.
that was good.
did i take the dress?
i just want to know what happened.
i'll make the changes and i'll give the dress to the montecito messenger
there's a camera in the store?
i saw real diamonds in a costume for elton john.
compared to that, this dress is nothing.
galina protects herself.
you're free to go.
i'm helping you, patty.
god knows why i accepted this project?
i've always helped a baby bird, even if it's rabies.
then i'll get my tray.
this is christina, one of our best waitresses.
knees bent, bel back.
most of all, trust.
trust.
the tray is loaded with its weight, with martin
the hardest drink to carry.
he doesn't even look at the glasses.
he believes in his ability to do the right thing, and here he is.
zen team.
you're not much zen.
breathe with me, patty.
be like booze, patty.
you want me to sit here until mystique is opened?
thank god i don't want you standing here like a karate child.
call me sensei.
vic, you sent one of your staff to the store this morning to buy a dress.
yeah.
remember who you sent?
the tailor gave me a record, but i couldn't remember his face
bart, you went to the store to pick up a dress this morning.
no, i didn't go.
why not?
when i was about to leave, joey stopped me, and he wanted to go
scan joey's face and get his address for me.
thanks.
i'm sorry
the caviar sea caviar.
why would he cash his receipts?
did you hear anything about the dress?
yes, candy.
who's candy
i know it's not because i know it's forbidden here
do you know where we can find it?
danny mccoy, montecito surveillance and security.
how do you know nick sperreos?
cops don't scare me.
okay, wait, wait.
fine, fine.
that's enough
okay, i know him.
he's been here a couple of times with
these are his friends?
you know these people?
yeah, i guess so.
nick's a good kid.
he also asked me to cash in his chips.
i guess he thought i wouldn't be suspicious.
strippers are always rewarded with receipts.
look, it was good for five-minute work, and i didn't need to take off my clothes
why are you so interested?
because the sperreos and his friends were involved in some kind of a snowing operation.
i thought they were just some rich kids.
there's someone behind this, and i need to find out who it
any idea who's been training and financing these?
one time they came in with a big one.
yeah, they called him bucky.
mitch, did you scan joey's face?
fast forward.
somebody's paying him.
can you expand the picture?
no, but i can bring another angle.
you mean, lippworth's fiancée, lissy
we need to talk.
but you already know, don't you?
i know you paid to get rid of the parole dress.
what i don't understand, why?
it's the wedding, the details, the obstacity
listen.
it's a little weird if you want to leave.
that's the point.
i don't know if i want to leave.
i love him... but his life...
i mean, how many of the 000 coming from my friend?
people say it's a cinderella story.
i'm not cinderella.
i'm just a normal new jersey girl.
i may not know much, but considering my wedding is 00 times more expensive... than my family's house... my
that's not true
it is.
jared and i are very different.
i mean, what harm could it do?
how old do you think these kids are?
no more than 00.
danny, they're the yearbooks you
we'll see.
they're all in their mid-00s and they all have the math talent to count cards.
then they must have been taken from the math department and trained children.
and then i remember, how could i bring them to the knee?
given how the second team got here, i started with local colleges.
because you're a great guy and i'm interested in the less attractive ones.
maybe it's time for a
listen, mike, before this goes forward, there's something i need to say.
i've come to vegas for the virginity kogr of vegas.
renewed.
i've made mistakes with men in my past, and i wanted to start a clean slate, and i made a vow of chastity until i got married.
i mean, just because i gave my gift before doesn't make it any less valuable.
it's nice to be married to the
fine.
what's up
do you want to go back to school?
i want to go back and do a anthropology degree and go down to the rainforest and examine the native locals.
you're such an idiot.
what's up, ruben?
if you touch me, i'll call my lawyer right now.
call your lawyer?
what do you want?
where's bucky?
i don't know what you're talk
we have records of you robbing the montecito.
i don't think the students here like that kind of thing.
i can call the dean right now and tell his ass from here.
please don't tell my family.
hey.
hey.
did you ever hear of being reborn again?
so you always knew that?
i'm sorry, but i could get any girl i wanted to get rid of the bullshit that was
yeah, i set a trap with someone who's adorable and beautiful
you'd quit because he wouldn't sleep with you
hey, where are you going?
hey, mike.
i won't need you.
hey.
i was such an idiot.
i needed some time to process all this process.
do you think there's any place in your heart that could give me a second chance?
room service with the whipped cream, baby?
excuse me.
what was all that stuff about the precious gift
because to me, it's a new year's worth of gifts being thrown around.
look, i've been reborn five or six times.
and why isn't that me?
i tried to change.
so this is my fault?
i'm really sorry.
i took your advice.
i talked to jared and told him everything.
the wedding's
i said the wedding cancel, not the marriage.
does bucky train his team here?
hey, ruben, if it's funny, know your parents on the phone
bucky.
mr. buckner?
you know him?
my high school math teacher.
i'm the head of security at the montecito
yeah.
remember mrs. buckner?
last year, he escaped with coach kajoyan.
alimony's killing me.
night school debts.
but that's tax evasion.
you guys made a lot of money in a lot of casinos
i'm guessing some of that money wasn't reported to the tax office
keep these card counters away from the montecito, and we'll forget what happened.
before these kids leave, danny's gonna get their pictures and information.
what's the name of the dish on
oh, my god.
did you miss the flowers, the caviar and the oprah?
you know i don't care about those things.
all that matters is spending the rest of my boat with you.
delinda, i'm sorry
he has to listen to you, honey.
i'll make you a star.
i hope you noted somewhere.
careful, we're about to enter.
do i know you?
vinny's hanging out with your mom.
you really want to risk your life for a skirt and a geezer?
any sign of the professor?
i know six languages, why... why...
stein's gonna kill sara in the library.
somehow the speedster's disguised as stein and he's pushing the bottom of the
since when do you call him jax?
unfortunately, it won't take long
what did you do with steinin?
capone's men are taking over the ship.
you're here because i killed that stupid leader of jsa.
mr. rex tyler was it, wasn't
i don't want to spend the night here.
you're welcome, you drunken maniacs.
my job is better.
i'm in charge of the entire arena.
every night, 00,000 people come here to have fun, and i make sure they're having fun.
are you an actor?
yeah.
okay.
tell springsteen i'm the boss here.
don't say that.
anything he wants, say so.
have you seen a hot marketing director around here?
where have you been, man?
i have a meeting after the play.
how much time do we have?
0 minutes, 00 seconds.
0 minutes, i can do a lot of things in 00 seconds.
you're a funny girl.
i'm seeing other people.
i'm seeing other people, too.
happy birthday, ben.
how do you know?
morning.
all right.
happy birthday, ben.
you're a maintenance man, aren't
two years ago, you told me to tell you what to say, "evet. "
it's a little deceptive because you don't always ask yes or no questions.
forget that for now.
there'll be a circus here tonight, and if there's ice on the floor, those fire-breathing guys will be missing in front of their sticks
understand?
you told me not to run down the hall.
forget about the conversation we had two years ago.
oh, no, no, no.
he wants to talk.
that's not good, dude.
melt that ice, bobert.
benjamin!
come here.
quick.
crystal, before you get angry and start kicking everybody out, about that ice... that ice thing...
have you seen a little white pill with some spanish written on it?
i don't understand your level of concern.
or did i already take that pill?
hello.
yeah, i think you've already taken the pill.
i hate it when the circus gets here.
are they happy?
sad?
why are her pockets so big?
i'm sure you're talking about clowns.
morning, beautiful people.
morning, alonzo.
you're in an incredibly wonderful mood again.
every day is a beautiful day, my friend.
seriously, every day?
ben, that was the best day.
it was the day that i stopped caring for myself and started dedicated to the great people of san diego.
what are you doing?
i gotta get that pill out of my system.
what about today's charity event?
i invested a lot of money in illegal himalaya dog racing.
one of the dogs allegedly bit a himalayian guy.
anyway, i have a nightmare for himalaya.
can't we use that money to make it better?
okay, you're the owner, we'll do what you say.
did you see the oil painting?
don't forget to bring some kind of kid for
you know, black, white.
get an asian kid.
and we're gonna need a cup.
the asian kid's gonna give me a
you're right to clap, because these are good ideas.
benjamin, i almost forgot.
your... son?
have you had your new assistant?
thanks for that.
he set a guy on fire?
there was an investigation.
the evidence was inconclusive
i mean, yes.
he's good, though, right?
she set him on fire.
not very well.
a-a-a-al-al...
alonzo... al
what do you think it means when a girl sends a text saying " we need to talk "?
i'm in something similar.
i think you'll find a better chance of getting closer.
what could be better than that?
yeah, that's what i thought.
happy birthday, little man.
morning, heather.
morning.
and i'll tell you why i love it.
ben!
there's a man in your office, and he's
okay.
hi.
hi.
is there anyone else here besides you, someone more attractive than you?
no.
okay.
my name is ben
i'm roman.
so you're crystal's son.
that must be terrible for you.
yeah.
it certainly isn't
i wonder how they swam in the water.
okay.
i like mafia movies.
as a talent... as
this is a very exciting place.
we have political meetings, sports, rodeo, nightclubs, motorcycle races.
aren't you interested in any of this?
remember me?
i texted you three, and you didn't answer any of them.
i guess after five months of sleeping together, you'd have to learn that the unanswered texts drive me crazy.
look, i know we hate commitment.
" i accept that this is the affair. "
but this morning, i woke up at your house alone, which means you snuck out of the house.
when i paid for the coffee, i couldn't find my underwear until i left my wallet.
i got another coffee with this one, more... some more... coffee with
who's that?
and i like mafia movies.
and i really need to talk to you.
yes, it is, because it's a chance to get closer
what could be better than that?
this is a good business opportunity for you.
i'll see you at the christmas party.
i don't think that's what you meant
speak spanish.
i speak a little spanish.
yeah, i never understood what you said.
actually, your english is very good.
elephant!
crystal.
did you hear what i just said?
i didn't hear
let me see that talk.
i don't think you should open it, " you're a drunk, you can't say black
well, when should i say it?
you should never say that.
besides, i wouldn't sing the song either.
the ice is still there.
yeah, i know.
it doesn't seem sad to me.
it's your way of life.
you never wanted someone who was emotionally attached to you, wondering how and where you were, kissing you in the morning, waiting for you at night.
what's good about celebrating all this for your birthday?
but on your own birthday, you throw big parties.
i need to know i'll never be alone.
i'm not sure what to do now.
i'll go down, you hit the gas, go.
thanks.
black and white, white, and asian and- - and
don't sing that song.
i think we should go to dinner to celebrate my birthday.
that would be a good break for our relationship.
i think we should be together.
i'm a fan of finishing this relationship.
why did you let me speak first?
you first.
you'll be the first one to start all the conversation we
remember we said we met other people?
alonzo?
he's my best friend.
he's wanted to live with me for a while.
he wants a connection.
he wants a commitment?
this is a man we're talking about, is
what a man.
look, i... look
alonzo's an adult.
he cares about other people, too.
he's asking me questions about me, and he's paying attention to my answers.
what bothers me is that i thought we were the same.
when he says he's emotionally damaged emotionally,
how did he react when you told him?
he was already a very happy man.
that must have blown him up.
live with me.
we can do the commitment thing, too.
honey, i'm not the right woman for you.
you're so sweet, you're great for fun.
but no one can be the right person for you, because you only think about yourself.
what the hell was that?
i think it sounded right through my head.
i can't be a fryer.
i guess so.
you know what the worst thing is?
i don't think about anyone but myself.
it's really impossible for me to take care of other people
all of a sudden, i feel the need to make a connection, but i have no idea how to do it.
i'm in trouble, man.

i specifically asked for an asian kid.
there's an asian kid over there.
alonzo.
yeah.
yeah.
thank you.
they've stopped.
most of the time, people ask me why i love children so much.
maybe it's because i never had my own child.
i believe that our children's happiness is what we want to live in the happiness of the society, and it's made of people who live in this society.
they are our future, and their prosperity is our most important goal.
when you ask them to do things for you, they do it with enthusiasm.
or as i got older, i began to believe that the only life you live for is empty.
i wasn't really gonna say it, but i need to share a little song i wrote for this occasion.
aside from the musical portion of the musical, your speech was very touching.
sometimes it's really fun working with you.
i'm really happy right now.

what a wonderful moment.
i've never done this before.
what if i'm not ready
what if she's just acting that way because she wants me?
what if after she has me, what if she doesn't want
of course he'll want you.
you have everything.
everything.
okay?

in fact, we can make love one last time.
hey, crystal.
i really want to have sex with her.
i'll see what i can do.
can you give your attention to the poor kid you throw into the air?
fortunately, i convinced them to publish this photo.
more than a cop kick.
less than when you sank the mayor's boat.
great.
cool.
while i got you,
i want you to sit down with someone who's childlike cheer and faithful, who will be an incredibly useful asset at the sunlight center.

dee, we're putting you in the position of charlie's, but are we dealing with arrogance and questions?

do i have to know the guy when he put a spaghetti on his face
i'll buy one for the guy i don't know behind my back.
i told you why.
'cause i think you've been pretty long the last time
i couldn't because charlie put the fucking emergency lunch in half.
i don't want to run into something you've encountered.
as i told that one a few minutes ago, our fish are gone.
we'll all get a plate of hot pipe spaghetti instead

i just didn't see you had a plan to win.
yeah, you gave us free beer, and then you said " vote for your car " in it.
we're very lucky that everyone has retreated
i'm not really doing anything about sports anymore.
god, it feels like a different life.
i need to hit something with a stick for a beer.
okay, brawlers, i want to make a pre-game toast.
maybe we'll remember that winning isn't everything, but we have a keg beer!
wait.
everyone, this is riley and my daughter emma.
i mean, wheeler's leading with unplanned pregnancy,
hey, tuck, why don't you give something to the new

that's what i know.
you're going out with mom?
i was going to talk to myself, but bonnie said she could handle it.
i took care of it, but i didn't
you can't say you take it well.
i mean, when your mom's out on a date with coach, they can have a pillow talk in bed.
if i call the girl you made happy hours ago, we'd be happy to have your voice cut.
we could have more babies.
i'm going to go to practice until my brain is exhausted.
he's throwing his food around, i think he does it well.
the father's
mom's coming soon, can you take the equipment downstairs to the field for me?
it's more than my heavy, heavy-duty
you don't care about the cups on the shelf,
sounds like i missed the game.
you missed another little thing.
the children voted riley captain.
i was just telling you that you lost it.
i was feeding my baby and you took my team away.
i was wearing the glove... and then everyone started screaming.
" you're amazing! "
because i hear it's amazing.
maybe if you're in my place, you'll do some good things i haven't done
because i don't care what the others say.
" i'm so excited by your face, suckers! "
we only had some italian food.
that's why i'm trying to stop you.
honey, i don't think we should talk about these parts, these are things about my personal life.
okay, honey, i know you don't want to hear this, but i'm a woman and i have needs.
when i won't even open my mouth.
he said " put it on. "
i don't want anyone to cancel their plans.
thank you, danny.
not yet, but it will be resolved.
honey, are you okay?
i tried as soon as i could.
with this, you're 00 minutes away.
i didn't call anyone who could take care of emma.
the dentist said i should see you right away.
and remember, don't bring home the giant toothbrush.
it's for the bathroom key.
i'm sorry about your date with hank.
i shouldn't even talk to you right now.
please tell me that emma's in the car outside the park.
hank canceled something, i don't know the details.
but if mom asks, they hid me here.
you care about other people's happiness.
to make sure he doesn't and hope he doesn't
dude, i need you to come back.
you think she stopped being rigantor?
he's gonna make sure my little planets whisper in my head?

mom, i'm home.
what are you doing here?
i'm sure it's my robe.
hank, you ready for round two?
danny, there's nothing going on here

yeah, she hates it.
because we're not watching the same play here.
it's actually full of vodka.
we're gonna drink this and we're gon
we have a chance to make a clean shot.
sit down, wheeler, next to the other ladies
what about riley?
okay, tuck, your turn.
do it again, don't miss and go out of the field
when i told riley something he shouldn't have heard before, she ate my crayon paint.
i can't forget you're still eating brown.
don't worry, i'll get your back, okay?
hey, teammates.
don't you look cute today?
is that my phone?
it's about the play.
thank god.
i was worried i couldn't bring you back.
i know what you're thinking, but you gotta do something other than check the team.
like i'm doing right now?
i want you to be more serious at the games.
i'm having a hard time putting you on the squad with the others.
to tell you the truth, i must kick you off the team.
but i can't
i'm really gonna miss you when i don't move you.
thank you.

winning is fun for you.
oh, my god, i love it!
but what will it get me?
the way the room is full of cups and no one's sharing that with me?
looks like danny figured it out
yeah, none of us are your brother.
yeah, i think i've heard that a couple or a thousand times.
right.
right.
i was thinking about a real change for the win.
i've never tried it before.
yeah, i think you should figure out how to uncover the real brawlers without me.
ben, nobody wants me.
go brawlers!

do the wheeler, do the wheeler's... do the wheel
what's riley doing?
they call him wheeler.
we'll use you to monitor it from the inside.
why is patty interested in this murder?
i suggest mr. purcell not answer any more questions.
you were at home alone with your wife's body.
there's no sign of forced entry.
patty, i saw the guy who did this.
our firm was hired to do toxicological research on a chemical compound.
these companies are worth hundreds of billion dollars.
michael, this is daniel purcell.
we have a protection problem.
he's the chief consultant of the world's
did you tell anyone about us?
the acid rains from the coal coal burner power plant are doubling the bullets levels up to 00 times the nation's average.
_
so they've had more than 000 cases in the last three years?
why didn't he bribe the
i wonder the same thing, but i don't know how patty could have known that we were setting tom up.
what have you guys found on purcell?
we have to make sure we're still in the dark, so that we can move forward.
it's okay with me.
ellen, i know it's disappointing, but you have to back off.
we'll all fall back.
it might help me.
i have no experience in criminal law.
we must have chased him out before he found time to steal something.
it was dark the first time.
you know, last night, i was wondering if someone mistook the house.
isn't it your job to find this, detective?
let's see if there's anything in the photos that will refresh your
mr. purcell didn't come here to be harassed.
he always did.
it's a very important development, mr. purcell
if you find the ring, you'll find my wife's killer
mr. purcell, i believe you.
because the person who killed christine is still out there somewhere, and you have absolutely no advantage over it.
you can't use them against me.
don't answer that.
i could swear he pretended to be arrested.
one incident three years ago is not probable cause.
no, but it's like he's lying about everything.
i mean, it's been broken into your house twice, and there's
wasn't the contaminant doing any damage to health?
we've talked on the phone a couple of times, but i don't think he's gonna
he wants to introduce me to the guy he's with
if there's one thing we need to know, patty will tell us when she's ready.
whatever you've gotten the company into, it's better if nothing comes out of the stolen documents.
if you're wondering what happened to christine purcell, look at the grieving widow.
my only job is to protect mr. kendrick, and if you've done anything to expose him or ultima national resources... or ultima national resources... or ultima national resources... or
everything okay in new york?
daniel purcell, i'm meeting with patty hewes.
do you have reason to believe ultima national resources was involved in the murder of your wife?
i've observed a lot of farm animals have died recently.
00 years ago, he used daniel purcell as an expert witness and won a case.
then why was the report on ibc global's report that 000 million was acceptable?
daniel purcell was a brilliant man, but when he faced patty, he collapsed.
no, this is just another big conspiracy for you to uncover.
as soon as i tell you what i know about ultima national, you put me aside.
whatever she tells you, you can't trust her.
i don't know who killed your wife, but you're gonna get blamed for
and they worked together before that purcell ibc global.
nine months after the testimony of up purcell, michael was born.
just the two of
we'll encounter unexpected elements.
we will neutralise them with a major attack.
on three.
one, two, three.
shoot them!
detective stark?
excuse me.
yeah.
that guy over there.
and you pulled over on the 00th?
am i under oath?
i'd appreciate it if you'd stop asking that
was mr. young, the one you pulled over on the 00th?
i can't tell if you don't say it again.
what?
you know what this is, you son of a bitch?
it wasn't a real bomb
" there's no way, no criminal
not legally, detective.
even the threat to the bomb is a clear physical threat.
it's a terrible construction.
i think the terrible thing is your shirt.
your honor, we demand denial of the case.
liz, i don't know what to say.
he's your partner, jack.
that's not reason enough, jack.
we've been trying to catch wayne young for years.
i'm liz,
jack, what are you gonna say?
i need to be alone.
you want some chips?
no, i don't want chips, dan.
i think they put a spice in it.
it feels better.
you've ruined the case... dan
but it's a state case
you mean your ex-boyfriend's case?
they're finishing up the investigation.
that means no more department proceeds.
department stock?
and fight crime with sticks?
we need financial resources for a research investigation.
you know what?
good luck to you.
you'll see.
good day to you all.
see you in hell.
here it is.
i thought you might remember that.
you're absolutely right.
hey, do you have any of the nicotine gum with
i can't imagine myself without them
because i left those cancer sticks.
that's it.
all right, we gotta do some errands.
first, i need to get myself a shotgun.
you got it wrong!
there's a misunderstanding!
please!
i made a deal while you were in jail.
that goes for both of us.
what kind of deal?
heroin.
near south america.
i put it in one of our trucks.
i have a client.
and it's only the beginning
if he does business, we bring more heroin.
wayne, we're both close!
you meet the man and we'll make a delivery.
what about the cops?
they can't come after you!
the cops can't do anything!
rough day?
yeah.
is this about the girl or business?
you're gonna need a second donut.
hey, dan.
what's up?
of course i do.
i'll bring this up to liz in the morning.
i'll call you back.
don't move!
okay.
okay.
don't move!
i'm not moving!
why are you attacking me?
you're harming the sacred bond.
i have three warrants on me.
being in contact with the cops isn't the first thing
that's what i want to talk to you about.
how would you feel if the arrest warrant was lifted?
" which is when he says... " the gl
"julius, you don't have to go to jail. " lift?
because it seems to me.
i'm all yours, man.
you can do whatever you want.
i want information about wayne young.
i know that.
i know wayne young.
how do you like it
all i want is a piece of paper, pen, and writing... all i want
do it.
there's a place out of oakwood, okay?
that's it.
does that make us good?
we're gonna put him in jail
fine.
okay.
because i want to hug you.
you can hug me.
all right.
thanks a lot, man.
okay.
okay.
what can i do for you, jack?
i was talking to dan... about dan
it means everything is by the book... according to the book,
he's not exactly his partner's
actually, that's why i can send him home.
don't worry about it
just give me information to resist wayne.
okay.
i'll see you in the office.
wayne was working in a garage in east dallas.
she works for a company like shell.
but what are we going to arrest him for?
we'll figure something out when we get there.
no, dan.
" we're investigating an x-ray
yeah, that'll work.
by the way...
how did you find out where wayne was working?
am i still under oath?
this is the address.
hello!
that's weird
what did you say we go in and check out the truck?
what about this?
unauthorized entry?
they really should know that security sucks.
besides, it's best if nobody comes in here without a helmet
you mean us?
hey, ours is breach.
it goes after we don't spend more than $ 0.00
that's why i'm
it's like a
it pisses you off, but it doesn't do anything to calm you down
everything gets worse.
what the hell is this place?
what are they doing here?
we don't know... we
i have to call liz.
just... just
dan, what are you doing?
dan, we can't be here.
what you do is illegal, dan?
okay?
this truck is full of boxes.
yeah.
boxes full of crime.

i can feel the whining in my memory!
another excuse for the report.
listen, dan.
we got off on a bad start here, okay?
did you hear anything?
start the car.
i'll close the back.
dan, this is an illegal investigation, okay?

you just described 00,000 square miles.
god damn!
then break the door so we can jump out.

physics, dan.
it's suicide.
if you jump fast enough, there's no suicide, man.

good idea, dan.
right in front of you
look!

i'm waiting for you to say " things. "
let's go!
get in the car!

come on.
come on!
hang on.

that's exactly what i wanted it to be.
that's what scared me.

register your weapon!
what was all this?
embrace.
i'm a hugger.
it was like a walnut trunk on number 00.
anyway, he ran up here... and he ran over...
no sign of paco.
what about heroin?
there's no sign of that
looks like he got away with it, too.
he doesn't have anybody
and wayne young will testify against paco.
and i'm sure he'll say exactly... and
" and drag the flak along to hell with me. "
well, that'll do.
yeah, but you know what's not gonna work?
i wasn't part of anything like that in my mind.
it just happened.
you came all this way because you were worried about me?
no.
i came all this way to see wayne young under arrest.
i'm so sorry, jack.
well, i stole a sports car and set the truck on fire.

hunters here spend their lives searching for rare and difficult hunters.
000 tons of weight is the greatest animal that ever lived by 000 meters long.
despite their enormous size blue whales are the most aerodynamic and energy-minded in all swimming animals.
they can travel over a hundred miles a day for weeks a day.
it takes a lot of effort to open your enormous mouth, so it only takes when you see a lot of rich, dense crickets.
there's usually a rare opportunity of feeding here.
when they're all done, the hunters must remain searching for the

trusting his perfect camouflage, he's hiding in moss.
the open oceans are so vast that some hunters can only find enough prey by searching for a team.
dolphins live in highly sophisticated social groups.
working together they can cover a wide area of the ocean.
small groups sometimes come together, which builds 0,000 super-dups.
they're using some kind of geekoquatch to find their prey.
but these little fish spend most of their time in the deep ocean, where dolphins can't reach.
they're just hunts when they come up to the surface just to feed.
when they find a lot of big, the dolphins use their radar for another purpose.
as the dolphins feed, they approach the pack to keep their prey from escaping back to safety again.
as down below, the food is much scarcer on the surface, so the hunters must do everything they can to save their precious energy.
most are dragged only by watching the tentacles filled with deadly needles.
others, surprisingly, along with the hairs of the breeze's spatter, are slow to the

the open ocean may be a wide blue desert, but like any desert, there are savages,

both sharks are the same species as galapagos, and they are traveling between the other scouts of the sea of the vast ocean of the great ocean.
no one knows exactly why they've been collecting so many, but some of them are certainly coming to look for food.
if these little fish stay close to the mercury, sharks can't reach them.
as long as they keep the silver fish close to the ocean floor, they can throw away predators from their heads.
there's never an easy meal in the open
here, the waters that were exposed to the storm creates nutrients that carried the nutritional meals into the surface, creating isolated areas of
black eyebrow albatross are the same size as frigate birds, but three times as heavy, and so they need a totally different flying style.
albatross has the longest wingspan of any bird, and that enables them to exploit the power of the southern ocean winds.
first, they glide against the wind, use its energy to gain heights.
then they'd turn around, and they'd get faster by
they often spend weeks at sea searching for prey without ever returning to land.
because the winds are so powerful here, the albatrosses can't afford the weight of oil that makes their feathers waterproof.
they can duck ducks up to a mile, so they rely on the churning of the southern ocean to bring their prey up into range.
like all birds, albatross have to lay eggs on the land as the snow, but there are very few available islands in the south coast of atlas, they are very crowded
he comes here every year to raise nearly half a million albatross cubs.
adults share parenting duties to feed their babies in a few days.
once the feeding process is over, it's time to head out
the albatrosses are so heavy, they can only air from places where the wind is strong enough.
from the weather, it may look like the ocean's unique, but under the surface, there's always the strong tide of the tide
these details are more effective than any other force, to determine the existence here.
all organisms drift in the ocean are attached to these flow.
they come together to feed on fresh planktones, where the swimmingly little plant and animals and the current brings them.
the feathers in their legs are slowing down their foreheads, and then with a few tail shots, they're still swimming up and down.
the current carrying these traveling crabs see the freeway function for the ocean's large predators.
with perfect aerodynodynamics, they can bring the longest distances with minimum effort.
these hunters are a shuttlecraft between the oceans where their prey often gathers.
each predator has an extraordinary sense of smell that can detect any indistinct trace of the prey left behind by the prey
great fishers are attracted to the charm of plankton bounty.

their self-defense depends on the threshold.
when the attack comes, the sardines move like a single body.
every fish is able to adapt to the movement next to the one next to you right away, and the entire pack moves as a
even when more sea lions arrive, they don't seem to break the sardines' coordinated defenses.
the sea lions have to separate a herd of this size into smaller controlable groups.
but with so little predators, the fish still have the advantage.
all the sea lions can do is keep the sardines on the surface and wait for the others to join them.
the tunnels attack from below, so they cut off the sardines' way into deep water.
the more the fish squeeze the pure, the more their strategy makes it easier for the hunters.
tonnes of sardines run out in less than an hour.
the predators go on their own path and disappear into the wild blue.
this blue whale is still searching for food to satisfy its endless hunger.
because it's so big, it's gotta find an average of

he's heading for the hunt by targeting the most dense part of the whale
it takes too much effort to swim with a fully expanded throat, and the whale fits.
the whale uses its tongue to throw it out of its mouth, while the crackers form on the chin.
but it takes time to sink so much water.
blue whales may not be as agile as other hunters, but they don't have to.
no other hunters are more qualified to resign from the distracted riches that the open oceans provide.
the blue whale is the greatest hunter of all the oceans in
the open oceans created a lot of hardships to the "wave
it became a two-year mission to achieve that.
the team worked with john calambokidis, the world's most important blue whale expert, john cal
john got vital information from these harmless labels.
part of this investigation and part of the reason that we're working with filmmakers is that it gives us a unique chance to get scientific data.
so we're doing this under our research permit to get an insight into what they're doing underwater, how they swim, how they feed.
the team's success will depend on good water visibility.
it's too tired and the whale is literally disappearing in darkness.

then david should go in the water and hope the whale gets close enough to get on the record.

after weeks of effort, all the elements finally come together, giving david the chance of his life.
i've been overwhelmed, it's taken
i mean, it was so big, it was like a freight train.
the blue whales underwater are rare, so it's a tremendous accomplishment to simply take on a swimming whale.
this series is all about hunting, so it's a good shot, but we've got to get the footage of the blue whale to complete the episode.
and we're gonna have to wait for the criteria to come to the

the crew's hit a promising embrace but it's a pretty unpleasant source.
look at those birds in the water!
we'll go and have a look.
look at that!

david saw him, turned the camera.
he took a turn, went up and bought a huge bite.
they're called blue whale because they see them underwater, shiny cobalt blue and cobalt blue, they come out of the blue of the ocean.
i was upstairs trying to get another image of the krils, and, honestly, his mouth has been revealed once again.
it was probably less than ten minutes, but it was doubtless, no questions, and it was the most amazing thing i've ever seen.
it's something i'll never forget, to share the water with a blue whale and come to the eye.
and the reverse turn.
yeah, that's a unique angle we'll never see.
with this close cooperation, the team have filming blue whales have never been seen before, and finally, to reveal the secret life of the ocean's greatest hunter.

i don't believe you.
i've seen you dance!
right.
he lives in broken hill.
very good.
and let's say i got in trouble.
i don't know, probably
you said you were close.
so you're saying he answers, right?
brothers help their brothers?
maybe until we call him.
when the room calls another number, which means she didn't know it was me.
now you know everything.
right or wrong?
i'd say it was wrong, but...
see, you've learned nothing.
my brother and i are very close.
i have one question left.
question 00.
ask him.
why did you tell everyone i was dressed in the wrong dressing room?
you knew it was by mistake.
why would i even bother?
i don't believe you're still lying about it.
i know you did it.
you know, i wasn't the only man there.
have you thought about that?
tara, what were you thinking?
do you think...?
do you think it says 0-0 or 00?
two and four hours.
you want to know why i'm bad against tara?
because you three are so stupid!
i need to talk to you.

you've been laughing behind me all this time, haven't
excuse me?
during the audition week... you told everyone i was in the wrong locker room.
that was you, wasn't it
come on, admit it was a funny thing.
and leaving me alone at the beach?
it's fun, isn't
but you weren't with us.
not responding to my pros and cons list?
i didn't realize i had to answer.
of course you were supposed to.
the whole school is laughing at me because of
why would it be because of me?
look, if you want to hear the truth, i'm ashamed of that list.
i mean, we've only talked to you three or four times, right?
and you go write everything you feel and send it to the whole school.
i don't even know you.
tara? t
tara? t
he can't talk to you.
yes, he can.
i thought you were sick of girls coming to you after ethan.

because i don't believe he's a real doctor.
he was wearing a tight trousers with a big, silver belt buckle.
he can't be more than 00 years
they're graduating from medical school nowadays.
john!
god, it's so good to see you.
you came and saw your mother first, didn't you?
yeah.
how was she looking at you, john, tell me the truth
like my mother.
it was like he was gonna drag his iv bottles out of there.
i mean, it was just gas pains.
i'm sure that's what he told
and the will?
like a half-year-old woman.
you look very modern.
where do i put your bags, sir?
oh, here's a trouble.
thanks a lot.
you don't put a suitcase in the living room.
you know the rules.
i'm putting them in your old bedroom.
the living room is still off limits?
you're kidding.
this place looks just like the smithson's.
dad's out there, huh
yeah, in the green house.
what's going on there?
mario said he took it very hard.
he's scared, john.
he's really, really scared.
i'm not sure he understands what's going on.
what do you mean?
she saw him, didn't she?
i didn't want to drag him there.
i told him you weren't allowed visitors, and he just seems to understand that.
hey, dad.
hello, john.
good to see you.
you look good.
good to see you too.
i'll stay here for a few days
did you hear what happened to your mom?
how is he?
fine.
fine.
he told me to say hello and he said he'd be home soon.
something's wrong with your body, isn't it?
something like that.
the furnace doesn't work well in your old room, you know.
you should use a second blanket.
okay.
as long as you're here, the most important thing in your envelope is to make everything go
your mother has a calendar, and her life is a really long routine.
and a sugar.
they cut coupons in the morning, they make a shopping list.
it's very important
i wrote you a list of pills.
when did he get so bad?
i've only seen him for a year.
no, you're wrong.
what are you saying?
i was here for christmas.
annie, i need to know that.
okay, i saw him two years ago.
a lot happens in two years.
why didn't you tell me?
i tried to get him to us, but he wasn't comfort
we both work all day long.
but here he has his garden and his green house.
he knows the environment.
i can only stay here for a few days.
what do we do next?
can't you stay longer?
i have to go to boston.
no way.
we need to bring someone home.
but we have to find the right person.
my father is old, john.
yeah.
dad, let's just hit the head, huh?
johnny.
i can't find my pajamas.
i don't know where your mother put them.
here.
why don't you put them on, dad
i will.
are you okay?
i miss your mother.
he'll get what he needs.
good rest.
he'll be home soon.
night.
night.
keep the hall lights on.
okay.
sleep well.
i don't eat more than this in the morning,
it was good, though.
thanks, dad.
you do a lot of cooking at home, don't
not really.
i've been eating out since sara and i got divorced.
yeah, she was a nice girl.
still is.
how's billy?
he's in santa cruz now.
freshman in college.
he came to visit once.
so you've seen him more than i've ever seen.
look at this, johnnie.
it's double coupon day at the ralphs.
two cans of tuna at $ 0.00.
amazing.
how much is that tuna fish in new york?
it's not $ 0.00.
no, i disagree.
no way.
listen, dad, i want to talk to you for a minute about mom.
there's something you need to understand.
my mother is sick.
it's not cancer, is it
no, no, it's not cancer.
it kills cancer, you know.
your uncle ben had five operations.
nothing has been done to him.
i'm telling you, if you're gonna get cancer, you're gonna have to
look, it's not cancer.
a heart attack.
is she gonna be okay
yeah, he'll be fine.
but it won't work as hard as it used
he'll have to learn to take it easy, and you have to help him with that.
i always tell him that you work too hard.
johnny, he works hard.
you need to learn a few things you can do at home.
look, my mother has convinced you that no one else can look at you except her.
we're gonna try to fix this wrong with him.
i got it, johnny.
i'm gonna learn how to do all this.
you'll see.
we're gonna make fun of him
okay, dad, the thing we have to do is, let's
" out the whites of the whites,
that way, the dark ingredients don't get involved in white
understood.
i think that's what your mother would do.
now we know we're on the right track.
okay, let's start with the colors, shall we?
they're col
colored.
white, colourful, colorful.
white.
colored.
colored.
and this?
him?
he's white
okay, it's col
dad, he must be one of them.
i think we should call your mom.
i'm gonna make a fertilizer here.
okay.
what do you think we have?
"ee, normal.
i'm trying "normal. "
what kind of water should we use?
" there's nothing but cold-blooded, warm-up, warm-up, warm-up. "
oh, what the hell is this?
warm-up.
i think he was white.
it'll be ready for thursday.
yeah.
what's the easiest way to get to the market from here,
i don't know these streets very well, john.
your mother will take us where we need to go.
you never drive?
never?
i can't
my driver's license expired a few years ago.
you didn't get another driver's license?
well, they asked me to pass a trial test because of my age.
you failed the test?
i didn't take the test.
i was afraid i couldn't pass.
what are you saying?
you used a great car.
johnny's a good driver who knows when he can't drive well, that's all.
i couldn't remember what you liked, so i took a lecture from everything.
great.
well... fine...
these are beautiful.
i want to see your mother, johnny.
i don't think that's a good idea right now, dad
i mean, my mom's fine, but they wouldn't want to have any visitor.
i'm her husband.
i need to see him.
that's not true
excellent.
he made me breakfast this morning.
no, i'm not serious.
i don't know, it's a box of
yeah.
everything's fine.
okay, mr.-bay
okay, dad
annie's meeting the guys at the
he thinks they'll let you see him in a day or two.
good.
yeah.
what? what?
i can do the dishes.
i coded these cards in color.
there's a different set of cards here on a day's
for example, now, the pink ones are for washing dishes.
go ahead, take a look and see what his number is.
number one.
" fill the flavour with water. "
okay.
number two?
"yua put some soap plug on the so
okay.
" leaves messages in the water with water. "
i've prepared these for you to work on your own
that's great, johnny.
if i follow these cards, there's no reason for me to make a mistake.
i'll watch these.
i'll show you how to burn the stove, dad.
no, on the other hand, the stove is now off limits.
no january.
and stay away from that blender blender..... and
no flapping.
i think i should work with it.
your mother wouldn't want me to wear this.
i look so rude.
like johnny cash.
you don't think that when you wear this, do you?
no, dad, i don't think
don't take your guns to town, son.
leave those guns at home.
bang, bang.
" fill the flavour.
the floor is professionally waxed, dad.
you can see yourself in the ground.
there's no sign of any cila hugs.
you know what i think?
i think we should reward ourselves.
what do you mean?
let's go out and have a good time.
what do you say?
okay.
okay.
what do you and mom do here for fun?
it's 00th. "

we will.
thanks.

he's dead

well, it's good to see you again.
it's been a while.
a long time.
nice to meet you.
they're like fresh air.
i know your bingo, too.
you haven't been here long, have you, dad
when was the last time you played here?
it's been three
you're kidding.
why did you stop coming?
i don't
we used to have so much fun with your mother here, more than anyone here, but...
we don't do what we love anymore.
i don't know why.
i think you should remember the fun things and start doing them again.
that's a good idea.
john, i'm gonna write this
i'm gonna make a list of fun things.
yes, sir.
bingo.
what?
i think you did bingo.
hey, i got bingo!
i was worried about you, john.
i'm afraid you're gonna be
we should take a look at this.
we can win, and we can get the regular gain.
i know a computer guy in new york, let me consult him....
great with numbers.
it'll produce a system for us.
you'll see.
we're gonna beat these guys, d
i'm sorry, i didn't mean to leave you so late.
it's like christmas night.
the only thing missing here is guy lombardo.
he's dead
surprised hal mccarthy didn't mention it.
big day tomorrow.
better lie down.
night, john.
night, dad.
"b-0. "
and then.
there they are, dad.
hey, dad.
you're kidding me.
ready to see him, dad?
i can't believe my dad looks so good.
is that what you think?
thanks to you, john.
thanks to him, i'm fine.
that was fun.
listen, i hired someone to take care of the house.
it'll be a day or two
i can stay home until mom gets home.
really?
yeah, it doesn't matter
hey, bette.
are you okay?
mm-hmm.
are you taking your blood pressure pills?
are you eating?
yeah, i'm fine, bette.
i can make my own bed now.
and washing dishes.
john's teaching me to cook.
she's like a real wife.
just keep him alive until i get back.
thanks for your rendezvous.
mom looks good, doesn't she?
yeah, great.
i can't go anywhere without my tubes.
i meant your face color, mom.
my color?
what are you, a decorator?
don't call me " grandma. "
do i call you son?
don't be so nice to my mother, mario
you're gonna kill him
why are you cooking?
there was food in the fridge.
i told you.
we just wanted some changes, that's all.
we had salmon last night.
the night before, we had'coq au vin.
your father doesn't like foreign food.
it's just red wine chicken.
he shouldn't drink red wine.
mom, it was this much.
i don't want him becoming an alcoholic while i'm
nobody who eats ccoq au vin is an alcoholic.
calm down, bette.
don't worry about everything.
just focus on getting better and don't worry about me.
you sure you want to come, dad?
it's gonna be a
no, i'll come.
good for me.
i could buy you a lunch here, watch a movie.
i'll sit down, read a magazine.
i'll be fine.
okay.
i'd like to see john tremont, vic walton, please.
he's waiting for you.
dad, are you gonna be comfortable here with all your repairs?
sure, no one's gonna drop anything on me.
john, good to see you.
i apologize for the confusion
good to see you too, vic.
this is my father, jake tremont.
dad, this is vic walton.
nice to meet you, mr. tremont.
me too.
we'll be here in an hour?
like i said.
okay, well, take care, dad.
wait a minute.
we can't leave your father here.
come on, mr. tremont, why don't you come and sit with us inside?
i think that i-
ralph, we've given you every benefit of the privileges, and now our projections are 00 % less than yours.
how can you be so confident?
you-you've never followed anything like this before.
and if you're wrong, we'll be the laughing stock of the industry and we'll never be able to do business with you again
forget about running a canned factory.
he loses money every minute he's left open, but the land he's on is worth at least
how can you be so sure about 00 million dollars?
we can leave it to $ 00 million to serve some.
do you have any backup information?
can i go back to the subject now?
the land's real value is we have no problem with all the shipping business around $ 00 million.
they can take over all the general expenses, but the plan we have shows that we need to eliminate 00 % of the administrative staff in a few months.
isn't it enough just to sell
that way the accounting records can be resolved.
if this goes well, it won't be necessary.
i don't think they're focusing on
we can change that.
the other thing is the food wholesale sales, the best sector in the case.
now, our cash flowing plans in our department seem jumpy, but it's not satisfactory.
all things considered, we don't have a problem getting a loan out of the banks.
yeah, that looks good.
johnny, what's going on there?
well, we're gonna buy a salmon cannery, dad.
i didn't know you knew about something like that.
actually, i don't know.
the guy who came to us for the money doesn't know
we're just gonna buy the company, and then we're gonna put an
is that your job?
you buy companies, then close them off?
my work is a little complicated, dad.
we're getting this canned factory in this case.
then the company sucks.
this third generation is taking over, it's terrible for production.
but they have a small front-runner company, and that's what it's all
the factory is built on a valuable property near the sea.
so we buy the factory, close it down, then we sell the land.
and you never thought to run these companies?
there's no money in that, dad
the world has changed, johnny.
you can't believe how the world has changed.
when you were a little kid, you used to go to work at lockheed with me, remember?
i used to tear those nuts apart and touch them.
they'd pay 00 cents a day, and i'd buy some ham-and-cheese sandwic
when you grew up, you'd say you wanted to work there, one by one.
but now your job is to buy and then turn it off.
did you hear anything about those lockheed men, dad?
rick malinson?
tommy williams? tom
they all moved away.
to the valley, the palm springs... the valley... the
there was no one there to say goodbye to me
the next morning, i didn't have anyone doing the job i did in the
the world is split into two groups
brushes and bosses.
i don't know, dad, i
it's all right, johnny.
there's nothing wrong here.
i'm a worker, that's all.
but you're different.
you like to be in control.
you like responsibility.
you're a boss.
mom?
what do you think?
okay, dad.
" if you hit a parked vehicle and can't find the owner of the vehicle... "
why are you doing this?
i've already passed the written test.
i know, but you may not be too careful.
most of the samples here could be on the driving test.
i want to get you ready for this.
very good.
thank you.
we've come this far.
i don't want to see anything go wrong now.
they want us to pull over here.
go.
slow down, slow down, not so fast.
okay, stop.
there he is.
jake tremont?
it's actually jake tremont.
i'm his son, john.
i guess you didn't need to know that, but you heard me.
you can't sit here during the test, sir.
oh, i'm sorry.
oh, you can't stay in the car.
what are you talking about?
that's my dad.
that's the rules
as long as you're sitting in the car, i'm not gonna
you get out now, or your father is a failure on the test.
everything ok?
you'll be fine if you do
i was leaving your car parked on the way out of your
john?
i'm leaving
i'll check the bikes and other vehicles
yes!
when you're waiting for a left turn, first priority to cars coming out of the denial
make sure all the dangerous means pass.
yes!
oh, look who's here.
hey, dad
hey, billy.
hey...
grandma was sick.
i ran right over.
i thought you might need me, grandpa.
don't even think about helping grandpa.
when was the last time you had dinner?
why are you americans so obsessed with food?
you know, when in rome... when in rome...
what were you doing in mexico?
spring break.
a few of my friends are there
dad, you say that every time we see each other.
and i haven't grown up in two years
how's your mom
fine.
third year in law and top of class.
it's embarrassing if your mother's taking notes more than you, but we're working.
send my love.
how are you?
sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
if i know you, you're winning more than you've lost.
if you're done, you can wax with a piece of cake.
he looks so good.
what's going on?
well, we're spending a lot of time together.
good time, huh?
they say it's very good for parents and children.
maybe you and i should spend more time together.
this place looks great, grandpa.
you put too much on
you look good.
i'm gonna name that after you, bill.
butter?
want some butter, honey?
i want to make a toast.
aha.
a lot has happened in the last two weeks.
_
we had them all together as a team.
it's time for thanksg
that was great, mario.
that's my usual speech.
in fact, i just wanted to say how nice to see our family together and happy together.
my chicken's getting cold.
it's over
very good.
i'm making a toast too.
hmm.
well, dad.
to my lovely bride.
your daughter-in-
have you had any today, jake?
before you came, mother, we had a couple of glasses of c'coq au vin.
to my beloved bride
bette, welcome back to our family, where you belong.
it's so good to be
listen, listen.
nice talk, dad.
it's nice to have everybody here
and i don't remember the last time we were together with john billy.
billy looks good.
i like that earring.
should i?
i've got a pin that fits him if you want.
oh, leave her alone, mom.
looks great.
i bet the girls are gonna jump on you.
don't worry about me.
it's not embarrassing.
the dorms are boys.
is that true?
yeah, we're in our dorm, and it's
fortunately, it wasn't like that in our
if that's the case, i wouldn'
like you've been a student to me.
mario was a great student, mom.
he graduated from physics.
he didn't even read a book, and the licking
yeah, well, all the good students were at the same time reading a book with me, and they were done with it.
but john was a good student.
thanks, mommy.
we went out of the library every friday, every friday.
we'd get four books.
you'd read them, we'd give them back, we'd get three new books
you did more than that.
and how did it work?
were the girls on the other floor?
somebody shut this guy up.
i'm just happy
let's make it easy for grandma and grandpa while you're here.
of course, you're so used to hearing it, you can't believe it's true.
believe me, i do.
my fillings are still pushing.
i'm sorry.
so when do you have to go back to school?
i'm not going back to school.
i'm thinking of hanging out in mexico for a while.
what's the joke about mexico?
all mexicans try to come here.
did you know that?
there's a couple of kids from school
they have very similar aspects.
that's, uh, that'
yeah, it's fun, but believe it or not, you're gonna want to work one day, bill.
lying on the coast of mexico isn't gonna do you any
if you don't want to be a mariachi singer, you're gonna have to finish a school
i could say i went to college.
i got a phd.
i did the right thing.
two phds.
somebody's chemistry, someone's
i'm going back to new york soon and i want to put this right.
what does your mother think?
he thinks i can make my own decision.
i'm not sure how i feel about that.
we need to talk more about it.
i don't understand why.
we've never talked about it so far, and i know what i want.
johnny, something's wrong.
can you come here and take a look?
that's enough, mr. tremont.
you can get dressed if you want.
is he okay?
yeah, fine.
it's becoming a painful process.
it hasn't spread.
any idea what the problem is?
could be one of a few things.
i doubt you're the klists in your bladder.
the problem is whether he's good-hearted
will your tests show up?
not completely.
his bleeding is not a good sign.
so this is serious?
i think we should get him through a general operation.
if it was serious, dad, they wouldn't let you go.
they'd open it right up and surprise him under the spot.
i wouldn't be surprised if it was just a
i don't think we should tell mom that.
why worry if there's nothing out there?
whatever you say, johnny.
you're the boss.
he told you, didn't he?
of course he did.
then you know there's nothing serious about it.
if it wasn't serious, you should have told me yourself.
look, mom, you need to stay away from any possible stress right now.
you'll feel sorry for this place.
that's why i didn't tell you
he says it's just a cystist.
that's right
it's a simple procedure.
yes, it is.
mom, i'd tell you if something went wrong.
you bet.
okay.
i'm gonna walk around like this, john, but i'm gonna walk around here with my ass open like every nurse
yeah.
that's what it says on the admiss
" long forbid forbidden
go to bed.
you need to sign this, dad.
what is it?
i don't have any baseball gloves.
that was a bad joke.
dr. santana prepared these drugs.
it'll only help comfort you.
if you have any more, i'll have a little.
extra money for the private room.
what time is it
it's evening
isn't it late?
no.
are you comfortable, dad?
fine.
i'll let you get some rest.
it'll make you sleep like a baby.
okay.
remember, if you need anything, just ring that bell.
that's all,
you'll be fine.
you know, john, i see some men, they hug.
we never hugged.
shall we try it?
come on.
i love you, johnny.
i love you, too, dad.
well, mr. tremont, i'm afraid it
cancer.
we've run into a few malignant tumors.
not with your father's age.
well, it's gonna be a stupid question, but are you absolutely sure about the
yeah.
the good thing is we can get to it and destroy it.
listen, dr. santana.
whatever you do, don't tell dad it's cancer.
he's very agitated, and he's very scared
say something more reasonable.
calm down, mr. tremont.
you'd be surprised what the others have been through.
they don't even care about the kids.
i'm not taking this lightly, doctor.
i just want to tell him himself, that's all.
it's cancer, isn'
mom, i told you.
it's just a cyst and they're gon
i want to see him.
mama!
mom, you can't see him right now.
will you listen to me?
you shouldn't be subjected to this kind of stress.
if everything's fine, let me see him.
oh, come on, mom!
john only wants what's best for you.
you know.
you have to listen to him, mom.
he's my husband, and i'll see him.
either you take me there now, or i walk, but i'm going.
what's there?
billy, go quickly and find dr. santana.
come on!
get out of here.
what happened to him?
jake, it's me
why didn't she recognize
jake!
mr. tremont, this is dr. santana.
do you know who i am?
i'm fine.
fine now, thanks.
give me my 00mg librium and check every two hours.
yes, doctor.
it's exactly the same as the other patients.
they often go into shock after every simple operation.
is that standard?
do you know what's going on in there?
i know this is a terrifying experience for you, but what you need to understand is the state of depression here.
he wasn't senile when
why is it senile now?
senility is a strange thing.
and it comes and goes
with a stress like this, it just happens.
i'm sure he'll fix it with a nice rest and medication.
what do we do by the way?
nothing.
what do you mean you're a genius?
we wait for him to respond to medication.
did you tell dad that he had cancer?
he has the right to know that.
i don't know exactly what you want from me, mr. tremont.
dr. ethridridge, doctor eth
i don't trust santana.
you're the hospital manager, and i just want to say that he's not comforting us.
dr. santana is a fine young surgeon.
apparently he's been perfect and professional about your father.
i told him not to tell my dad that he had cancer because he's so scared.
but what he did, he just left and told him.
yeah, it's hard for every doctor to say that.
he has to balance with the family members of his individual individuals... in the balance of the rights of your father'
i'm sure he had no choice.
he had a choice.
he should have listened to me.
i know my father.
why did you tie his arms?
so he wouldn't hurt
he hit himself with his hands.
well, then i'm his son and i don't think he needs it.
let us know when you're ready, and we'll put him back to his place.
i can't believe it.
hey, dad, how's it
does he always look like that?
look, hey, look, look, i brought annie.
and billy's here.
hey, dad
how are you feeling, dad?
can you hear me?
hey, grandpa, it's me, billy.
how's it going
god, john, i can't stand to be here when he looks like this.
i think that's enough.
i've given him a good time.
it'll calm him down.
how long has she been like this?
all the time we've been here.
did he look depressive?
god, doctor.
it's a good thing you're not a
yeah, he seemed depressed.
what's going on in this fucking place?
i meant something unusual, mr. tremont.
mr. tremont- mr.
don't keep telling me that her condition is unusual, doctor.
this extraordinary depression is not unusual, it's true, but the sedative will bring him back.
sedative?
he's hallucinating.
the guy keeps yelling.
she doesn't know any of her family, and you just gave her a sedative?
why didn't you give him the cake?
maybe his throat hurts too!
we decided to release your father tomorrow.
you can come pick her up after 0 : 00 p.m
what do you mean, "taburcard "?
you want to tell me my dad's recovered?
well, of course not, but there's nothing we can do to him in medical.
we can't keep the beds in vain for patients who aren't going to be able to help us
how do we know?
he didn't get any medical help!
what exactly do you mean?
whatever i say.
so they don't care if they're dead or dead.
what kind of talk is that?
i didn't think that-
just calm down.
you want my father out of here?
look what i'm gonna do.
i'll do better than you can.
it turns out you can't take care of him.
john, what are you doing?
mr. tremont- don't touch him.
that's not necessary at all.
i'm gonna take her home.
mr. tremont, what you're doing is very unstable.
what do we do now?
i don't
we don't have a lot of choice but
no, i don't want to do that
i don't want to take him to a nursing
so do i, john, but we have to do something.
wait a second, john.
you can't help him in this situation.
i think i can do that.
i'll do better than the hospital can.
i'll stay and help.
no.
why not?
i'll take care of him.
he's my father.
well, that's my grandpa too.
and i'm your father.
i don't want you here right now, billy.
you mustn't see this.
dad, i'm not a kid
look, i think you should go.
go back to school, go back to mexico.
you're from here.
don't you get it?
yeah, i get it.
i want to talk to him.
i don't think that's a good idea right now, mom, really.
annie's right, mom.
to the hearse cart.
you'd like that, wouldn't you, mario
i mean, " get in the car, " mom.
it was just a slip of the tongue
he'll be fine.
john's gonna take care
let's go, dad.
that kid gooden is awesome, isn't he
the strip reminds me of bob gibson.
you know, a real player.
did you catch it, dad?
good.
there you go.
the mine.
we're gonna have to work on the boat a
okay.
what you need is some home food.
well, i think you're right.
wait till you taste this.
come on, dad.
okay.
hmm, okay.
here.
try this.
come on, dad, give me a piece of b
come on, there you go.
let's try our luck.
daddy, it doesn't bite the glass-
house rules.
you didn't like it there, did you?
neither did i.
we'll be fine, huh?
come on, dad.
that's better.
okay, dad
just a minute and i'll put you to bed.
i'll just put these in.
why are we here, ed?
why aren't we on the farm?
what?
you know, they'll wonder if we stay, you know.
where's the owner
it's your house, dad.
what are you talking about?
mandy didn't come back from the pasture,
i'm worried about him.
well, don't worry, dad
i-i'm sure he's okay.
you think so?
it is.
i need 00 nails for the chicken coop, so help me
it needs to be done
look.
what we need now is a good night's sleep.
don't you always say when there's always a
" let's lay it on you now
i mean, we're having problems right now, dad
let's get on it.
dad?
dad?
dad?
dad, where are you?
dad?
dad?
dad?
dad?
what do you think you're doing here?
oh, dad, come on, let me help you.
come on, dad, come on.
no.
dad, i'm gonna put the
come on out.
come on, dad, get out
dad, come on.
i got you.
shh.
come on.
shh.
i got you, i got you.
i got you.
mr. tremont?
i understand you're bringing your father back to the hospital.
yeah.
i thought it would be hard to look at him at home.
that's no place for him right now.
he can't do it at home, he can't do it here,
maybe it'd be better if he'd just hang around the hill with a helicopter
i know it's hard for kids to accept that their parents are getting older.
say what that means.
i know what it's like to be old
mr. tremont, you must remember that doctors are human, too.
we can't overcome all the problems.
we can't save every patient.
we live in a system where old people eventually break down into toughness.
what is it you want?
why are you here?
there's another doctor in this hospital.
i think he can do better than dr. santana.
what?
i kick everything they say.
he's a good man.
i want him to take a look at your father.
mr. tremont?
mr. tremont?
how are you, mr. tremont?
let's do some tests.
let's get an eeg and locate the metabolic disorder.
give me calcium-magnosis and we'll do vital function tests.
i'm not so sure what caused this, but i'm inclined to diagnose it as an epilepsy.
the question is, what caused this?
and why does he have no consciousness
if you're suggesting another consultation on this, please do it.
no, that won't be necessary.
well, don't think we'll sit in our place and do nothing.
we don't think so.
we've done a series of tests so far and we'll do more.
so far all we've done is shoot the darkness.
i appreciate your modesty, doctor.
but these tests have been done a long time ago, haven't they
she'll sleep here for a while, so that we'll watch her from the monitor any minute.
and i'll check and visit him twice a day.
i won't leave your head until he's well.
i'm afraid that's completely against the hospital laws of
how long can you hold on this?
i don't
i go once a day.
i'm sitting down
i'm talking to him
i'm talking to people passing by
i think if i sit there and talk, he won't die.
what will you do if he dies?
annie, i don't-
you're the only one who can't accept it, john
why don't you just leave him?
i can't explain it to you.
maybe i should be there when the end comes.
i don't
to prove he was still here.
to prove i was his son.
and what did you do positive so far?
annie, this guy got up every day in his life to do what he never liked.
we never asked him.
he did it because he was the father and he had no choice.
he never asked himself if i was happy or happy.
he didn't even know if he had the right
as a result of this election, we have to look after him when he's older and take care
but i messed it up.
john.
i'm ashamed of him, but my mother's reigning him.
it's getting old, too.
embarrassed that i had a marriage that went bad, a job that didn't make sense, a son i'd barely recognize if i saw him on the street.
maybe it'll be too hard for me
i'll be there when she dies.
and i'm gonna kiss him, and then i'm going to cover him up,
and the moment i'm there, i'm going to draw the gold of
i owe him that.
when did you come to town?
i never left.
i'm staying with some friends.
i didn't want to leave my grandfather.
you come here every day?
when you leave, a nurse is looking for me.
i'm standing about half an hour early.
where am i, johnny?
you're in the hospital, d
i can understand that.
why are you here?
or was it an earthquake accident?
is he talking?
yes, he does.
he's learning like a child.
go, uh, report that to dr. chad.
please, please.
why did he look at me so nice
uh, she's a hospital guy, dad.
well, she's a nurse.
this is molly, this is ceceey, uh, this is annie.
that's my dad.
yes, mr. tremont.
how can we make you comfortable?
you can start by taking these pipes off me.
i better eat later.
are you going to starve me here?
okay, we have to take it easy.
remember, you haven't eaten in a long time.
maybe that's why i'm like this
have you thought about that?
all tests are positive, vital signs stable.
this is a healthy human profile.
i've seen people coming out of a coma before.
we don't usually find out why.
i have some theories on that.
not that.
like what?
somehow we gave him the enzym that your brain didn't produce in the iv blend, and we're lucky.
i see.
you know, when we get home, we say that was it.
but in return, it was your love and caring that brought your father back from where he was gone.
i think that's better.
me too.
they're here
what's going on, dad?
what are you looking for?
your mother and i are starting a new life together, johnny.
we need new clothes.
i don't know, d
what do you think mom would say to these?
he'll probably laugh and call me crazy, but he'll laugh.
we've been laughing at home for 00 years.
how about this?
thanks.
thanks, thanks.
ladies and gentlemen, our show begins.
no matter how fierce you are during your performance, please stay put.
the house is proud to present the number one star of our show, the late, late and almost rare man, returned from his successful tour on a successful tour of the scarrans, and almost undefeated.
great jake.
give her a big hand.
come on, give it up.
we're moving on
and he's a veiner friend, billy!
ladies and gentlemen, billy!
this is my outfit i'm wearing when i'm riding a bike in venice.
maybe when you're skating
that's my dress when i watch baseball.
see?
i think i'll wear this more at home.
in fact, i could go see a few games, but not in these clothes.
that's good to hear, jake.
wait.
there's another one.
do it again.
oh, i peed my pants!
stop them!
i'm dying
i didn't hear anybody die laughing, bette
but wouldn't that be nice
i'm telling you, johnny, he's not the same.
maybe his hormones mixed up with someone else's.
you know what happens in hospitals.
nobody's gonna believe he's a 00-year-old man, but he's
you need to talk to somebody, i'm serious.
mom, he's just having fun.
we only played one-ball, but we still... still...
it's a perfect
why don't you take us somewhere after breakfast?
that's a good idea.
maybe mom'll come with us.
i won't get in the car that he
it used to be too fast before.
i hate to think about the things she love right now.
don't worry about your pretty little head, bette.
when old jake tremont is driving behind the wheel, you're gonna be safe for his old bed.
and it's gonna be so much
what are you doing on the ground?
nothing.
i want to see if i can still do a pushup.
" i call it a hot man's pushup. "
what about it, bette?
coming to the beach?
i'm coming, but only with a taxi.
i don't want to go in a cab.
i think we can sail in santa monica.
it's an old man's paradise
every corner is either a practice or a bank.
i want to drive to venice.
oh, i used to love fishing.
where are my fishing gear?
i think i put them somewhere in the garage.
it was 00 years ago.
i'll go get them.
he'll be fine
johnny, i'm scared.
he's talking about people i don't even know, or people i'm sure are dead.
he says we live on a farm in new jersey cape may, and he'll take us there because it's harvest time.
what?
dad.
he told you, huh?
what's going on?
why don't you take me for a drive
john, i need to talk.
johnny, johnny,
what are the odds of me and your mother and four kids living on a farm with a little farm?
i don't think you have a chance, d
isn't there any chance he's on a little farm with a
don't i have four kids there?
you, annie, hank and little lizbeth?
as far as i know, dad, you've been living in l.a. for 00 years
you had a regular job until you retired from lockeed.
before that, we lived in the beachfield and you worked for lockheed there.
i know you're right.
i mean, how can you be in two places at once?
i'm just saying, my life at the same moment, like here, like this,
just sitting around watching the ocean.
if it's too technical or too fantastic, just stop me.
your father is a schizophrenic schizophrenic schizophrenus, as laing would
over the years, he hasn't been getting enough pleasure out of his daily life, so he's isolated his joys into a dream.
he's created more life than he wanted.
how long has this been going on?
it's hard to say now.
at least 00 years, maybe more.
unbelievable.
you see, in order to accomplish this, you have to have an extremely intelligent, vulnerable, emotional personality.
so what's mom's place in all this?
is he out of these?
you're frozen in time.
your mother is very helpful, very sweet.
isn't that the most important thing in the world
he has influence.
the problem is, in this world, your father's place is connected to
she's been a happy person ever since she lost herself.
the walls dividing his two worlds have broken down.
and he's brought into his everyday life the joy he's had for years he
if your mother doesn't agree with her, she'll be lost in sympathy.
hello, all the beautiful people here.
maybe i'll do some jogging on the bike
what do people think if they see you like this?
who cares?
i don't want people calling us old bastards.
and don't worry about what people think anymore.
just ignore the fact that some young people see what we're wearing.
i'm coming with you, dad.
good boy, good boy.
don't worry about me
i'm going to newark to pick up a few things for the farm.
hey, mom, mom, i told you what the doctor said.
you're supposed to help him now.
these comments won't solve anything.
he lives in another time zone.
he needs to show her that.
that's all
i told you, it's just a dream.
it's a fine and wonderful dream world.
dad's learning how to separate the two worlds now.
that's what she's
i don't care what you say.
something happened to him.
this man is not your father.
i think that's the real jake tremont.
the guy's been hiding it for 00
hello.
i'm jake tremont, this is bette tremont.
we're your neighbors across the street.
of course.
how can i help you?
okay.
this is christopher.
how's it going, young man?
and say hello to mr. tremont, chris.
hello.
hello.
if you ever need someone to take care of your child, we're all home.
oh, that's very kind of you
thanks.
no, no, no, it's a lying dog.
that's it.
that's like a lying dog.
yeah.
yeah, he's... too fast.
come on... come
maybe we should we
we wanted to say hello.
we brought you some cake.
come in.
maybe he's out in the closet out there,
did you hear any weird noises last night?
why, did you hear that?
i think i heard something.
i think it should be the wind.
close the drill
" they come with the grudge
how's it going with dad?
the doctor thinks it's a fix in case
he's trying to get into my bed at night.
he's not leaving me alone.
your dad was always into sex, but since he came back from new jersey, he's crazy.
when we first got married, i told my friend fanny hogan the things we were doing, and he told me to leave him and notify the police.
when i confessed with the priest, he said he'd pray for me.
but it didn't work.
you know, when your father was warned, police, priests, prayers, nothing can stop him.
oh, grow up.
" i am a small, short, fat meal
" here's my slap right there's my mouth
" when my body washed out
" you can hear me so hear i'm t
" bend your heart and distill what's inside of me!
oh, bingo.
here.
you know, i realized something.
we don't speak japanese.
you just realized that?
we should try to get to know a new country one night a week.
we just need to eat that country's food and talk about it.
we have to do this.
no, we shouldn't.
where's the control station? "
where's the control station? "
what are you doing?
i'm trying to find the train station.
i think that's a good idea
it's working.
i feel japanese.
oh, yeah, annie, give us some samples, please.
clothes, is it?
" the clothes of the women of the women
"... is very different from what the others have.
" there are peasants in the country like husbands of women
"... and they wear flippantos and trainers.
" while the someone who just got there,
" it makes it difficult for people to recognise their sex because the beard has no beard of the beards. "
i don't know about you, but i don't want to be in a country where i can't recognize the sexes
i'm serious.
this has happened to me in a bar before.
john, john, tell us about agriculture.
" in the land of the mountains, the only 00 % of the topers is the only 00 % functionable
pass the rice, please?
if you say that in japanese.
" could you pass the plow, please. "
you're welcome.
come on, mom.
get on with it.
no.
no.
no.
billy, you-you go ahead.
traditional japanese sports.
what are you prepared for us?
" oatsumo wrestler, dresses in sumo... and dresses
"... before the repent has to reach the weight of 000 pounds, the barrels of
that's a big idea.
make him as fat as you can, and then put him in a diaper.
john, don't you think these guys are interesting?
mario, i'm starting to worry about you.
honey, please... me, please...
wait a minute.
pass, pass... pass.
what do you want?
what about fish?
do you want that?
here.
no, i don't, jake.
i don't eat that.
i don't want to know japanese.
i don't want to know the neighbors
mom, please... just shut up... mom
i wanted him to walk, but now i know what i have.
but since he came back from the hospital, it's been like a loony bin around here.
costumes, jogging, sex for hours.
and there's an e-mail farm in new jersey!
i'm telling you, this man can't even be left alone on the street
dad's really good.
he just wants to have fun!
i didn't live my life to end this way!
at my age, a crazy man like a friend!
you know better than that.
the doctor said he's not crazy!
the truth is, he's been under your impression for 00 years!
oh, come on.
please don't.
don't say that to your mother.
please.
we're family.
we trust each other.
_
and please don't fight.
the way you talk like that kills me.
why?
why are you doing this?
you're gonna bring him back to your old
it can't be what you want.
i want my husband back.
he wants his life back.
he loved you for 00 years.
can't you just leave him alone?
i'm scared, jake.
i don't understand who you are.
i don't recognize you.
i know.
look at me or some old man who sees me.
but inside, thank god, bette, i feel 00.
and i'm acting like one, i guess.
your other life, jake, is forfeiters.
what's so bad for me?
we crossed the border a little.
a little.
are you asking me to go back to our old life?
oh, no.
i'm asking you to come back to life as we want.
you were so good.
not just me, the world... but
we used to have a good time, remember?
we used to dance all the time.
you were such a good dancer.
and i'd like to dance with you one last time before i die.
don't talk about death.
dying is not a sin.
so is life.
morning, mom.
morning.
nice outfit
your father likes it.
mr. tremont?
i have some news.
not very good.
what's that?
well, it's not the same in every case, but it looks like, uh... well...
okay, good doctor, you can tell me the truth.
the cancer's back
it's spread
lymph glands are infected.
how much?
it's hard to say.
every patient looks different.
dr. chad?
i don't
hey, dad, what are you doing up so late?
i'm waiting for you.
why?
you see, your mother and i were divorced when you were too young to come home late.
i think i've lost my sense of concern for my son as a father.
you want me to go out and come back again?
no, just sit down and talk.
what do you want to talk about?
i'll try to tell you something.
i want to give you some advice as your father.
some predictions.
i can't think of anything.
it might be hard for someone your age to understand someone my age.
you know, every time we see each other, we're always on the move.
you go, or i come, or we're at someone's wedding.
all we talk about is bags, bags, or little sandwiches we can eat.
i don't know much about you.
well, um, i'm from, like, 0' 00,
i like sports, i like bikes-
you know, we always do the same thing.
we come to the side, to say something incredible, and then one of us makes a joke.
talk to me.
tell me about mexico.
i like it there.
ah, there are people who are sincere and understanding
well, the dream is there in a rhythm.
do you have a lot of friends there?
yeah, there's five of us.
you know, we hang out as a group.
we work together.
we share everything we do.
we share the cleaning, the housework.
we're a real family.
other guys from school too?
well, two of them are girls.
life has changed, billy.
it's hard to believe that she's changed
why do the money come before your mother and me?
oh.
you said you wanted to talk.
okay.
because, er, this is about what a man was before.
some dad wears a suit and makes good money.
okay, that's easy.
because i love the power of it.
it's nice to be the one who's got good work and everyone's running at him...
and something should have been given, this was my family.
well, i never did that.
i never got away from my family.
running away was the hardest thing that ever happened to
that didn't seem like it.
i mean, because we wanted to be normal.
that's what it says in the books
"normal divorce.
but it hurt.
a little.
it still hurts.
i missed you, billy.
and you never needed me around you.
but i like to stay in your life.
i'm your father.
i've got some advice for you.
someone i owe something to.
what is it?
forgiveness.
he slept a little.
were you here all afternoon?
he feels better when i'm here.
let's go downstairs and get something to eat.
the doctor will be here shortly.
i don't want to miss him
i'll catch up with you.
come on.
where's mom?
she went down for dinner with billy.
oh, good.
how are you feeling?
excellent.
i'd say it's
you know what i think?
what?
0000 yankees-dodgers games.
what?
i'm trying, but all i'm thinking about is these old games and old knees.
bonanza.
oh, that's great, dad.
what about the 0000 yankees-dodgers games?
who took it?
this is the biggest case in baseball history.
they're the middle-class joe dimaggio, the prince of hunters, the stars, and the dodger left-hangers, and the dodger fucking
al gionfriddo, second-stringer.
he's just the left wing player
carl furo played because he was crippled.
do you know this story?
tell me.
well, in the sixth game, it was 0-0 dodgers in the first place in the subdermal strike.
two in, two out.
top dimaggio.
he threw it into the left wing's belly, made the most famous run he'd ever had
everybody there knew that.
but that little guy gionfriddo showed up.
he ran after the ball.
but he couldn't take it that joe dimaggio shot the ball.
at the last moment, he jumped.
he lived forever.
but the main event has come.
dimaggio started his second tour run, but gionfriddo was catching the ball in line.
he got so depressed, he kicked the dirt.
you like this?
this man who never showed his emotions, he was human in public.
it was al gionfriddo who exposed his emotions.
you know what that means to me?
what is it?
in america, anything is possible if you do your job well.
sometimes i wanted to take care of you more when you were a kid.
i'd like to kiss you more.
you did this, dad, you did it.
do you know how much i love you?
yeah.
a lot has happened, johnny.
good, sometimes bad.
honey, i'm putting these in the car.
okay.
did you talk to mom?
mom's staying here for now.
until the middle of next month.
we'll see about that later.
okay.
i think he's gonna be
how are you holding up?
i miss him.
yeah, me too.
go ahead, i'll catch up with you.
one moment, please.
you start.
mm... hmm
grandpa, we just wanted to say good-bye before we went over the grid.
well, and we decided this was the right place to do it.
because there's so much more here than you
you have something that's living and growing.
as far as i feel about you... as i feel about
that was fun.
yeah.
grandpa, i love you, and i'll always miss you.
my father and i are here together.
that's good.
that's a good idea.
i feel better.
me too.
tobacco and they say it's a combination of the black dump that brings out demons and invites them.
it looked at me like it was trying to expose a mystery to me.
the turkish has come to florence.
but from what i understand about this year, it's not gonna be the same high-end parade.
we'll pay you half now, when the traditional trade rules are over.
tell me, is there anything else you're afraid of
_
but the fact is, i've designed a more ambitious series of devices that i know your highly intelligent intelligence will interest you.
speaking of which, a two-headed calf is dead on the farm of zitto.
the last corpse you brought was rotting when i stabbed you with a knife.
a card can reveal its destiny, not only the nature of one person's will.
this represents sacrifice.

why don't night guards give that man a break?
the guy's sword was too loose and now he finds himself looking at this beautiful sword.

what did he give you?
same butt, very different faces, and when i realized that, i took a sip of his tit.
i'm not gonna let you ruin our family's name with your flippers and your basic attempt to market yourself.
as much as i wish to deny you, our reputations are connected.

you remember when you were a kid, there was an incident.
i was a kid in vinci.
i was sent to fetch the lost lamb.
what am i supposed to do until then?
fate has chosen you, leonardo.
i don't believe in fate.
then believe in yourself.
where do i start looking?
with the hanged man, from the depth of the soul
he already opened the door for you.
what about mom?
he'll be waiting for you on the other side.
all you have to do is walk through the door.
master!
we've been looking for you since last night.
this place has been empty for centuries, leo.
master, the night guards were looking for you.
they said lorenzo medici himself wanted you.

i believe that people can fly, and i assume that god has blessed us with minds that can imagine it.
anything that can be imagined can finally be done.
anyone who says otherwise is a fool.
what exactly are you suggesting?
i hope to be hired as an army engineer.
i'm a humanist, da vinci.
i had nothing to do with waging war.
rome too.
as needed, both states formed an alliance with other nations.
sforza's death was the end of the game board.
you need your own weapons, sir.
i'll give you a modest salary.
to see if this is happening, your mechanism can actually be done.
shall we say 000 florins then?
if you haggle any further, i'll cut your tongue
as you say, sir.
thank you.
you used lucrezia to get to me, didn't you?
i take advantage of everything i can to achieve my goals.
smart, but i suggest you don't act too smart around me.

no, sir.

there's no point in going on with this game any longer, ms. donati.
i knew it was you the first time you came near me.
how did you know?
i drew you.
your faces, your position, your movement.
the more intriguing question is why a noble woman would risk her reputation for a degenerate artist.
isn't that what the carnival is about?
tell me what it is.
so you knew i'd call you.
lorenzo liked his designs.
may i see some of your miracles?
what's that?
it's a device to slow someone's down rate.
and under what circumstances can i use this?
suppose you're trapped in a castle.
you can take it and you can safely float to freedom in the air.
thank god.
lorenzo's interest in you is obviously right.
you risked more.
maybe his life.
what do you depend on my reckless behavior?
i'm forbidden meyv, and think your destiny is marked as well.
you're the third person this week to tell me something about fate.
maybe you just started hearing what they're called.
now... now
fuck me again, leonardo.
this time, remember, you're not the only one capable of manipulation.
for certain reasons, we can't let you through the front door.
how rude of me.
i promised you i'd pay first.
i admit it satisfies you?
then start telling.
there's a new player on stage
an artist known as leonardo da vinci.
the medicis hired him to build siege weapons.
artists are a clown of families.
i don't understand why this news would concern us.
this artist is different.
my spy in florence.
if i'm not mistaken, you're lupo merc
head of the secret archives.
looks like the turkish got himself a new champion.
keep watching him.
see if he's cooperating.
what if he doesn't?
then da vinci will be hurt in hell.
with other enemies of god.
don't be to
yeah, you too.
in a good defense, you have to act on the offensive line.
when the bad guy comes at you, you'll cross the line and make a new line.
until the man gets old or until you save me?
angel, i didn't ask you to teach me to drill hol
i want to learn to fight.
you don't believe i'm gonna do
men aren't always around to protect women.
besides, what if you were the man i had to fight?
could be that.
okay.

ok!
you're on the

i was making friends with young billy.

i hope you've stayed out of trouble this time.
let's go home.
this is the second time you've brought our nephew back to us.
our pleasure.
" lt's a pleasure to have the sense that he has nothing to do with it.
good boy.
by the way, get out.
why don't you try listening to that big mouth all the time instead of just shutting off your big mouth
you weren't captain of the debate team, were you?
at least... at least... lindsey...
your attempt to get angel to train you, your responsibility.
i'm proud of you.
it never hurts to be ready.
if you think he can help you fight, why not?
i was kidding.
wesley, if you want to get to know fred better maybe the next time you have the chance to imply that you wouldn't want us to come over.
i mean... i
is it that obvious?
i don't think the others have not
still, the last thing any of us should do is be a couple with each other.
office love, even under the most normal circumstances... under normal circumstances...
we don't live under normal circumstances.
what are the chances we can find someone out there who can deal with what we have to deal with?
i don't know, maybe we should think...
with each other?
i was actually going to say to be alone.
wesley, if you like him, tell him.
this murder happened a week ago.
why are they showing this to me now?
how did you get these?
the police sold you these?
if the victim is important, they sell these.
he said she didn't listen to him.
he was trying to make her stop talking.
actually, it worked.
and look who was there 00 minutes before the crime occurred.
what?
okay, he's n
and who is it?
are you sure it's him?
when you take out one of hell's size, you remember his face.
yeah, that's him.
now we know why the powers made me see the woman's death.
he died because of me.
angel, if this is somehow responsible, then so am i.
angel... angel
hey.
whatever's happening now, you're not responsible for this, and neither am i.
but i know who you are.
you seem a little nervous, lilah.
it's been a long day at the office
it's been brought
i was gonna do that.
i know that some of his powers... don't
billy never touched me, and you can't touch him.
this family is the most important family in the country.
they own half the east coast.
the law doesn't do anything to them.
it's not like you're chopping some monsters or
stay away from my client.
i don't think it'd be very good to ring
how about we sneak in, dress up like security guards?
okay, you want to be next?
i think we should wait here.
why wouldn't it surprise me if i could go in without an invitation?
as far as i know, you have a permanent invitation.
i've never hurt a woman in my life.
i just like to watch.
you're coming back.
really?
you're looking for me.
we're taking you in for questioning.
sanchez, read him his rights.
who are you?
no one.
i'll tell you what my problem is, there's a woman here that never listens.
yeah, giving up $ 00 million in cash and running away to a prison cell.
yeah, but for how long?
an impenetrable cube of hellfire in a demon dimension is nothing to him, so my guess is that a simple obstacle is not a problem for him.
angel, what are you going to do?
you can't just walk into a police station and play a terminator.
there was an accident.
he can tell you what billy did to her partner before he attacked her.
it's not a bad idea for one of us to wait in the hospital for a visit to a sick
some of the blood in the car is his.
not human.
he came through here.
i'll take a sample to the hotel, see what kind of creature billy was.
i'll take care of a errand.
normal, normal, everyday err
cordelia.
i don't think you should do this.
how could i not?
i managed to get a sample of billy's blood.
maybe we can determine which demon line he's got and figure out how his power works.
will you hand me the glass plates?
thank you.
are you going to invite me in?
please, come in.
i want you to tell me about billy.
tell angela everything you didn't tell her.
what makes you think i'm gonna do that?
first of all, it's your face.
i understand the exiled mascara right away.
i don't switch sides with challenges
angel feels responsible for this kid because he brought him back from hell.
and i feel responsible because he did it to save me.
in fact, you're all responsible for this because you're a depraved bitch.
he's widened the he
pink, this spring isn't fashionable
billy blim makes people crazy.
then why didn't he affect angel?
others can take hours.
god, i hope angel doesn't start to feel angry.
you didn't really see it
i have to find billy.
and i'm gonna help you, why?
remember that guy you hired to get into my visions?
you know what he did to me, what did he look like?
i was cut, torn up, my face disfigured, burning in pain every second, whether it would end or just get worse until i die.
it's about mercy.
there's certainly nothing you can do to stop it.
he could be wiped out of his life by someone else
and a strong enough woman would never bear to wear a screw-up bitch cover.
where's billy?
i'm a 00-year cabbie, i understand why you're doing this.
there's a reason for that, am i right?
how many times do you want to talk to your client with fists?
surprise you?
he probably sat in the back and told him how to drive the car.
you know the type.
he probably deserved it.
like i said... like i said
dylan, your cousin's here
hey, dylan.
billy.
i didn't know you were having a party
i thought we agreed you wouldn't come here anymore after the last thing.
do you want or should i?
some of the red blood cells seem very powerful.
these are probably the fact that billy came from the demon line.
then it looks like billy's got the power to drive people crazy, his blood.
which means it could have been through teri or spit and even with touch.
speaking of spit, where's cordelia?
" i guess you knew he was out when you said,'cause you talked to him.
well... i thought... that i.
if you lie to me again, we'll have a serious problem.
sit down, fred.
there's something we need to talk about.
i'm sorry i didn't tell you cordelia's gone.
we still have to make some changes around here.
change can be good, i guess.
like you don't wear those provocative clothes anymore.
provocative?
maybe your mom and dad never told you what men and dad went after grown men.
you can't just come in here all the time, and you'
you're really pushing me to get it.
is that what you want?
stop it.
are we standing up now?
you round your hair back, wink your eyes, and then when we turn around, you laugh at us.
because you're attached to life, do you think you can do anything you want because somewhere bleeding?
no.
i'll show you blood.
what do you tell a woman with two black eyes in black red?
nothing you've already said twice.
no sense of humor.
to be honest, i'm calling to kill that bastard.
come in.
you should know the rules about billy.
everyone in the family knows these rules.
don't leave your girlfriend alone with her, keep your pet away from her and never let her touch you.
when you want money, drop it at the table and walk
can you explain something to me?
why did you invite me in after you told me i wanted to kill your cousin?
you're angel, right?
did billy mention me?
he said a very emotional man named angel would be here soon.
melodrama is exaggerating... melod
fred.
i know what you're doing.
and who you are.
you're pulling me.
you're forcing me to find you.
it's like a game of kitty-
you're making me deceive in girl parts.
but you never give up, do you?
no, you keep laughing and running.
guess what, love, i'm not one of those new bitters.
i'm a man.
you can't show up, can you?
no, you hide.
you cheat.
and you snake, plotting behind our backs.
"al honey, eat this.
it's just an apple tw
the problem is your sex.
why are you making me do this?
do i know you?
i thought we should meet.
i'm the woman wolfram and hart tortured to get you out of your burning cell.
i see.
poor desperate, desperate, crushed woman needs to knock out all the injustices that have been done to her
no, asshole.
i'm here to send you back.
i mean, of course you women are whores who sell yourself for money and prestige but men are so bad.
maybe even worse.
they're willing to waste their careers, their families, even their lives for what's under your sk
i'm wearing pants.
in fact, i'm superior because i have an arrow pointed at your carotid artery.
and it's a coincidence that i use a penis-shaped
i don't think
you don't have the guts to do it
you were wrong again.
he can't hurt me
no, i'm not going to hurt him.
i'm not gonna hurt him at
here.
i'd say he was examining the blood from billy's handprint.
so the blood on the handprint on the fingerprint down there, billy's blood
you're telling me that wes turned into a psycho killer because of the hand mark i took and looked at?
it worries me when you put it that way.
i'd better get out of here
lock the door behind me.
maybe we should apply plan b.
oh, god.
you said we should apply to plan b, but what's plan b?
plan b... plan
plan b... plan
plan b, if you don't stop fucking around if you don't stop
oh, god.
cordy, get out of here.
all the anger, all the hatred, all the hatred for the surface.
please go.
i can't
that's my problem.
you think that's your problem?
you know what your real problem is?
guys like that!
because your power doesn't affect me.
charles, you're scaring me.
take this and knock me out.
you want me to hit you?
yes!
i can't
you might want to.
hit me!
charles, please.
"charles, please. " fine.
you'll pay for this.
would you like to hear my theory, fred?
about how stupid you are.
i believe that after five years of living in a cave, you'll instinctively retreat to small, dark places rather than run outside for safety.
let's get this over with.
i'm sorry, wesley.
are you sorry?
you were right about me liking dark places to hide.
but you also forgot that i like to develop things.
neither do i.
i mean, you're a man, but why didn't billy's touch affect you?
maybe it's' cause i'm
and a vampire can never become a monster.
you know that thing that billy brings out in other people?
it was always about the pain and the pleasure.
i suppose you could say that your demonic aspect makes you less important than humans.
he's a noble
i mean, it's really disturbing that you're bi
strange.
what is it?
i'm getting used to fighting outside, and i'm also relaxing.
i understand that.
wesley, it's me, fred
does it hurt?
i left you a lot of messages.
i'm so sorry.
wesley, you have to go back to work.
how can you not?
but it's time to come back.
fred.
something inside me was forced to surface.
god, no.
it wasn't something in you, wesley.
it was something that was done to you.
i don't know what kind of man i am anymore.
i know.
you're a good man.
will i see you back at the office?
yeah.
good.
why would he risk anything to escape from compassionate arms?
tomorrow we'll walk to rome with crixus.
but i want you to go with spartacus.
one rabbit?
bring your torch over here!
his people are known for the bull stamp.
and the eagle is dol
the mark of gennaus pompeius magnus.
i thought pompey had a run-in with the renegade harborius in a field.
if pompey's scouts return to the republic, he and his legions will follow them.
let me know if you see any movement on the side.
then we must support the ghost and see it through the flesh and light days.
was it the end she always dreamed of?
the days after we parted ways were filled with victory.
our enemy's blood was turning the dead, turning our enchantment into the fields.
same fate as crixus?
to show spartacus the end of his life.
crassus tempts you to fool you.
if i only had my own life, maybe i'd have fallen into his trap.
the advance unit was headed south, towards crassus' legions.
order the apollo to leave the camp at high speed it up from the sky.
a whore named canthara was beaten and found stabbed to the throat from the womb.
i'm surprised at this offer.
i don't know that pompey was supportive in a case that couldn't
if he had such desire, why didn't he show up for himself?
i wouldn't risk going to the commander's camp
and i'm not leaving my duty to bow before a imaginary tremor.
you can't really be thinking about accepting this offer.
pompey wants to know what he knows about spartacus to steal his victory from deserving it.
and when the time comes, we can get revenge for the wounded.
let's make it up to ourselves with the theme of the living
to console death's leftovers.
every drop of roman blood will glory to the honour of those taken from us!
i'm with professor charles eppes right now, a calsci mathematician who often consults for the fbi.
are you here to help the fbi find bonnie parks?

yeah, that's true, but each suspect has been urged in a different degree
you know, you could put a water gun in the mouth of the clown who'd fill a balloon.
an asymmetric threat assessment allows us to measure the factorsthat feed motive in every suspect, just like the mechanism in the game calculating the flow of water into each clown's mouth.
we need to find out what the unsub feeds to the point where it will blow up.
especially those who are afraid of him, who they are afraid of.
the filter pump has been making a lot of noise lately.

his team solved the notes we found in the women's office.
your husband, your ex-husband, your angry boyfriend.
yeah, i'm on my way right now.
charlie, who might have tried to do this to you?
because you were already so pissed off about my interview.
what's happening shouldn't
it was december.
can we see this in the room and not here?
good man.
and you know my mother sacrificed so much to get her to do something big.
i started this job when i was 00.
it makes taylor look like a great hero to win a income center in a rotten area.
he's mostly talking to the pathetic people who were forced out to make room for the website, and they were frightened by taylor's thugs.
i'm still working on it.
which means i need to know what i've analyzed the distress analysis, and that's the problem.
i told your dad i'd shoot.
so how cute is seeing the electric switch?
right?
i don't know how long you're gonna
you're either very brave or your brain is small.
i have sonny layva.
when i find bonnie, he'll mark sonny.
there's no way that sonny's kidnapping alone.
when i was being held on that freighter, when they handcuffed me, lancer was sticking me with needles, there was something that made me hold
that was knowing my crew was coming for me.
no matter how bad it was, you and david and megan and don were working hard and you were supposed to come through that door.
because i did the same thing when i first saw battle in afghanistan.
yeah, well, ten-digit property numbers, square footage, land numbers, values, they're all masked up.
if you apply force to a particular buoy pulling it down, the buoy pulls it down, it will force them to the shaman's shamaness in his neighbourhood.

hundreds of millions, probably.

nobody loves french.
we've lost contact with our forward reconnaissance units.
but based on the analysis of the virus, we know this is the point where the virus began to emit.
we won't know until we see an example.
you'll go in there with special forces, find any survivors and retrieve a blood sample from the survivors, but before the marines destroy the entire area at 00.00.
i don't need to tell you what will happen if 00 minutes gets the story.
what's that smell?
we did it.
the attempts to stop the living dead have been neutralized.

you're not answering my calls.
that's why i came to see you.
no flying.
how can you find me in the middle of san francisco and not find my husband?
your husband doesn't want to be found.
i told you that.
yeah, i told you i would give you all i could.
that's not how it works, janet.
maybe it didn't work out because my husband paid you.
understand?
yeah.
megan? me
megan? me
megan? me
megan? me
megan, answer me!

i'm not one of them.
i don't
i woke up five minutes ago.
how did you get out of your room?
there was a key.
you don't have the keys?
calm down.
do you know why you're here?
why would someone do that?
i owe some people some money.
how much?
about $ 0,000.
looks like it's not worth the trouble.
anyone else?
my husband.
what could your husband want from me?
where are we? where
i don't
what's the last thing you remember?
i was in the park... and...
where is it

i was in new york.
let me see.
i'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

is that so?
yeah.
what's wrong?

what's the difference
we'll leave them.
of course i can leave you.

can anyone hear me?
anyone?
sound!
what is this place?
for god's sake, let me out
listen to me.

calm down, soldier
we're on your side.

yeah.
we're all hostages.
it's ok
i didn't think i drank that much.
are you okay?
i think my standards are slipping.
do you know where he is?
you know what that is?
i think i should make a call.
come.
where are the people who took us?
i won't wait to find out.
it's not working
why don't they come pick us up?
i don't understand.
this behavior is contagious, sir!

you see this?
a missing person in a playground in the playground
something small enough not to interest us.
it was a mother they kidnap
they didn't touch the kid.
a mother abandons her child.
no, just a mother.
good mom.
she was home watching kids.
that sounds... that sounds
if this was going to happen, it could already be in
i found a video.
of course you found the image.
i'm not talking to assumptions,
the cops aren't ignoring evidence like they used to.

i'm looking at you.
your mother's going to end up in a dead body bag, mark

i can't see anything.
everybody think.
what was the last thing you remember?
last night, i went to sleep like every night and i woke up here.
who could have done this?
what's your worth?

i make $ 00,000 a year.
i have $ 00,000.
you, soldier?
the army doesn't pay much, sir.
what about you?
i'm not worth anything to anyone but myself.
maybe, maybe not.
why do you think they kidnapped you?
i'd rather not say.
what do you do?
no offense, but i don't know who you are.
we're sitting here thinking where the bad guys are.
how do we know the villains aren't here?
he's right
one of us could be one of them.
but there's only joe we don't know about.
everyone has value in their eyes.
i don't have money, i don't have
i have no value in anyone's eyes.
maybe it's your life insurance.
no.
that's the only reason i know someone's kidnapping
not everyone is kidnapped for

it's hard to do if we move.

i wish they'd come and get us.
this is much worse.
we have a few hours before dark.
you mean walk?
until someone stops us.
is that a gun locker?
nobody move!
what?
what do you want us to do?
get down, okay?
do what he says.
get down!
ok, which one of you is in charge?
you're in charge, right?
so you're not them?
so you're not one of them.
i don't even know who the lady is, okay
listen.
we were kidnapped just like you.
i don't know that.
get down, okay?
i won't say it again!
if you want to shoot me, go ahead.
i have nothing to lose.
okay?

i won't stop squeezing it until some answers

how do we get out of here?
i don't
red lights, whatever.
i woke up in that hotel over there.
it was you.
i heard you walk past my room.
was it you who asked for help?
so you're saying you left him?
look, no offense.
enough.
so what do we do with him?
does it matter?
could be one of them.
okay.
who's coming with me?
i.
what else?
we don't know what's out there
what, stay here?
i'm just saying we have to be cautious.
wait till dark.
then i take the gun and i explore it.
what if you get caught in the darkness?
i'm willing to risk that.
well, that's your job, isn't
but then you'll be dead with the only shotgun we have.
if that's what you think... then
i don't expect darkness.
i'm going home right now.
you can stay here and take care of the others.
who authorized that?
you did.
if i'm not back by tomorrow, you'll make
i'll get help.
no, no.
please don't go.
i have to.
were you in the army, joe?

are you kidding?
where did you get such an idea?
what you said.
it's what you know, like the way you communicate with that
what profession is that?
janet, your daughter is probably very good.
my daughter is 0 years old, okay?
he has an allergic constitution, and he has a special diet to do.
well, what if something happens to you here... something happ
okay, but if anything happens to you, you have family, right?
i mean, your life seems unlikely.

exactly.
there's no one who can't wait
joe?
joe, can you hear me?
what happened?
wait a minute!
we can't leave them to die.
we don't leave anyone behind, but there's a way to do this, there's
okay.
okay.
you think they were shot?
i didn't hear anything.
i don't see any blood.
there should have been a lot of blood.

okay.
mcnair!
obviously this is not working.
we have to go back.
get inside!
get inside!
let's go inside.
remember the last time you saw your daughter?
not recently.
we were both very busy.
he had babysitting jobs, and i had...
to be honest, my daughter and i weren't talk
in fact, he wasn't talking to me.
he had me out of his life until recently.
i never even met her husband.
she thought megan should know her grandmother.
he never thought i was a good parent.
he said i was being bad.
but i never hit him.
once.
i hit him with a hairbrush until it was broken.
me and my daughter... my daughter
you see, both our wills are very strong.
i found this in your room.
no.
no, not mine.
then whose is it?
thank you, grandma.
i look forward to him coming home to show my mother.
yeah, i'm sure he'll be very happy
now take your baby upstairs and play with it.
i need to talk to mr. renbe.
come on.
come on.
if there's a good thing about this, it's that i won a second chance.
a chance to be a good parent who says i can't be.
yeah, that's definitely a blessing
thank you for your time, ma'am.
and don't worry about your daughter.
i'm sure he'll be back soon
i'm sure it'll all work out just fine.
the supermarket is empty.
what about the others?
they're still lying there.

it's the only way to lose weight and stay away from him.
i won't put you on a diet.
eat whatever you want.
no more time, no more frustration.
_
the key shows up with a plan, so we can help each other out.
we'll ask each other questions and look for answers inside ourselves.
in short, we'll expose ourselves.
let's get started.
i want you all to stand up and take off your clothes.
nobody be shy.
then you better leave.
honey, come on.
let's go.
i like being fat and naked.

i'm not fat, i'm overweight.
four months ago i weighed 00 pounds.

one, two, three kilos... three...
a little diet and exercise and they get lost.
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 00, 00...
it always works.
00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00...
twenty pounds.
i've had insomnia since i was ten years old, so it's more time to do things and especially eat in the day.

i use sleeping pills because if i wake up at night i start eating.

privacy or sex?
we can hang a cover.

a 0000 uero? 0000?
i'll show you what's precious.
how about an autographed poster?
i had more pictures in magazines, and i got even fatter, i ate more and i was more worried.
and more and more... and more...
that's enough, my partner sued me, and he froze all my accounts as a precaution.
are the pills working?
they don't affect your state of mind
it's not my fault you're fat, asshole
it'll require daily energy.
what about the others?
how does being fat make you work?
i knew a new brand of perfume at a mall.
but if you see it, you'd think i was selling poison instead of perfume...
sofia, how can i help you?
i'm working at a big company now on a phone deal.
sofia, how can i help you?
i'm too fat to chase bad guys, so i'm investigating dead guys
one night i was looking at a corpse in casa christac, a very expensive restaurant i always wanted to go to.
the ring was stuck in his throat and strangled to death
the waiter heimlich applied, but when the ring turns out it was too late.
there was a sign inside the ring that i couldn't read.
i got curious and... licked it clean.
i did it without thinking.
it's a reflex.
the thing is, i like it.
it tasted fresh oysters and galicia wine.
i was wondering, what did the article say?
" i'll even love you in the barn. "

how does being fat make you work?
i work at home, so it doesn't.
i'm writing internet ptootoli and systems codes.

he doesn't know this situation, and i won't tell
he's a telecom expert who hasn't got my web
i didn't want to buy one.
why don't you tell him and get rid of him
how about helping me lose 00 pounds?
when is she coming back?
in six months.
don't worry, if he's in america, he'll be back as fat
is it working?
no, wait a minute.
come and i'll give you a special treat.
did you go to him later?
no, i didn't.
maybe you should go.
it's not just about saving ourselves.
it's about saving the others, or at least trying to.
i'll go if i have to.
you don't trust alex?
but i don't like him looking at naked beautiful women.
maybe that's why she doesn't want to see me n

what happened to her, enrique?
i'll die!
what did they do to him?
do it now.
be brave enough to do that.
i know you'll leave me.

that's why i want you to leave me now.
don't touch me
stop.
stop!
i haven't left the house in the last 0 months
all i do is work and eat.
i have no life without german.

you can't spend your whole life with a man
i didn't try different things, i didn't live, i didn't experience
i feel like i've been missing out on my life for 00 years.
i got fat because i wanted him to leave me.
leave me, leave me, leave me!
i went for a run and my partner came to cheer me up.
suddenly i heard a noise, i turn around and there was a man fighting with my partner.
i thought you robbed him.
he pushed him and ran away.
i tried to get help, but... apparently my heart couldn't take it.
did you see the man who robbed him?
no.
it was too dark.
did your partner have any problems with anyone?
no.

why do you think you lost weight?

in case your blood sugar drops?
give it to me.
open the book.
give me the candy
open the book.
is it fixed?
yeah, you got it.
if it breaks down again, i'll break it in your
now cabin zero, erika... now... cabin
erika... erika
hi, honey.
how was work?
fine.
the guy was looking at his ass.
who, carlos?
i'm so excited!
i don't find it funny.
you're jealous.
no.
you think that's true?
would you like me to look at other girls?
you wouldn't like it, would you
i don't think it's fun
because i'm not okay
all i think about is having sex with you.
and again.
i see you dressed like that... and... and
we could stop by the house by the way.
did they bring more furniture?
we're sex addicts.
no, we're love addicts.
pilar... p
we should start sleeping apart.
i can't sleep alone, i'm
fine, but i have to go out and find a new apartment.
find someone to stay and take care of you.
pilar!
the doctor said i'm good enough to go on living normal.
what's wrong
you're my partner's wife.
we can't play happy double.
fine, but you're gay.
you'll be fine
besides, we were friends before i met jesus.
remember when we slept together in college?
it was awful!
i made sure i was gay that day.
jesus hasn't been with me for 00 months.
i think he was a little gay.
pilar, no.
i'm horny
close your eyes and think i'm a man.
no!
like one of those sexy kids you fucked 000 euros.
let's see what happens
use your teeth a little.
that's it, gently, careful...
until she bent over and gave me a blowjob.
did you get an erection?
how was it?
oral sex is a blowjob.
you'll enjoy this experience as much as i enjoy it.
what about him?
did you do anything to him?
like what?
like what he did to you.
no, gross!
one question, mr. therapist.
isn't it a little unusual for you to talk about personal things in a bar?
a beer can reveal things in therapy that don't reveal itself.
like your heterosexual relationship.
that happy nun really bothers me.
he's always happy and he's talking about his cupcake and another cupcake and another cupcake... and another
what a pain!
i think i just saw leonor leave.
i swear it was him.
another!
what happened to the greedy manager?
i don't
one day he came to the wrong group
i'm sorry, i came at the wrong time.
it wasn't the wrong time, it
and he never came back.
i called, but she didn't answer.
then he sent a message saying he left it.
potato chips?
take one.
what was the deal?
i'm just suggesting potato chips.
if he gets it, i'll take it.
i feel guilty when i eat alone.
you told us to stop blaming ourselves.
giving up is one thing, it's one thing to put it on others' backs
give me the damn chips!
no more guilt.
feeling better?
much better.
how much more pizza are we looking at?
all i can get is a cold pizza.
" i am a fat, pushed out of society, can eat whatever i want, keep your excuse to yourself.
i don't want to hear any more of this, understand?
your excuse is ready.
yes, it is.
what's that?
tickets to the school trip.
you never sold it.
i'm not going to a party or a trip.
samuel's not going?
i don't
pity, it looks good.
come on, like dad said.
one for you, one for me and everybody's happy.
okay.
you're right, only the most fat kid in class would like me.
fat couple, how nice.
" why do you like him? " like him?
he's incompetent, ridiculous, he's a total loser... a total
great.
if you send him a message, you can have a slice.
two slices or no deal.
i'll have the candy in 0 slices and bags
there's no sugar in my bag.
okay, okay
take the small one, not the big one.
aren't you eating?
i don't eat snacks.
you never mentioned him.
he learns spanish and becomes a good christian.
he'll sing us a religious song from his country.
okay?
come on, champ.
i dedicate it to my friend sofia.
so she marries me.
how cute.
imagine if we were walking down the aisle with this music.
no, we'll get a proper choir.
the choir could do a nice fund music.
if you don't let me have my beard, you can forget this
like tarzan.
spoiled.
okay, therapist.
are you sure you don't want to close your eyes and leave yourself in the flow?
no, because i'm your therapist, it's not
goodbye then.
can i have another beer?
you brought your boyfriend.
he's not my boyfriend, he's a jer
he said he was crazy about you.
i just spoke to him, he said you were great.
i hate alcohol.
relax, you'll get the job.
come on!
i hate alcohol too.
hi.
pilar, what are you doing here?
the pills aren't working without you around me.
you don't belong here.
why?
i can help you, you idiot.
there are less reluctant roads.
don't pay me
why would you pay for sex?
you can't have someone who really loves you.
i don't want to love anyone, understand?
for not finding the right person.
i'm not right for anyone, pilar.
come on.
pilar i'm gay, okay?
i like men, don't you understand?
go away!
go!
why?
i can't hear you.
remember when you came home late i pretended to sleep and you still fucked me?
yes, i remember.
i saw my gynecologist today.
you know, normal life.
okay.
i have something to do tomorrow.
relax, i'll be right inside.
you want me to fall asleep.
i want you to come to bed with me.
and i'm telling you i'm gonna clean up first.
paula?
your folks don't help you deal with your brother?
mine only think about themselves and their perfect marriage.
all they do is fuck all day long.
yay!
you must learn to protect yourself.
i found unpleasant rat poison on the internet.
paula, if she's staying, i'll sleep on the couch.
you'll sleep on any kind of couch anyway.
come on, put it away.
one for you... one
come on.
and one for me.
it tastes good, doesn't
even when i was a kid, i felt different
i didn't like girls playing soccer or anything like that.
because if you're fat and lonely, no one asks why you're not acting like the others.
nobody would notice that i was gay, or i was gay.
but i didn't give up my confusion until the special olympics in' 00.
they let me volunteer, miraculously, in, uh,
and they gave me to the swimmers.
there was an incredibly handsome australian who was holding him out of the pool because he had no legs there.
i don't know which made me happier, his smile on his wheelchair when he won the bronze medal or when he gets my virginity.
my first joke was a disabled.
i'm tired of being gay.
really.
we're supposed to be emotional, happy, alive, tolerant.
mankind's priority.
and that's not me.
i can't wait all night for the music.
go.
you have to pay anyway.
i'm a fraud.
i'm the worst faggot of all time
i'm a lying, vicious, ruthless whore.
i'm a contradiction.
contradictions aren't supposed to be
they can always be explained by something we're not ready to face.
so it's better to not run from them, face them, see where they can lead us.
because most contradictions are what we're looking for.
put your hands on your stomach.
close your eyes.
let's all breathe together.
inhale...
breathe, breathe.
i thought it was my pregnancy, but i thought it was me.
we all have contradictions.
they're in the function of the first step to understand what we want or don't want in life.
the one who limits you but you worship?
i broke the machine on purpose to get there again.
i broke it.
the one that you prayed but repressed?
what you're pushing but keep you free?
who set you free but condemned you?
who tempts you but you love?
what is it you refuse but love?
because you want to, or are you just trying to keep pretending everything's okay?
society wants you to be fat.
if you're fat, everyone will feel better because they feel superior.
not anymore.
it's time to take the first step.
stick to the reins of your life.
one move can change dynamics.
but one day of enthusiasm, one bottle of kilo-away isn't
kilo-away doesn't work miracles.
it gives you the support you need on the long and difficult path of success.
believe me, there's only one way to succeed.
step two.
white, pure and clean.
00 kilos lighter.
it's almost dark brown shit color
00 kilos lighter.
once again, i beat the happy nun.
shall we choose a blossoming blossom, an astronaut, a tropical bird living in the amazon?
i don't like big tits.
let's see
you have more glucose levels.
it's not exactly pathological, but you have to be careful
you could be a diabetic on pregnancy.
your blood pressure's up.
after what you said, it's not odd at all
don't worry, paula.
everything's gonna be fine.
just be careful what you eat.
if you hadn't always been with that girl...
what?
nothing.
what are you doing, bigfoot?
blood, hair, fingernails, body fluids, etc.
it's a sample that's confused with the proctivial enzymes and the separatists to isolate the dna
years ago this process was buying for weeks.
today's machine can be done in less than 00 hours.
i mean, i'm half the
we're pairs of twins, so the last 0 digits... these and these... should match.
i wasn't trapped.
i even had a very nice boyfriend.
the thing is, he wasn't from the
i tried to get him into the community, but he wasn't very interested in spiritual things.
i mean, he didn't want to stay a virgin until he got
he got sick of waiting and left me.
i was depressed, but then alex came.
actually, alex was always there.
two eggs, fried rice, shrimp noodles and moo shu pork.
do you have fries?
a reception.
i want a salad with bean sprout.
i got really fat when i started dating alex.
i can still examine another size.
why?
you gotta eat, you're big bones.
that's why i brought you to a chinese restaurant.
let me eat what i want.
it won't work.
what happened to your cousin who lost a kilo to get to the gym
look, he's more fat than he used to
cover yourself, sofia, for god'
that's what girls wear.
how long?
come on, you like it.
of course you do.
you like it.
you always do your own thing.
you're forcing me to make a scene.
i'm not hungry any
you like what you did?
you've lost my appetite.
it's really, really...
you're such a rebel.
how can i eat more than you without getting weight?
i looked around and all i could find were pictures of you two fat assholes.
you've been out of normal, and your sister was a little heavier.
that fat bitch ruined my life from the beginning.
you have a lot of baby pictures.
i only found one.
and i was 0 years old there.
being adopted doesn't matter that much.
family is not biological, it's an emotional matter
stop teasing me!
don't say things like that
i'm gonna freak out and leave the house.
thank god.
luis, you're not adopted.
what about dna test?
if it was properly applied, of course.
nuria probably forgot to make hybrids of the samples.
i did, i put them in the thermomix steam cycle.
how did you transfer the fragments to the nitro cellular damage?
i wrapped the aluminum foil and held it at the center temperature for 00 minutes.
ten out of ten.
how did he do it
thanks to what?
thanks to me.
pilar, i'm rehearsing.
so i can fuck you.
it's good that you think about my anal needs.
you don't like
of course i like it.
it's a nice big
want to give it a try?
this is our routine now.
we bring him chocolates, but since he's clearly unable to eat, we're eating.
then i throw up.
then we share a film, a super height.
then i throw up super.
then dinner, some champagne, a nice view... a nice view...
and i... vomit.
then it consoles me.
then i comfort her.
i'll die!
why do you think you throw up so much?
i've come to conclude that the food isn't in my body for some reason.
my digestive followed his normal course, but suddenly he's working backwards.
i know what you're thinking, therapist.
aren't you sick of this shit?
aren't you tired of reality?
my life is normal for the first time
just like i know you came here to justify yourself to keep eating like a pig.
he's condemning a man who doesn't deserve him
what's up, paula
what's that
you tell me.
we can discuss this later.
no, we'll discuss it now.
i don't care!
it's your fault i'm unhappy
is that how he treats you?
does he throw your food in the trash?
does it make you feel like shit?
or is it just me?
explain to me why you don't love me, you don't like me, that i make you sick!
you don't know how much i hate you.
and you look after your fucking kids.
now we've learned your shit, therapist.
" and the light has come to earth
'cause the bad things that do bad things are avoiding the light, and they hide it from it, that they may not
wait, wait.
what are you doing?
go ahead.
my turn, not yours.
your turn for what?
since when do you have more than one orgasm?
first you wanted to be on top, now you want to be an orgasm twice.
what next?
i don't know, we'll
were you touching yourself?
is that why you stay in the bathroom so long?
stop it.
are you crazy?
don't mess with me.
come here.
don't be st
you made me do everything!
damn!
look how pissed me off.
you think i like being like this?
look how i've been.
you think that's good?
look, sofia.
look at me.
you think i want this?
no, my love.
i look at you, you look dirty.
dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty
you... you
fucking device.
what are you doing?
i'm trying to get it
drowning it won't work.
tell me the truth, dad.
i want to know the truth.
just because you're weak doesn't mean you
you're gross, fat and ugly but you're smart, like my mother, like nuria.
you always treat me like a fool.
i'm not sleeping with this shitty family.
okay, i'll repeat the test to prove it to you.
but luis, you're so smart.
there's nothing stupid about your body.
what the hell are you doing?
i need it for the test.
i have to cut off the hair of his balls.
what a smart son i have!
i've been with you for ten years.
as soon as something starts to hard?
or is that too hard?
am i the hard one?
the therapist who treats fat people can't stand the appearance of his fat wife.
you brought your job home.
look at me.
you can't even look at me.
you don't like me anymore?
tell me.
tell me what's hard for me.
i don't want to look at you
i love you with all my heart and i can't think of a life without you.
like i'm the most retarded person in the world.
because you are.
it's called "ashka letters. "
"my lord asked jesus,
'how can a drunk man be born?
judah 0 is 0
it's the part i wrote.
"soofi, i know i'm not gonna be born again, so i can't go back in time to fix my mistakes
all i can do is learn from them to be stronger and not repeat them.
you're the person i want to be better and be happy with.
i want to go on the road to adventure and salvation together.
alex.
deal?
yeah, deal.
will everything be the same?
it'll be the same.
no sex until the wedding.
what about my orgasms?
okay.
and you'll get fat again.
what?
you said - everything will be the same.
don't i look better now?
of course you do.
that's why i said it.
to keep us from following the devil.
asshole!
all this time you've pulled me down, made me think i can't do any better.
i'm ashamed to be with you.
i'm glad this happened today because i realized i never wanted to see you again.
dirty!
jesus?
i'm sorry, jesus.
who, you or me first?
you.
leave me, leave me, leave me!
i abandoned him.
i love you, but i don't love you.
these relationships make a lot of addiction.
we decided to stay friends.
and we were together when we agreed on that.
it was typical goodbye sex.
i wasn't fat.
and charming.
and fierce.
my doubts have begun.
maybe breaking up wasn't a good idea
we decided to be together.
every night, the insomnia and the concern came back.
he wasn't there to comfort me.
i felt so awful that i came to therapy on the wrong day.
sorry, i think i got the wrong time.
the clock isn't wrong, it
i came to the bar.
i didn't want to go home.
suddenly i realized a man was always looking at me.
i thought you were amazing how fat i was and i wanted to get up.
i asked the waiter for the bill, but he said the guy paid for my drink.
i don't know how, the guy showed up with me.
we were drinking whisky instead of coffee.
he kept telling me how beautiful i was and it wasn't bad.
and then i remembered what i said about trying new things, experience with other men, and i found myself in need of consolation... and consolation... and
that's how i met the second guy i ever fucked until then.
what can i say?
it was better than any therapy session.
i was desired, not fat.
of course the following week it feels fat and gross and i couldn't stop eating.
i was supposed to be consoled...
i was supposed to be consoled well.
that's how i met the third man i ever fucked until then.
but something made me feel like you wouldn't approve of my behavior.
your idea may not mean a lot to me, but i guess i wasn't ready to hear it
let's go.
where?
to london to meet your wife and children.
where did you think?
that's how i met the fourth man i've ever slept with.
it was as handsome as the second and third, and a happy marriage.
so i decided to keep sleeping with handsome, married men for three reasons.
i didn't want to get attached.
i was convinced this morning it would never happen again.
what convinced you?
german coming back.
i guess that's why i slept with all those guys
i thought it would be easier to forget german.
if he didn't leave because i lost 000 pounds, maybe he would've left because i slept with 00 men.
you see, there's something i've decided to go after.
what did you decide to go after?
i don't
i don't even know if i should ask you to help me or to fuck me.
or help me by fucking me.
because you're handsome and i know you're married
what about you, what's up?
jesus!
i loved you so much!
paula!
pregnant lady, are you there?
the ice cream is melting!
paula!
hi, i'm abel.
i didn't understand why men with handsome and happy marriage want to sleep with a fat woman.
i was wondering.
until one day i stop worrying.
so don't worry, i won't ask.
what's wrong?
you ruined everything.
everything.
luis, it was a joke.
if i let your jokes affect me like that, i'd have killed myself already.
i'm glad you're not my big-ass twin sister.
stop talking.
of course we're twins.
not if our fathers are different.
what?
twins are different fathers of twins.
you screwed up good this time!
tell me who it is!
say it!
say it!
what's going on
what's going on here?
tell him who the father is.
you're my father.
at least tell him!
tell him who you are!
he deserves to know who the father is
tell her who she fucked instead of me!
i've been with you my whole life!
i've come to this shitty life!
hi, i'm abel.
please come.
i'm so scared.
what are you doing, pilar?
i'm trying to put on your wedding ring, but i can'
when he was in a coma, he
forget it.
listen to me.
go home and take one of those sleeping pills with a glass of warm milk.
you're emotionally worn out.
what are you doing?
let me try.
he would have liked it.
marry me.
what do you say, pilar?
from the funeral straight to the wedding?
you should think about it.
i've been thinking about it for a
marry me, please.
why would a fine-looking, intelligent, loving woman marry a gay?
i mean, with me
i don't understand
my love for you is true.
i don't even know if you love me a little bit.
i live for you.
just for you.
marry me.
the video is uploading.
"fats are fucking up. "
i never expected you to be perfect for 00 years because you were.
you were perfect for me.
we were perfect for each other.
we had everything.
i know this could happen once in a lifetime
i'll be in the hospital for three days.
when i get out of here, i want you to be leaving the house.
you know, more than anything else is bad.
today we're discussing the role of the woman and the man in
it may seem very obvious, but it's more deceiving than you think.
no, my love... my love...
please, don't... ple
don't go
come, pray with me!
sofia, what's wrong with
somebody do something.
please!
you must do it yourself.
but the only thing you can trust is yourself.
and only you will taste victory.
step one step
i never took care of my children.
they were even intruders who were there just to get headaches and curfew.
the thing is, what if one of them isn't
i shouldn't mind, should i?
i should be glad.
i turned 00 yesterday.
i didn't think i'd live that long.
i wasn't wrong, either
even if i die, i can't lose weight
i spent six months in a tent, obsessing about finding nuria's real father.
i ran dna tests on our family, friends, neighbors.
i even got a sample from my deceased brother fede, who took long walks with beatriz after lunch when we spent sundays in the country.
