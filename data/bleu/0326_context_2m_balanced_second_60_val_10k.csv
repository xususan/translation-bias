i'll tell you
i need to write an essay that's the moral side of war... and that's at least 000 words that can prevent a conflict coming out of a conflict
i'm not sure you'd appreciate me cheating on our moral teacher when i'm writing
so you passed my ethics test.
in fact, he was desperate hopelessly into his teacher... desperate, burnt her sister, who had the crush, hopeless
small crimes can be severely cut off... even the hands of the people who commit harassment

why am i telling you this?
i guess there's some things you can't tell your dad
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set up his father with his father to help her handle her mother's duties for her mother.
there's nothing wrong with that. that
but i still have to tell you that i'm a little bit cracked because you don't think me for it.
and a state of that could function the state halls
teachers can do this job as well as the teachers can

i mean, she's old for you, don't you think she's old?
we don't even know how old she's
nobody knows no
he's all these different dances with the young girls, and i thought maybe i'd go up to him and, uh, do something like
"hey, you want to dance?"
and he'd be, like, "what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it differ different in front of the mirror,
but, you know, like, we were, like, dancing confusing jokes or doing something else.
i didn't think that in detail like that.
don't you think you should date someone your own age?
like your cousin your cousin

very impressive very impress very impress

just this part, impressive?
and then we take each core of each egg with a needle at a need
there's too much need needle in cloning cloning
we're gonna put the dna extracted eggs next to the transmitter cell next to the
so that's cindy's cell in her
and we're energizing energy

we're doing a bit of heat shock, like some kind of electricity

no, that's very impressive.
