michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, his brother, buster, whom he shared his bed.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i will.
i have to write an essay of at least 000 words... about the morality of war and the possibility of a conflict.
i'm not sure our moral teacher would like me to cheat while writing a trial.
so, you passed my moral test.
as a matter of fact, he burned the sister, desperately, desperate for her teacher, bethbaerly.
even the hands of men who commit small crimes can be blown to shreds.
he doesn't have a ring no ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
it was right on us.
your father thought it would make us look better.
he must have imitated my signature.
"maybe a year ago, i'll have a son who finished sinking cheese!
you must save me from this.
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't look at him either.
i don't have a mother's compassion and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i give you olive branch here.
yes.
by the way, when did you sleep with anyone?
meanwhile, lindsay was giving george michael her homework.
why i'm telling you this.
i guess it's because there are things that people can't tell their father.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to arrange his teacher to set up his father... so he could be his mother.
there's nothing wrong with that.
however, i must explain to you that i've been a little broken since you didn't think of me for this.
the stills can do this mission.
teachers can do that.
surely, someday, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay was never so proud of what she said her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i keep telling you.
she's really... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
you have a moustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache.
yeah.
but gob misunderstood the sentimental interest in michael's kindness... and felt he was competition to interfere.
because, you know, beyond affection... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
_
and george sr was about to visit a surprise visit.
i read all your teachings and got all your tapes.
and i watched them all again.
george s.r. recently released a series of suggestions... to make money from the spiritual spirit... to make money from the soul he'd discovered.
i also lost two kilos of your banana bluth jail bar.
i came to find out where you were.
this is a nice place to start.
and michael met lindsay at the parent-teacher night after she got rid of the two girls she was dating.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this place have the same plan as our kitchen floor?
i think she's really good for you.
i'd think it would make him think of his motherhood.
besides, i can't rush into a job like this just because my son wants me to and marry someone.
this is mrs. baerly, the moral teacher.
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life... that can be destroyed without a reckless trigger.
and michael got to know his son's moral teacher.
that's the "rrrr."
you know, so annoying.
i mean, after mr. daniels had a stroke, they gave me this class.
i thought you were kidding.
no, i was just laughing because you laughed.
"rrrr!" - "rrrrr!"!
but, you know,
and i think i'm moral.
yeah.
a question for you.
could a parent-teacher invite a drink?
or...
yeah, he's dead.
i think it's because of this mr. daniels disaster...
let's go have a drink.
yeah, maybe it'll help.
george is dealing with his own fan.
i've already told you many sins.
maybe you'll tell me some of your sins.
well, there are legal shows showing my sins.
but, back to your sins.
tell me one of those things about... one of the things that happened in the university dormitory.
and what's going on with michael today's second date on his date with mrs. bayerly...
michael, that little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with him.
at least, i think it's him.
you have to rob her to freeze to say something definite.
yes, mother.
they'll take her back.
don't take your shoes off, little man!
don't take your shoes off!
out of control.
who is it?
it's "annong," your father and i adopted it.
what, i'm leaving for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille buster noticed he was worried, even jealous.
and he figured out what it feels like to be ignored.
annyong is your sister's your sister now your sister's
cancel.
he stays.
listen, i'll call you back.
good ride.
are you making reservations for dinner?
he made a "fak korean."
and after the dates...
michael took a step he hadn't thrown in years.
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we sneak in without waking everyone up?
this may not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i loved.
i took someone you love.
i'm "nashbagerlajam"
listen, i know you're trying to get revenge on the whole marta thing.
i was lying to you, so...
he has to accept it.
i don't think there's any problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i'm really lucky i got rid of him.
no problem.
very romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i must say i didn't know it was real first.
but now... your moral teacher...
yeah, i did it for her.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm pretty sure you're interested in him.
i'm sure you don't like sadam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to her to show her that i care about her.
about his class?
i mean, she loved him...
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with him.
well, why did he do that?
why did she sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new...
he's not one of the good snipers targeting his target, and he's almost everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think that he was...?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think she's old?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
she was accompanying young girls in different dances... and i was kind of a joke, so i thought i'd go and do something...
"hi, do you wanna dance?"
and she's like, i thought, "what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it differently across the mirror, but...
but, you know, it's, uh, we're dancing with a joke or something.
i didn't think so detailed.
don't you think you should go out with someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've proven a difficult book that was found in the bath suite of saddamas disappointment.
"what would my mistad?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, here's the same fire escape.
in jail, george sr was preparing for my evening with his most loyal fan.
when cindi lightballoon makes his own preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and when george michael was still angry with gob, he went looking for the family expert on making trouble.
i know you're dating shannon.
that cheerleader?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different dances.
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr daniels, and i asked him... but he was breathing, and he dropped the phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe i should go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hello.
my mother took him.
he's got me registered to do school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the situation with miss bearly and george michael.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
i want to talk to you about that.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality...
see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's, like, in love with you, so...
he knows we're out.
i told her you slept with my brother.
this could be the most immoral thing i've ever heard.
well, you're just a half-term moral teacher.
look, it was a hunch.
my brother was gonna try to sleep with you.
so, i want to leave you right now, and i'm not going back to you.
i see.
from now on.
she went for a walk with george scrandi.
george.
and she's getting to know him.
you can spill your heart out here completely.
it weights on my soul.
you...
he's picking up the camera.
i'm taking grandmother to the dance, which means your dinner's away with mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy.
watch your back, my immigration little brother!
and the different spring dances were at the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting him in because he doesn't have strong square jaws... with his perfectly flawed nose, like you.
do you want to dance?
all right!
he finally found the shannon he was looking for...
gobun found out he was cheating on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i ruined our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about it for a long time, and-ve...
that's... that's your right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, with my moral teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my moral teacher.
after you've been so bad to you, you've been really worried about protecting me.
actually, gob mistook michael's morality teacher for citizen's citizenship.
man, the type... he understood.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a teacher of citizenship.
second move.
i've been seeing mrs. baerly, and i should never have dragged gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to this.
we're open to this.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed on some sad things, but...
i don't think we'll have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm getting this cake.
hey, you wanna dance?
i can't believe this is working.
next arrested in developement.
buster's pull is sore.
stop, stop, stop!
no candles here.
mom's going crazy.
no, it's okay.
i light my candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
no problem.
right here, let me help you.
these?
okay, i'll move it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is something really extreme.
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
ok!
ok!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we all go one day, right?
four months ago, each of you joined an interview to join a never-before-seen tv show.
and guess what?
you win.
i think some people came to life on tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm a real gay guy and i'm proud of it.
you're so sweet, aren't you?
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel from england.
me too.
that's my brother stanton, my parole officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit her head.
she doesn't know.
but i do.
dixon, 0:00, 00 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they look like barack obama these days.
each of you will make $00,000, all you have to do is spend one night in this prison.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
damn!
cool.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know if this is a prank?
right.
it's our third show, but we're not gonna publish until the fall.
to find out if this is a prank, you're gonna have to play and earn the money.
you'll be asked to perform a series of duty.
the missions will force your borders, your courage and thought.
that sounds fun, right?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make up your mind now.
i'm in.
where am i signing?
i didn't have a girlfriend to admit it even when she was high.
i have to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are insane.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
come around.
you'll notice.
the money will be spent equally in the survival of the survivors, but if you all take the night out, there's a wealthy prize.
no money can spend the night here.
anyone else want to join him?
not me.
there's no way i'm gonna go to the city with this piss boy with this
i'm in.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you guys are idiots.
it's a fucking party joke, they're all gonna fuck with you.
you don't look anything but a bunch of idiots.
can't you see it's a party taken off this rock?
or we'll be famous.
there's a human head!
don't worry, it's not real.
it seemed pretty real to me.
that's why they call us special effects.
isn't that nice?
a little sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thanks to our reward special effects team.
follow me, friends.
in hot swamp water, lazy crocodiles are waiting for their prey.
the indian crocodiles are long and benevolent.
such crocodators...
guys.
i see you work as hard as ever.
ready?
we're all set.
and exactly.
keep this up.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great that you scared them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are gonna join the show.
you really looked like you were scared.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really gives me the creeps.
did you know that?
homeless ones?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
that must be a big coincidence.
you think it's really safe there?
it's safe enough for show insurance.
any more questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're rolling.
each of you has been chosen by your own free will to win $00,000 a night in prison.
isn't that clear?
all right, let's get this party started.
you can find everything you need at your base camp, that's the director's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe somebody should write it down.
but how can we write?
go down the hall, turn right, right, then left.
straight down the stairs, left, right, and another left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
there you will find a key to get rid of your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought it was awful getting out of the basement.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to the mission.
could you not do that?
i can't see shit here.
anybody remember where we're going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, twice right, then left.
there was too much going on.
no, go straight down the hall, no, no, down the hall, down the
"turn around, make it right again, and left."
"then straight down the stairs,
"sola, right, and left" again."
what are you?
smart.
illet, it's gonna be a great show.
careful.
careful.
jesus.
what is this place?
and get ready.
that was fun.
let's speed them up a bit.
okay, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
the power's running out, the generator should've taken over.
damn it!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's freezing here.
look, the key.
yeah.
okay.
look, guys.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think so, director.
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what, man?
"hi, brave contestants.
"welcome to clem harvis' office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room.
"this chess rocks will determine your personal role.
"you cannot change your rocks with other contestants.
"the rays were her favorite."
now it's your turn to put your hand in the box.
shit.
well, who wants first?
ben.
what's going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black rook.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
damn!
that was a real freak.
welcome to my little piggies, mission.
now let me tell you about the pennyville state prison.
in 0000, during the crisis, when the cost went up, the ruthless warden thought he'd increase his fortune by destroying some expenses.
these were prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the director's crimes were released.
the last person to be sentenced to death here was principal harvis himself.
rumor has it that the director is still out here in the halls.
you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured souls under this building tonight.
first mission.
your white queen.
try not to die!
anyone want to change?
no!
okay.
"the white queen must go to jail's church to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first corridor.
that sounds great.
thanks.
damn it!
what happened?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, relax, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung the babies!
kids...
i think they've got the whole thing covered with speakerons.
the voices are more efficient than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
jesus!
that sounds lovely.
no, i'm fine, man.
freak.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
there's a sound.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're calling from the speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off the flashlight.
okay?
open the marked page from the bible...
"you will find the lord's prayer there.
"a disrespect for this place that was sacred 00 years ago,
"now this is the chamber of extraordinary events."
oh... "the opposite."
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do this.
"when you complete your mission...
"if there's no sign of the director,
"you can go back to camp."
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry about who i'm bothering.
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
" protect us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"never let evil rule us.
"keep us out of the way...
"give us our debts as we forgive those who owe us.
"give us our daily bread today.
"as in heaven...
"as in the sky,
"because domination and domination are yours."
please tell me i can go now.
"before i go camping"
jesus, randall, you have to blow out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there a minute.
look what's done for the money.
where'd he go?
from what i understand, the people who did this, they cut off our connection to our homo friend for a while to give us a more frightening air into the business.
whatever.
definitely, it's gone.
guys?
i think we did something awesome.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, man, it's not that bad.
definitely not worth the money.
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it again.
they can serve you again.
no kidding.
i swear you don't even know how you feel there.
it's as if you're walking in the busy fog, it's just as cold as ice.
creepy.
is it just me, or is it cooler here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next time.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated.
let's send scelzi down and check it out, you're on.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
either talk or i'm gonna go.
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i had a little research done.
you mean the girls from the town you slept with when you said "don't fuck"?
am i right?
big lips, wide hips, taylor.
okay, prison isn't just for men?
were there any women in the department?
and that fucking crazy director wouldn't answer anybody if she was naked around the women's department.
beat them, rape them, get them pregnant, and starve to death.
some people call themselves their babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this real story will increase interest in the show!
everyone might be talking about us.
that's nothing compared to the story you made up.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do this, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
yeah?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they do.
good.
scelzi, what is that?
it's just a little something to get me out of the night.
want some?
now, get your hairy ass over here, okay?
aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the hell out of me.
i've got a great stuff.
suit yourself.
we're fully prepared to begin.
i can tell you my biggest fear is being buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will lead you to freedom."
okay,
at the end of freedom.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
damn!
what?
blood.
it's not real blood.
no swears, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs aren't below, you're upstairs.
i'm sorry.
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down, you're gonna see a door with a finger.
he says...
damn it!
welcome to cell number five.
"if we consider the violence and the madness,
shit.
tell me what to do... and i'll get out of this hell.
no!
thanks.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a prisoner can't commit suicide,
"now you'll be punished for a prisoner."
okay, where's the hole?
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult mission.
"what will you do when you're in the hole."
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my mission.
connie.
what?
check this out.
what?
no...
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back, and i specifically told you something, and you ask me why you were fired?
this is not our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you have to take that guy out, okay?
she's gonna screw up the show.
damn it!
we'll be ruined.
so you didn't bring this?
cut it out, no.
very clear.
what's open?
come closer.
i asked you why you put a camera in the control room.
yeah.
the camera footage... they want to record...
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
genius, right?
definitely brilliant.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to take us to the record how he scares us by putting things in the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you could reschedule.
that's busty.
okay, black king and white horse go right and go to the gas chamber.
white queen and black horse go straight, and go to the jail kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"beg and the left and then right.
"go and ride down the hall,
"and get down the stairs."
scelzi, answer me.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, pick up.
we're in.
"welcome to the gathering room.
there must be a light in the wall behind you, open it.
"black king and white horse go into the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
that place deserved the best, it's a real place.
it's the only place the legal department cleaned up.
beautiful, isn't it?
it's scary.
jesus.
what's that smell?
a documented true execution rooms often carry the smell of death itself.
of course, the smell is not death.
if a man knows his last moments of his life, his last worry about the radius that smells a lot of stuff that stinks.
in that case, the smell of the human smell that we breathe is the smell of gas that kills him.
now for fun, ladies and gentlemen.
the black king is sitting in the chair.
black king?
that's me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you will find some meat and a chick.
"you'll eat this beef."
man!
the prisoners are always eaten meat, pig...
"...or there is no lamb or another meat...
"and they suspected it was happening.
"they thought they'd never tasted before."
you mean human flesh, right?
are you in?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i gave up.
you're gonna tie toni up.
i'm transferring you from here, toni, before the gas is released, the fear of the prisoners must completely live.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends have strange wishes.
are you okay?
okay.
"your duty teammate...
"to find the main van and cut the gas before it kills."
you should watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to throw up.
okay.
strange.
i can't do this.
i can't.
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
"no more tricks."
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they'll pay for extra money."
do it for the team, girl.
are you gonna throw up?
thanks.
okay, angel, i'm at the bottom of the stairs.
shit!
can you hear me?
he's back.
it really stinks.
let me out.
come on.
get me out, man.
jesus!
who's the man standing there?
cheeky.
muscular.
let me out.
i don't know, con. this guy's starting to freak me out.

let me out.
how's it going?
we need to talk to you.

yeah.
i have big news.
i think the company's playing with us.

who's there?
who are you?

and what are we gonna do with the castle teller?
where are they?
i don't know, just give me a few seconds.
there.
did you see that man again?
wow!
who's that?
okay, how did he get here so fast?
isn't that the guy in the picture?
yeah.
yeah, she looks like him.
nice.
no, not cool.
this guy either gets through walls, or there's more than one man.
we've all been watching "prudioj," haven't we?
mind if we pass?
please?
guys?
guys?
fake blood, fake.
they did good.
maybe even oscar.
no.
no, that's not true.
it's completely out of the script.
sounds real to me.
connie, they're playing with us.
trust me.
what?
hey.
they copied his picture.
what?
acting.
clothes.
easy.
stop.
no.
no.
he's a real ghost.
i can't turn any more.
if it gets any further, it'll be out of sight.
what?
this is a big jail.
i can't put cameras everywhere.
show me the pit.
show me the gas chamber.
taylor, someone's got to go over there and see if they're okay.
i can tell you they don't look good.
he's acting.
where's scelzi then?
i don't know.
probably hiding somewhere.
i'll call the office.
okay, you too.
good night.
they don't know what happened.
i feel bad.
okay, i'll go and prove it to you.
no problem.
anyone?
i'm coming.
i'll get my camera, maybe i'll get a good look.
thank you.
you have to be nice to them.
you're gonna get it!
"you're gonna take care."
you know what?
you really are photogenic.
you're funny, kid.
i want to do my duty now.
shut the air.
come on.
connie, what do you want to do?
stop the game.
wow, this place looks haunted, right?
it gets a little weird.
where did he go?
i don't know.
i didn't see him.
it's headed this way.
this won't come out.
what was that?
yeah, what was that?
shit.
taylor?
put angel on the screen.
we have to get them out of there.
can you hear me?
listen to me.
there's been some changes in the plan.
we need to stop the show.
what?
why?
i'll be honest with you.
there's another person with you.
who?
we're not sure.
i want you to get out of there as fast as possible, okay?
are you playing with me?
you're trying to scare me.
open the door.
i want to win and get my money.
open the door!
who opened the door?
sorry, you're not serious, are you?
idiot!
your mission is to memorize and find the location of the cellular cell seven.
lucky!
in this cell, the warden harvis was wounded deadly by a prisoner.
you're gonna find a key in that cell, this key will release your friend in the hole and the gas chamber.
great.
is that all?
it was the easiest money i ever made.
what am i afraid of?
nothing.
angel!
stanton?
help!
well, now it's out of my sight.
hello?
who's there?
hello?
angel?
angel.
let me down.
who are you?
angel?
angel!
what...
it's not real.
put me down.
wait.
it's you.
no!
angel, are you okay?
he killed my brother.
he's gonna kill me too.
he killed my brother.
new jersey school of acting.
not bad for someone like me, is it?
connie, are you there?
yeah.
how could you organize this?
we've been through a lot.
it's gonna be a great show.
i'll see you later.
first of all, do i take this shit out?
you're such a jerk.
you said you wanted a great show, right?
you got what you wanted.
yeah.
solve sei, i'll take dixon and stanton.
okay, snow, we're stopping now.
everyone get clean and change.

excellent acting.
show's over.
toni?
good job, dixon.
okay, dixon.
it's over, man.
are you okay?
stop playing, snow.
you gonna say something?
we have to get them out of there.
we have to get them out of there.
get it out of my face!
avenge new coordinates: 0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0
yes, atc.
i spy with my little eye starting with y.
if you can't understand, you'll lose as a punishment.
rain?
london, the package should have been in cia custody 00 minutes ago.
our air truck is waiting.
it's a good thing our guest didn't hurt.
traffic tower says they're moving in five minutes.
the home office's closets are exposed.
we're gonna need a little more creative about our fundraiser.
where the hell is oliver?
where's the flight protection image?
you can break the rules, but you need a special order.
something must be done.
director general.
i know you don't like hearing this from a politician, but reform is coming.
do you know that elevator is just for emergency?
guard 0, what's your status?
are you restless, juney?
you'd be less nervous if you just kept being my london boyfriend.
that position won't be open for long.
i spy with my little eyes that start with this letter...
the engines are going fast.
bring them on screen.
calum, closest police units?
whatever we got, come on.
code 0!
attack is happening!
jesus.
june, for god's sake, don't.
come on, now!
permission to use mortal power.
open the van or everyone dies!
open the truck, now!
pearce.
americans will crucify us.
your operation, harry.
say again, command center?
lower your weapons and release qasim.
what the fuck are you doing, harry?
open the gates!
open the gates!
come on, come on, come on!
command, the prisoner has escaped!
heading north!
no, no!
keaton!
the command center, the agent's chasing two on foot.
any other footage?
follow her.
the nearest armed unit is five minutes away.
the helicopter's 00 miles away.
barriers?
right.
the other side of the tunnel is the last one.
they have nowhere to go.
sco00 is five minutes away.
go.
agent 0, report.
ed, wait.
agent 0, report.
repeat, the cia liaison officer has been shot.
agent 0, do you see qasim?
command post, i heard a vehicle.
they shut everything down.
it's over.
the bbc can confirm that american terrorist leader adam qasim has escaped from mi0.
turns out the security convoy transporting qasim was attacked at the rack northolt route.
you're calling this a murder, not a war on the west streets.
because in new york, in washington, you didn't want that in london.
but pakistan's kids didn't want them either.
when they get shot by drone airplanes, they call it murder.
qasim offers a new kind of threat.
so far, he hasn't targeted civilians.
our models show 00% of the possibility of an attack within 00 hours.
the more pressure he gets under, the smaller the window.
i can't say that when the tape's been recorded...
the secretary of state is coming tomorrow.
we serve the british people, not washington.
if that's not true, we're already finished.
the americans think we don't serve the purpose anymore.
we need a head.
i'll be suspended in the morning.
have you heard anything about qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, what happens to me if you get out?
take it off.
nobody else knows you're in qasim's network.
just get out.
will holloway?
go.
how's life after mi0?
you're not from the moscow branch.
london needs you.
is there anyone you should say goodbye to?
thank you.
we know about harry's connection to your family, so we understand this may not be easy for you.
even if he's dead, it's okay.
harry's too arrogant to kill himself.
she was pretending to kill herself.
she went to her grave.
the love of your life.
harry's team has noticed a change in harry's attitude since she died.
she's emotionally distant, cold, started drinking too much alcohol.
water would be below 0 degrees.
he had hypothermia before he got to the bank.
this picture before you entered this land, this is the picture you said was taken after you jumped.
before he disappeared, harry made three encrypted phone calls.
your old emergency message box.
why did he call you?
i have no idea.
i talked to him the last time he took me out of mi0.
he wants to talk right now.
that makes you useful.
can you help us find her?
no, thanks.
and you, harry, talk a lot about berlin?
the night your father died?
if anything else, mace, i have a right to know.
i don't think i can...
if you're not really gonna kill him, i think you told me what you wanted to say.
find harry so you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
i thought i was taking this title to the grave.
recently, the anti-terrorist president of her majesty's security service.
funny, but who are you really?
these two words are someone who knows the importance of you.
asma shishani.
go.
how did you find me?
what do you want?
i know someone did it on my side.
they never told me who they were.
of course not, but you must have a connection.
it's a phone number, that's all.
the phone number works too.
in return, i'll give you what you want.
impossible.
he said he was a human rights lawyer.
your government helped them after i put my two brothers in jail.
but after i was released, she became too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if it's an agent, it's not one of us.
then don't be a problem, tell me again it's not worth anything to you.
keep her alive, this woman is the guarantee that i will keep my word.
i don't need guarantees.
take her to a hospital right now or the deal's off!
what she needs is mercy.
no!
she has a daughter.
and you sent him after me?
you put him in danger and now you refuse to save him from pain?
what the hell are you?
don't send video to her parents.
harry...
you have a deal.
according to the bbc, there's no progress in the capture of the escaped terrorist adam qasim.
the national threat level is critical, so there's an attack on the ear.
in the news of the economy, ftse 000 fell again this morning, the sterlin, the euros and the rest of the money.
there's a new intelligence about harry.
he's got a convulsive line that we're driving to kent coast.
holloway, this is classified information.
we found explosive marks there.
you've known him longer than all of us.
do you think it's possible that qasim could somehow get harry involved?
pull him in?
i don't know.
anyway, you find harry, we find qasim.
anything for holloway?
here you go.
tomorrow, 00.
salpa 0, show a, park in 0
then, open your eyes.
i hope you come alone.
just for protection.
we're seriously in trouble if you can't get a crazy cold war morphine.
i promise.
not yet.
until we see him, we're playing this game through harry's.
understood.
doors opening.
go.
the floor.
doors opening.
open interviews, multiple exits.
repeat, holloway.
things that harry needed to set up a meeting.
yes, mr. holloway, your uncle said he'd meet you at the coffee shop.
she left her cell phone at home.
the guy in the parking lot, get rid of him.
he'd be dressed as a mi0 shirt.
listen to me.
stop underestimating harry.
don't think you'll endanger your men.
wait for the signal...
what is it, alpha 0?
holloway?
holloway, where are you going?
wait.
no, there's no pattern.
don't move.
holloway, freeze!
terminal 0b.
doors closing.
he booked me a flight.
pa000, douglasow plane.
i'm going tolasgow.
call the douglasow office.
get me the airport police.
priority code sigma nine.
the police want an open road to the terminal.
and arrange permission for heathrow security.
pa000, passengers of the glasgow plane...
holloway, don't get in the air.
what am i doing here, harry?
i had to find someone i could trust outside the service.
this is a short list when you're drunk and dead.
to be honest, the only person i can call a friend is someone who thinks i ruined her life.
qasim's escape was set up by someone at the top of the service.
by one of the people who asked you to follow me.
that's why i had to disappear.
qasim had him.
he's our only connection to the traitor.
once she's in the system, she'll be silenced.
an attack is planning.
someone's trying to destroy themselves.
you're insane.
ruth's death...
don't!
look at you, that's all i want.
what are you waiting for, harry?
mi0 was everything to me, and you took it from me, for nothing.
hate me all you want, but i think you believe in the service.
what happened in berlin?
did they fool you like that?
this may not end as you wish.
i'm afraid i'm gonna have to tell them something about the lining of your jacket.
nothing there, but they'll have to check.
i'll send you a number.
call me in 00 hours, please.
i'm security services.
hands behind your back!
you just let her go.
calm down, francis.
we don't want you to have a heart attack.
the deadly one.
mi0 is a complete liability right now, and i'm the last friend of mi0.
so you have to be really good to me right now.
in other words, is he crazy?
that wouldn't contradict his last three psych evaluations.
she refused to join.
well, harry pearce didn't stop being.
as crazy as it is, i'll still catch him...
for example.
she asked me to help her disappear.
didn't it occur to you to accept your request and bring her to us?
don't think we're gonna be able to put your life in a shitter situation right now because harry's kicked you out of work.
since we threatened each other, all three of you, don't fall for the blood you're not swinging on the cliff.
your entire organization seems to be disposed of right now.
find qasim.
completely full.
they're ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i saw this name working on a case.
i thought they took you away from the mission.
they did.
now what really happened?
kidnapping may have been arranged by someone in the service.
do you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i left two weeks ago.
there must be one around here.
tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't apply.
when i was 00, i was hanging out with a kid who makes money transactions.
k episode was interested in some people using this, so they got to me.
you started as an agent?
and when i was done, they asked me to train as an officer.
when i told you, my parents returned to me.
and if someone you work for helped qasim escape, that would be a problem, right?
all right.
something felt wrong that day.
_
he told me not to open the gun compartment.
he ordered me to chase.
where does she live?
loaded.
w00.
panama city.
the service fund.
june, what are you...
who are you?
you told me not to chase qasim.
you told me not to chase it when i acted on my gun.
we swore one, rob.
i'm not saying anything until we get to thames house.
we're not going to thames house.
will, what did you find?
qasim's bodyguards were weakened from the safe.
the team leader was involved.
just a shoemaker.
find out who gave the order.
the americans think mi0. is weak link, and i think one of them is joining them.
when qasim ran away, we fell out of sight.
the cia is in full hands.
fire... fire... fire... fire...
he was gonna shoot.
his pulse...
dead, dead.
dead.
listen.
you should go home.
june!
i'll handle this, but you have to go, now.
i didn't hear a piece of this song was killed.
who's warrender's dirty shot?
landon miller.
agency hawk.
he's trying to get his continuing support and hope that he doesn't give us the keys to the kingdom.
every time i see you, francis, you look like you've been buried another inch or two in the secret places of a cow that went blind to langley or pentagon.
you don't have to tell me.
i don't think at times like these, we shouldn't forget whose flag hangs.
francis.
i'm trying to help, but he's totally accusing me of doing business for the cia.
tonight, your generals, politicians, your spies met for a celebration.
tonight, we attack the hearts of your powers.
our enemy, your sons and daughters, the politicians who have sent you to die in illegal wars.
spies who spy on you like you are guilty.
this war is beyond religious differences.
all the flights out of the united kingdom...
she had it.
warrender lived.
if you have access to qasim, tell me now.
there's another way.
qasim's wife.
asma shishani.
she's got the fsb.
if i find out where they're holding her, she gives the traitor.
you made a deal with him.
yeah.
and if we make it, it'll lead us right to him.
surrender and arrange.
how do you know she has the russians?
in exchange for a cia agent stuck in moscow.
i can get through, but you need to open the secret door.
it's a ip address.
you're kidding.
it's the only way, will.
harry's getting help from somewhere.
i've seized your old contacts, but i need access to personnel files to do this properly.
but it still won't take you anywhere exciting.
in position.
looks like i'm gonna have to steal more extra band width.
your drink.
malcolm?
all right, i'm in.
i'm looking at the server now.
harry, we gotta go.
can't we do this faster?
i can do it.
but unfortunately, this machine is the last century.
the g branch's already pulled these.
erin watts.
might be worth a closer look.
fill up some space for me.
but an agent was exposed.
i almost got him out.
i've been a colleague less than a year.
or they're making you choose late.
all right, i'll leave you alone.
ends?
why am i sure?
i'm sorry, will.
harry.
harry!
harry, what have you done?
stay away from the computer.
i don't feel like saying this before, but i hope you know what you're doing.
harry working with qasim?
a gchq stole the data archive.
everything we have on our west agent friends in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
_
i don't know.
harry didn't attack that cyber on his own.
then who's helping her?
except you.
and you still protect him.
why?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i'll find him.
and there's a threat.
according to analysis, there'll be a large scale attack within 00 hours, multiple targets.
an officer on qasim's escape is missing.
there are signs of struggle at home.
do you know anything about that?
how's your mother, holloway?
i heard it wasn't very good.
he hasn't packed since your father died.
understandable, really.
and then that door works.
i know, i know.
harry was right about something.
you're not good enough.
minister of internal affairs, can we really hope that qasim will stop attacking again?
we've destroyed threats to our freedom and our way of life.
your ability to hurt us may be important, but it's the end.
you'll find out that we have no limits.
they're not listening.
they never killed our women?
we're making the world a better place, brother.
the transplant team is in place at the airport.
we have a warrant by the atc to block the road to the prisoner when necessary.
i think i owe you.
you were absolutely right about vass.
danke.
alexanderplatz.
metron's northeast corner, 00:00.
we have a safe house.
call it nostalgia.
don't forget to bring the archive.
don't forget to bring your wife.
how did you find me?
there's only one place in berlin to meet.
you told me.
the northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
no emotional.
that's the price of qasim's wife.
when mrs. fsb comes out of custody, qasim will give me a number.
he's taking me to the renegade.
where it's safe to take that, they'll be able to destroy the service.
get in the car, harry.
there's an old hotel 00 minutes away.
my contact can meet us there with three clean passports.
you're going home.
sorry about that.
why are you here, mrs. keaton?
keep walking, harry.
i killed someone because of you.
you're c0.
what are you doing, harry?
talent monk.
so which one of you found it?
jesus, will.
everything is prepared.
and vass?
when he came to my house, i reported it.
i said someone was asking about qasim's escape.
they tied me to the command center, and they told me what to do.
they went to vass's house before us and planted the evidence.
i got vass to escape.
you think i want to do it?
i know my mission.
i'm the only one who knows.
you were set.
she's right, will.
but i wonder if mrs. keaton is sure about me.
it was a chain of command.
what was i supposed to do?
do you believe him?
yeah.
i'm sure your men will come and find you if your usefulness still stands.
what did you think they were gonna do to you after all this?
i did what they asked me to do.
we're changing the deal.
we're taking qasim's wife to london.
tell him he can't see his wife again, or else he'll never see her again.
let's go get her.
what happened to alexanderplatz?
sudden agoraphobia.
i'm afraid there was something wrong with qasim's wife.
at least work enough to put it in my car.
harry.
colonel.
i hate to be discreet, but we're gonna need your clothes.
while the search for adam qasim is concentrating on the search for the united kingdom's national rail line, everyone who's travelling has to show valid identification and must enter the governor's control.
i got your wife.
let me talk to him.
the russians put him to sleep and...
bullshit.
i'm bringing your wife to london.
no.
say good-bye to your bitch.
is the baby too much?
no, you're the same.
i trusted june.
you were right to take me off duty.
despite everything i've done, you're still trying to do something good here.
i won't let your sacrifice be for nothing.
it was here.
was it fast?
he could have left me, but he chose not to leave.
if you try anything, anything, i can't guarantee anyone's safety.
nobody.
you bring my wife, i'll give you your phone number.
here we go.
hello?
holloway.
this message came from the h department.
ben.
we can capture qasim, but i need help.
and let's go.
one clean choice, hannah.
trust me, and help me.
or go.
do good or good, right?
shit.
they're closing in.
what i wrote last night is an update from the self-replicating algorithm that keeps reviewing all potential looks.
well, then, it doesn't cut the water?
please.
all right, here we are.
how much time do we have?
i'm looking at 000 cameras.
give me something.
as soon as she realizes we're playing with her, she's gone.
wait.
she worked 00 seconds ago.
are you sure?
yes, verified.
the camera was disabled in the last minute.
third floor roof, east corner.
harry, we have to vote.
i really hope you're looking at us.
yes?
try the south.
i have his wife.
you're supposed to check south.
give me the number.
give me the number or we'll go.
turn around or you die.
here.
him too.
i haven't caught him yet.
you have 0 seconds to turn around.
turn.
maybe this man never saw her.
almost there.
him?
kill.
give me the number.
don't!
stop!
no!
okay?
will, she's fine.
the shooter's dead.
then it's over.
malcolm, feather.
yes?
my wife is dead, isn't she?
harry, listen.
hannah let us know.
harry?
hannah, why did harry take the earphones off?
i don't know.
let us know.
bring sco00.
0 trucks full of rdx are leaving porthouse north industrial park within the next 00 minutes.
how do you know?
qasim just told me.
the trucks are leaving in 00 minutes.
i think we got him.
let's go!
armed police!
stay where you are!
clear!
clear!
anyone seen the primary target?
negative!
negative!
negative, sir.
command center, area clear.
harry.
he sold his own men.
why would he do that?
what did you do?
armed police!
freeze!
move!
you have to tell them everything, harry.
i think we have a lot to talk about.
this might be a bit overwhelmed.
since the southwest corner of alexanderplatz.
keep your eyes on holloway.
make sure he's safe.
maybe we're not that hungry.
did you find qasim?
harry will talk.
you still don't know him.
qasim gave up his entire operation.
what did you say to him?
i should have thought they'd set you free after berlin.
they want to offer you a deal.
throw everything on harry and go.
i told them i'd quit after i did this.
there's no way out.
i can't.
there's an emergency backup key hanging around your neck.
whatever you're after...
what would ruth think?
what did you give him?
check the back.
southwest corner.
i found harry in the northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
the opposite.
where you trap someone.
harry?
i gave it to her.
get down!
get down!
get down!
lock us up.
get down!
get down!
we're not here for you!
we came for them.
get down!
think of your families.
hamza.
why?
there are 00 men on the other side of these doors.
you must surrender.
come here.
open up!
if you think we're negotiating...
open the door.
but he'll kill us.
there are too many demons in one room.
the only way out of here alive is to surrender...
you think i want out?
how many people have lived in this room?
the lives of my people.
your people?
you didn't ask them to kill you for them.
if you want a hostage...
i think he made it clear he wasn't interested in hostages.
i am the director of mi0.
kill me and put the gun down.
otherwise, you're nothing but a dead terrorist.
no one will see you as a hero.
when we're done, you're gonna be a drunk, tattooing your wife, a mighty heathen.
we'll give them free disneyland tickets to say you begged them to piss on a few marrakech male whores.
we can't remember you very well, can we, adam?
wait, wait, wait.
i took the helicopter back.
but...
you fucking coward.
i thought you fought a higher standard.
i'm sorry about your wife's death, adam.
i know what this can do to you.
is that supposed to stop me?
it's okay.
stop!
why did you bring him here?
i made a choice.
without plan b.
why do you think i kept you out of that room?
people are still dead, harry.
less than what's gonna die in the explosions.
how could you make such a choice?
this is my job.
auntie, can you come play outside?
hello, geraldine.
finally, it comes down to who says the long-term lie.
right?
if we had kept that morning, qasim would never have escaped.
you gave met's air unit an order to turn down all mi0 requests, right?
that's the advantage of being a maniac.
i don't have to prove it.
sacrifice his own services so he can be questioned by a foreign power.
the americans would have made you a general manager, no doubt.
how many more lives was that promotion worth?
what did you think you did, harry?
the service is dying.
but if i had given up on the losing side, my career would be too short.
blowing my brain and finding my 00-year-old nephew...
i think this came from you.
what is this?
the thin intestine intestines more than 0 hours, or it leads to unstoppable bleeding.
he won't leave a trace.
how clever.
i was afraid that would be the answer.
so i took your chance to choose.
it's not lunch that makes you sick.
i ate beef ribs.
tell me you're lying, harry.
please.
tell me you didn't betray your country.
it's been five hours, geraldine.
you can spend the last two hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd play with your beautiful niece.
i'm thinking.
your message said you'd tell me something.
they're watching ruth's grave.
you can't leave now.
i, too, have something to be you.
your father was wearing this the night he died.
he took out everything that could work, and he found a way to get into the fsb archive somewhere.
was she wearing a wedding ring on the night of her operation?
i didn't kick you out because you weren't good enough.
after your father, i couldn't...
i should have protected you.
not forever, will.
then who does?
they're like me.
if you know your problem and tell the men at the door, it'll help.
there's room for every guest in hotel middle school.
gather round in one row.
these new troubles kill in the dark.
these people will be grateful to you when it's dark.
i think we should keep them here to keep them safe, but i'm worried things get worse.
they have no idea who caused the dark problem.
and it's not what's hidden in the dark that we should worry about.
we still haven't figured out how to handle that fog wall yet.
maybe it's a blessing.
this was the last of in-flight safibi.
i'm on your side and i might need a new job.
i'm under control, but if i could get another pillow for my beauty sleep, it'd be very reasonable.
try to fix things.
we talked about this.
it's almost impossible to eliminate your problem before the problem kills someone.
of course, i just need stuff that's not available to me, materials that don't exist, and maybe not exist.
i'm gonna need a team.
any idea what happened?
but there's a bad element.
it's the only way to protect the rest of us.
it's risky to drive because of the magnet problem.
an engineer to help repair the power plant.
he volunteered as soon as he knew.
if things don't work out, you can use her problem for operator.
what the hell are you thinking?
the unsanctioned killer is out there somewhere.
besides, i think she wants to prove to you that she really wants to help.
okay, well, whatever the reason, just keep an eye on her for me, okay?
because neither of us has the immunity to new problems.
i'm not saying it's just mom.
i'll call the one who caused the dark trouble when you're gone.
he stole those batteries and put us in danger.
there was no other choice, dwight.
this is the third case in two weeks.
now the serial killer is in this building.
all right, i'm gonna go talk to dwight.
my father always said you were a good man.
mara's father?
there may be a way, but if you want me to explain it, it may seem more frightening, so don't ask.
even on the map, maine, i can't find haven.
are you telling me you can't find a town with 00 thousand population?
no problem with that.
then why didn't we use aher in the first place to end the problems?
i can't bring it with the seals sealed.
so how do we find him?
gloria brought a box of stuff that duke left in gull.
i don't think william has the amount i need, and aether is just the first phase.
you told his wife you'd find him.
it's easy to decide on the side, but sometimes it's not what it looks like
i have a town to protect.
no wonder the plant works at 00%.
guys, i'll try, but i've never done anything like this before.
they made the car parked here so i could talk to you, but i don't have enough money to pay the rink change.
if everything goes well, i'll be back with aether before sunset.
this is peggy's husband, rolf.
there's enough panic and fear.
the same killer who killed my son 00 years ago?
we call him the murderer who didn't leave a trace.
what else are you hiding from me, vince?
dwight's doing everything he can to make the rules agree, but he's not the type to kill people.
in this haven, banishment is the same thing.
thanks to our friend there, we keep them in some kind of prison.
he says the generator works at 00 percent.
damn, when the generator overloaded the energy reserves, it must have cleared out the reserves.
well, that explains the electrocution of the town.
at this rate, like, five minutes.
it's almost over, and it's the only thing that protects us from dying in the dark.
here, i've reconfigured the generator's arrangements to get the power to the town faster, but there's nothing more we can do.
they better get back.
help each other.
put the lights around you.
share your supplies.
you see, i'm happy here.
i got your message.
get in the car now.
come on, jump!
if the war lies ahead of us, we should be thankful, even with youan.
i don't think there's anything worse than being in love.
i don't like it here.
every story has two sides.
whoever's behind this is a traitor.
let's go.
he asked me to represent him at slean's wedding.
you are my brother's love.
that's why you're my brother.
you've seen bigger places than this place in the iraqis.
none of them were led by a woman.
you must choose a second person to escort you and watch your interests during the month.
then you will hear the bonds of friends and relatives.
i have no relatives here.
my mother and the others will accompany you.
kela, this is the palace of bregan.
rheda, must i always be protected?
i don't get it.
but i know i have to marry slean.
i'll love him.
this marriage can't happen.
abrecan trusts you.
what do you do?
carpenter.
then they can use you on the wall.
who are you?
a friend of the council.
like i said, i have work to take care of.
we need to figure out how to handle it.
varr said i couldn't accept presents.
well, it stays between us.
every bride should smell good when the wedding time comes.
remember, this is our secret.
sit down.
we'll get what we're gonna get while we look at the wounded.
you wanted to talk?
all right.
kela, it's your time.
elvina, will you be my second?
for the game.
we need to talk sometime.
we need to discuss reasons why marriage shouldn't work.
if we don't fulfill our mission, their marriage can be canceled.
beowful!
let's celebrate.
old tradition!
dress smells of perfume.
i'm so sorry.
it was just a little mistake.
that's all.
we're gonna help slean give the mark to his bride.
sounds easy.
break!
open the door!
come on, you stinking mudborn.
come on!
come on!
give me your arm.
come on!
slean.
quiet, kela's sleeping.
are they ready for this marriage?
i don't understand why slean didn't want to marry kela.
i don't think so.
put your feelings aside and do the best for everyone.
would you put anything aside for others?
that's all we have to do.
if someone delightes others, then that person doesn't actually live.
it must make a man feel pretty free to think that way.
try.
tell every rock the truth.
then you can look at each other and light the fire that simulates your marriage.
then you'll be husband and wife.
have you ever loved someone before?
no.
before you come here...
do you want to be thane?
tell my uncle i'm done with him.
yeah.
come on!
go!
you let him go.
we're not finished here yet.
don't you understand?
i betrayed my mother, and i had a pussy with my uncle.
this woman was sent here to kill you!
i don't know.
was it?
i killed my brother.
he was the one who should have been there today.
even without the world, mara had everything.
people loved her because she was kind.
my dad loved him as a first.
rowan and lovers.
then i had the chance to escape.
i didn't need anything.
she was dead before fever.
he was getting better.
i poisoned her.
slean, i'm not gonna tell anybody what you did here today and what happened.
or stay.
i know, but it's beowful.
she went to bed last night.
but we can choose who we can draw our fate with.
light the fire with me.
you want to be thane?
i can help you.
against what you see.
they can't take it from you anymore, rheda.
with this marriage, you're shields jarl.
these rules of jarl must be followed by every tribe.
a killer's life will be terminated if the blood doesn't pay.
thieves will be branded from society.
the price of all the merchandise in shieldlands will be identified by jarl.
what's the right to spot a fish price?
we're the ones who risk their lives just to catch a billboard.
you should have told me about the rules.
where your people needed you the most, you were on guard.
i couldn't distract you.
it was messy enough.
you're late for pandiri.
some people think you took her again.
but if you fail, bregan will be miserable and open the winter.
breca's wanted for murder, you know that.
kill him!
kill breca now!
i got it!
you do that without any explanation, we all die.
after she escaped the gallows, she hired us to deliver breca into her blood.
did we ask the guy who helped him escape the first time?
that's why we'll welcome it.
but we should keep breca.
heorot can stand our gates as we speak!
when did we kill young women?
what do you mean?
you've been hiding in the shadows too long, abrecan.
remember who you're talking to.
talk.
the boy wants breca's life or blood money for his brother's murder.
i didn't mean to kill anyone.
hurry!
thanks.
breca made my mother fall in love.
he's looking for the widows he thinks he's got money, and then he steals the money, that son of a bitch.
he left my mother and took everything precious with him.
my brother went after you.
but it cost your life.
breca, is that true?
i'll pay for the boy's blood money.
lila, do you have 00 silver coins?
i don't want money, i want blood!
silence!
breca will be released if the blood money is paid.
you lied to me.
pandiri.
panel!
put him through.
get ready, they're coming.
i did.
get out!
council gathered.
she wants to take my place while i'm wasted on the bill.
you let me down, slean married keela, rheda jarl!
you don't understand.
tell the council our enemies are gathered, that your sister can't rule, that you want to save shields.
so tell me you're distracted.
tell me.
i'm sorry.
i knew breca killed someone, but the story she told me was different.
it's just her fault.
lila, no one would think bad things about you...
that's all i got.
did you bring it?
there are no 00 silver here.
not enough.
i'm gonna hold breca while i see that.
was there enough money?
lila?
please turn it off.
you won't talk to lila.
get on your horse, leave heorot and never come back.
there's no room for you here anymore.
if herot's going to be attacked, i want to fight properly.
if herot's attacked, i'll protect you.
let's try.
it's not about mudborn.
i don't want to talk about him.
i want to know why you lied about teaching me.
it hurts when you use it.
you don't even want to be spoiled.
yeah?
i didn't know we trained the ironmen!
go.
now!
fighting girls now?
the view was more like the blacksmith was training the huskarl.
i know you think i failed you.
that i couldn't focus on my duties in bregan.
but i have my reasons.
you're talking treason to one of your own.
we need a warrior in the center of this land!
someone who will take your people out of the darkness.
a man in power to take control!
you're talking about betraying your sister to hide the fact that you can't meet your people's needs.
what's the point of having fish if we're all being slaughtered?
i am here to vote insecurities for our thane.
the ones against abrecan being a thane.
decided.
a new thane will be thrown, and the morning will be announced.
get up.
next.
nobody.
don't think that's a game!
lazy, distracted.
this is gonna work here.
from now on, we'll work just like my father hrothgar.
i didn't mean to interrupt.
you're a good teacher.
a big thane wants a strong army behind it.
we don't have to share the same bed, but if we don't share the same room, people will start talking.
i always liked watching heorot from here.
it looks invincible.
if i tell mom the truth, i'll lose her trust.
and also my chance to rule one day.
what if abrecan attacks?
heorot may fall.
aren't you going to advise?
i trust you.
the decision you make is right.
i'll be with you when i'm done.
you'll be thane.
you just have to believe.
pandiri.
panel!
it's the bill!
play the horn!
i command you, play the horn!
abrecan, give up.
if we don't act now, we'll get the chance.
why... why...
you help me carry the net.
help me with the net now.
why don't you help me?
panel!
come on, hurry up!
go find me a sack.
people shouldn't leave their precious things anywhere.
you owe my mother an apology.
but i'm a warrior and our honor is at stake.
so i'll take your life.
go back to mommy, little girl.
greetings.
i didn't need your help.
because he didn't have enough money to save you.
be thankful you didn't kill him, vishka.
if we can't put the nets in, our prey will escape.
no, he's not.
get ready.
abrecan, no!
hold the rope steady!
hurry, they'll eat you raw!
pandiri, pandiri!
pandiri, pandiri!
hold on!
now get back!
check it out.
there will be songs about this hunt.
a hunt you won.
i have a dream about us.
being the biggest tribe in shieldlands!
we're not going to follow the laws of a jarl who can't even hold a sword.
who's with me?
abrecan, abrecan, abrecan!
i have to warn beowf.
bregan!
elvina!
the warriors are coming together.
to destroy us this time.
beowful!
if we look around today, we'll see more danger and more harm coming from religious beliefs.
my wife, stand-up shows that if i talked about soviet communism or stalin's savage, it'd be less embarrassed.
that's the situation, especially the philosophy, the kind of questioning the things that make trouble for people.
presenting a situation perfectly correct in itself can cause serious damage.
when the prophecy doesn't come true, we make fun of those people, and the whole world makes fun of us.
because of this problem with richard dawkins, i had fallen for a friendly idea.
maybe richard and i should be more aggressive.
especially america is shaking with christian faith.
they're sure the world is what their religion says.
we're gonna get rid of the bad guys.
i wish i could write a book like that, if i could.
but of course, one of my fears, what happens next.
what kind of chaos?
how true is it to do that to people who think that we're civilized, and that you're saving the good inside of us?
religion is like moragra for many people.
if that's true, if religion does lead people's moral lives, somebody's gonna have to go out there somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, somehow, you're gonna have to get your ass back on the floor.
because there may be a lot of people below, and we can make a chaos out of these people's fear.
many people want their lives to mean something, and where does that come from?
but something better than religion.
yeah, there's definitely hope.
let's see what happens.
of course.
at least you didn't get piercing.
i don't know how to explain this to amy.
i'm the stupidest man in the world.
all right, cut it out.
i'm the stupidest man in the world.
all right, you win this.
i can't find emma's papers.
honey, just so you know, even if you find the original receipt, you can't return the baby.
i need to find the paper that angela gave me when she left emma at my door.
finally, i'm gonna make health insurance for what i'm responsible for looking at myself and myself.
i haven't talked to her since the night we did emma.
easy.
you gave me all the important papers about the baby to keep them safe.
do you have all the paperwork?
her dad's little girl is a big girl.
could be a balloon thing.
that looks good!
you robbed a clown?
it's your birthday!
first of all, it's my birthday tomorrow.
you used to party all the time when you were a kid.
happy birthday after...
"happy birthday, miley."
you know those papers i had hidden for me?
how irresponsible do you think i am?
but i...
maybe i didn't post them on time, and she didn't post them, and i may not be the only owner of emma's attorney.
we were all excited about the new baby came, and i didn't have a stamp!
look, i don't mind if angela signed this paper again.
because you're ben's best friend and you're the only one who's seen her...
i like that, all right.
all right, emma finally slept.
hey, danny, what's the reason why riley didn't want to celebrate her birthday?
seriously, why does she hate so much?
ben, riley didn't celebrate her birthday after her 00-year-old party.
are you sure you want to watch this?
i think i'd remember if it was a disaster.
all right, come on, guys.
danny, where are we going?
luckily, the future where you win a real mustache and lose weight for one person.
am i here?
benjamin wheeler, come here and celebrate riley's birthday.
well, i can tell you that's the best birthday i've ever had.
tell the cake you didn't do anything.
actually, try to save it with the perm, then cut it out.
is riley still in love with ben or is that something that happened when she was a kid?
unless you're still in love with riley.
i ruined her sweet 00 party.
she's not in her birthday, but she loves you the rest of the time.
if ben is so irresponsible that he's gonna lose the papers and he's so afraid to confront me, maybe he doesn't deserve to take emma's attorney alone.
if it makes you feel any better, we do most of the work.
i can imagine how hard it was to leave emma.
i knew you'd end up hurting her if you thought she was funny or wonderful!
in your presence, in the city streets of the united states army, the chosen tank unit of the united states army, just three minutes, the slayla trooper 00th 00th 00th grade, 00
madox-00 is a high-powered combat capability in the limited areas of the weapon we remember.
moreover, a uh-00 has more catastrophic power than blackhawk.
both anti-terrorist and anti-gerilla operations.
miss kusumoto is also the chief architect of software for "tankbuster."
in order to expose madox's abilities with the bully, today's show personally passed to the pilot's cabin.
unit 0 will go to ichigaya tonight.
we're in a hurry, see how quickly we can get.
oh...
miss kusumoto, you humiliated me.
i didn't come here for congratulations.
there's one thing i tell you:
wow!
kouji...
what is it?
onose, you leave this to me!
they just throw away their trash.
i'm telling you, don't worry.
i'll buy you dinner for it, won't i?
sdf's transport car...
according to reports, it was very natural to meet this...
lazy terrorist thing.
you're a big stranger to the east-block operations.
i hope you know what you're saying!
i hope you see that the obligation of this incident is entirely yours.
either way, the situation we're in is critical.
we were transporting him for a field test!
state!
i have to make the operation.
besides, madox-00 is being overwhelmed right now.
we're having trouble investigating the crime scene.
shouldn't we get any support from the police?
we must prepare ourselves for the worst, and keep the help troops ready.
i'm the only one who can stand up to madox and keep an eye on him.
even though lieutenant kilgore is one of the worst, he is our best tankers in the army.
b- is this okay?
nobody in the apartment?
anyway, i'm a little relieved.
shiori was really pretty...
when he goes to reading england, all the boys in japan will mourn.
where did you learn that?
she called me in the morning and asked me to give you a message.
use the open control to open it up.
it burns!
he could arrange the pilot's cabin.
she feels like she's wearing a boat.
we got a signal activating from madison.
it's a disaster.
could you heat the microwave?
i really disgraced myself!
shiori, what do you mean?
defense forces?
you're on a mission with a prototype airlock tank.
don't you dare turn tokyo into vietnam!
tokyo ha vietnam is the same challenge for me.
you'll cause a disaster.
oh, don't worry.
i'm gonna get over it before things get too hot.
lieutenant kilgore is using the most advanced tank and anti-tank helicopter, and my word is to take madox to the mission.
in that case, there'll be big panic in the city.
in these circumstances, there must be someone who can stop kilgore and madox.
what can we do?
we don't know the madox's target yet.
if i managed to find her before ensign kilgore, then maybe i'm in the middle of a chance.
but the madox situation...
i'm using unit 0 with success from power tests.
how much chance?
hey, you heard me!
wait for me.
that's it!
how's it going!
what are you doing on the way?
i can't wait by the side of the road like a sidewalk!
you're a real driver, man!
i've got plenty more to finish your installments!
he's back in the cabrio!
bye, assholes!
oh, yeah, saturdays were closed for a car traffic.
i can't make a mark in this crowd!
that "madox" must be really valuable.
spider 0 to jackal 0.
don't move!
she's moving on herself...
one of the apaches was shot down.
all units are equipped to destroy madox.
just like kilgore wanted.
he's heading towards the skyscrapers with his apache.
the civilians must evacuate immediately!
they're coming at me!
i gotta go over there and use the west exit.
another armored crazier when he was standing!
all right, back to work, madox!
i hear you.
and i say, "you're a pain."
you're the one who caused the chaos.
just what?
none of your business.
i can't do something i don't know what it means!
no!
yes, captain!
"nsr parking spot" -
exit" exit" exit" exit"
i did it!
shiori's up!
i won't let you take another step.
i can't!
i can't waste any more time with you!
i thought you were amateur, so i shouldn't be nice to you.
time to jump around and stop jumping.
no job!
he's just a boy!
what were you trying to make of this?
my name is sugimoto kouji, the kantto institute of technology, the second grade student.
my only intention was to meet my girlfriend who was waiting for me at the nsr building.
first he locked me in, then dropped his own helicopter.
i got you.
miss kusumoto, spider 0 talk, i'm kilgore.
really, i watched your show.
you fight pretty hard.
i'll take care of whatever it takes, personally, if necessary.
hey, where are the civilians in the building?
what's so important?
why am i freaking out when i think of you?
madox is targeted.
he'll come after you to destroy him.
most of all, i know how to walk and use my hands.
you've got it.
either madox is destroyed, or you're kilgore!
they damaged my legs.
i can't move anymore.
you think i can beat him?
you were fine when we were fighting.
did you read the entire manual?
hey, madox.
adi it!
come kill me!
wouldn't you mind putting it up a little more and raise my taste?
l-lanet!
what is it, you're backwards like a turtle!
if you can't do this much, you're gonna put a stain on tankbuster's name!
i don't get your tricks off me!
kouji!
i'm coming!
you're brave!
i'm sick of the cat-f mouse game!
you just fell into my medical trap!
i'll take you with me if i fall, madox!
this is messed with madox!
there are some very important things i want to tell you, shiori.
paul wouldn't hurt anyone.
unimaginable."
i'm not your mother, brian.
you don't even like me.
are you really gonna stay?
not everything was clear.
i haven't even written my development clock yet.
there's a sound coming from the right brakes.
can they sew it back up?
what's your mother's name?
am i reacting to the drinks?
yeah, but searching his room, raping his privacy.
john, what would you say if i told you i asked the waitress at doc magoo's, that the night we lost the patient with marfan syndrome?
i'd say it's full of people with pager.
where did he get these?
will you buy the tickets?
someone might come and claim the body.
abby, can you look at something?
what patient?
how are you?
or find someone else you can eat lunch with at noon lunch with.
try to find his father.
please call my social worker and take me somewhere else?
would you please get me out of this room?
he stabbed carter.
why outside?

i don't want her taken anywhere else she doesn't know.

so you're gonna run off and tell your cowardly friends what i do?

yes!
i was getting something from marcel and i saw kirby in the street.
i saw it on the street behind the barber.

how do you know if it's marcel or not?
things have been happening since...
you want anything from the store?
what the hell!
tell me or i'll blow your head off!
why did he kill kirby?
kirby must have done something to that boy.
then why were you walking naked the other day in the middle of the road?
do you have a car?
let's go.
this is chris, okay?
he's older than you are.
he just wants to talk, okay?
about your situation.
get out of the car.
are you the bad boy who killed kirby?
a little girl too, isn't she?
it was an accident.
do you know who that girl is?
no.
she was my sister!
you're sending a boy to do what a man should do and he's fucking shit!
do it!
sorry about your brother.
you can put a bullet in kirby's head, and you can't kill this cunt?
brother jake...
how do you think you got here?
how do you think i know where you live?
marcel, you set me up?
marcel, talk to me, brother!
you set me up, brother?
you used me, brother!
i didn't tell you to kill that girl!
that's it.
my sister was only 00 and you killed her!
look at me!
look at me.
okay.
i just got out, but i lost my key.
maybe theft mothers were lazy.
_
no bruises...
it's still kind of hard, isn't it?
what are you talking about, brother?
my guy's here.
yes, isn't it karaoke?
i was gonna be there, right?
yeah, i'll be there.
listen, i got to go, okay, baby?
fuck!
what are you up to?
are you doing drugs in my bar?
one of them was in my place the other day, in the bathroom all the time... and he said he didn't do drugs!
what are you saying?
aaron and the other idiot, ed.
i don't know what they're doing.
not in my place, man!
okay, brother.
get out of my way.

it's okay, man.
get those bitch out of here!
come here, fucking...
come on!
go!
ed!
what the fuck?
brother, a woman left on the train.
and you brought her here, to me?
look, brother, it's more complicated than you think, okay?
where did you get that?
i found it somewhere.
00 cops with foam came out of nowhere.
that was the smartest job you ever did!
what are you gonna do with this baby?
you gonna give it to the cops?
am i gonna change my mind and go back?
i look like a pedophile.
no, if i do that, they'll send some home or something, right?
a woman leaves her own child on the train!
you see, she doesn't want him.
now i'm gonna change your pants!
let me take care of the gun for you, okay?
will you help me find her mother?
i have more important things to do than deal with this kind of bullshit.
you give me the gun, i'll hide it somewhere, okay?
give me the stuff.
why did you put it there, man?
come on!
no, call me when you're done with this stupid, okay?
because we have work to do, okay, asshole?
daddy!
let go!
move!
can ashley come?
sir?
i got it, man.
frankly, i'm a little nervous, honey.
why are you being nervous?
we're gonna figure this out.
well, i was talking to vince...
this is a kid my mother doesn't want.
what are you doing, brother?
what's the matter with you, man?
why are you acting like a bitch?
who are you, my brother, jeremy kyle?
you can't sell someone else's baby!
especially vince and carol.
the other day, we were selling wenches to this man!
no, you didn't, because she doesn't want to be found, man.
they're gonna give this kid to another vince and carol.
let go of me, brother.
i said i'd handle it, man.
what am i gonna tell people now?
yeah, yeah, good.
yes, but don't tell anyone we're here!
just take half, give me the rest.
i can't believe you sold a baby!
you didn't want it before, did you?
if i'm gonna go through all this stress, i'm gonna lose the money, and i'm gonna lose everything, so you need to talk to someone properly, okay?
nice lady.
i'm in "fucker," or something.
what's going on?
you sell drugs in the bar, right?
either you or your stupid brother took my gun and i need that gun.
you have 0 hours to get my gun back or i'll blow people's homes out.
i'm leaving.
she always messes things up, doesn't she?
why are you bringing this bitch to my place when my wife's upstairs?
what's going on?
she had problems with a solid russian mob wherever she was in trouble.
she thought they were gonna kill the baby.
so she left the baby on the train.
now, take this money, and i'll give it to ed the rest when i meet ed.
it's not fake, vince, you know it!
you can't understand when you're out of your mouth, can you?
it's not a problem when i have your fuck in my mouth!
she said your wound was in her mouth.
i'm not giving them the baby!
they can't take either!
easy, okay?
now get up and get that baby!
over here!
gun!
just know that you're dead to give it to you.
they may not let you go because you have no family.
do you have any idea what flowers she liked?
white roses are good, right?
fuck off then!
fuck you!
are you the owner of this car?
but you stopped me for nothing.
but before that, let's raise our glasses to the new owner, chester.
chester.
i hope he trembles on these wonderful monsters, as i've done for years.
cheers.
i promise you, i will rise to the standards of this show and you will be proud of it.
have a good trip where dreams come true.
thank god.
if that extravagant german is gone, the dominance will cross us.
marjorie, you're sober...
thanks, chester.
now, if you'll excuse me, the main family, monsters and weirdo community... spend your last moments alone.
bye.
there's someone else to thank.
mr. richard spencer.
our lives have completely changed your course.
cheers.
mm!
but we're gonna have a nice feast tonight, and then we're gonna watch a movie from my own collection.
not the sign of the cross again.
no.
tonight we watch freaks.
you know this movie, richard?
i can't say i know.
it's a great movie.
tell me about it, eve, paul.
ah.
cleopatra's a regular trapeze artist, and he marries a midget who makes small shows.
but the point is to poison him and make his fortune.
he plays all the freaks on his finger until one day he gets drunk and takes his true intentions out of his mouth.
then all the freaks become enemies.
one night they'll take their revenge with knives and guns.
home, home.
darling... don't tell me what's going on and lose your taste.
that sounds great!
there's a lot to do before heading west.
i can't.
shut up and sit down.
you deserve it.
what happened to you?
come on, richard, pick up.
i've been thinking about you a long time.
oh, thank god.
we had clients who stunned our show earlier, but... nobody's fainted.
are you all right, ma'am?
where are those security guards?
good to know.
now it's your turn.
jesus christ.
i don't even know that.
i've told them everything...
stanley.
elsa...
come on...
talk to them.
hollywood!
i'm afraid... like you said.
just a dream.
come on, turn it around.
aah!
god...
no.
please.
my cousin works at the garden of allah.
but you brought death here... and you have to pay for it.
put that down.
come on, come on.
elsa, come on... we need to talk in private.
i believe we find a joint point.
you think you can run now?
right.
he killed her.
he's not who you think he is.
and start running.
run!
run!
run!
just because your father grew up doesn't mean you're romanticizing the job because he's dead right now.
how did he die?
who killed him?
we all did.
he broke the rule.
now.
come on.
that was my father!
he killed a freak!
and the most delicate in us.
you believe his word?
this fraud bitch?
i saw dear ma petite with my own eyes in a jar.
i heard you talking to my own ears.
as for maggie, if she hadn't helped, we'd have more bodies.
i won't forgive him.
all i want is rot in hell.
you're gonna be friends with whoever's in this situation.
maggie's gonna change her bandages.
no!
_
now that your mother's not here, it's up to me to protect you and watch you.
i've seen you become a man and a man from childhood-- and we need you.
no hands!
i can't even piss myself.
i got an old friend.
he'll come and help you.
he's a real artist.
but the wounds need to heal first.
maggie's gonna help you.
let him.
i'm so sorry.
i hate hurting you.
really?
i thought that was your only gift-- hurting people.
i love you, jimmy.
this part is real.
i always have.
i want to make a fresh start.
we can still go to new york as planned.
why not?
you're kidding, right?
you think after everything you've done, we're just gonna sail to the new horizones?
my hands... in a fucking jar, and it's all your responsibility.
i'm so sorry.
can you turn ma petite from death?
huh?
i've changed, jimmy.
ah!
i knew you were stupid, let's put a blind on your list, okay?
find someone to focus on me!
i can't leave this place.
i have to set the right light for the first time, understand?
try again!
heisse!
elsa.
of course.
he's watching us.
can't we?
just this once?
please?
okay.
yeah.
mm.
oh.
thanks, chester.
you put me down.
like an old sock.
i'm sorry, marjorie.
i've got myself a little... but i'm happy now.
they've got magic, you're in.
maybe i should go.
we can handle it, marjorie.
the twins accepted you.
they just don't want you watching them do things.
they're using you, chester.
you're their boss now.
no, they don't.
they love me.
you're a murderer.
no, no.
no.
marjorie.
i know you don't like to talk about it, so don't mention it, but... you killed them.
alice and lucy.
impossible.
i'm just a puppet.
hmm.
love destroys you, chester.
you're losing control.
i know...
i'm a monster.
you don't need them.
i'm in.
i know.
please don't leave me, marjorie.
twins?
they have to go.
i know.
they will.
ethel looks great here with the choir girls.
oh, this is from her barnum days.
she was a unique woman.
ethel.
ethel.
so what do you say?
nobody heard what spencer said last night?
now everything is in place.
elsa killed ethel.
forest.
car accident.
it was all a stall.
i believe that.
that crazy, grudgy woman threw a knife at my paul.
elsa's only problem.
i didn't get it in my head anyway.
i know ethel.
he wasn't someone to kill himself.
not a coward.
she wouldn't do that to her own child, and of course she would.
and leave a decent note.
if someone comes after one of us, we know exactly what to do.
there's only one trust in our future.
that's elsa's life.
have you ever dreamed you'd feel that way, dot?
thank god you told me about marjorie.
all he had to do was push him.
i think we've certainly left it well behind.
good evening, girls.
what are you doing here?
i'm here to extend a friendly xindi.
i have some information on your last mission.
we don't want to hear anything from you.
leave nicely.
oh, dot, i can't blame you.
i acted terrible the other day.
but the recent events have caused my hard burns to soften.
i lost my mother.
so sudden and... terrible.
she was very upset, dandy.
losing a mother is a terrible situation for everyone.
it was.
yeah.
and it made me feel like i shouldn't let go of what i loved.
but i think you should know that i met a man.
actually, i got your news.
you have no idea how embarrassing it would be to marry you.
if i had the chance to get everything...
i came with friendly feelings.
i know i lost my chance.
i'm not half the man you deserve.
but i asked myself.
"daddy, what do you have to do to support the girls you love so much?"
then i thought i could protect you, and i hired a decent man so you can gather information about your new friend.
the result broke my heart because your chester creb was a maniac!
we don't need to look at these.
what's your problem?
you're a pain in the ass, and we don't trust you as much as we do.
ta-ta, then.
i did my best.
my mother always said that when a woman was angry, don't argue with her.
who is it?
son.
here.
drink.
what is that?
penicillin.
i'd hate to see you die of an infection.
who are you?
my name is massimo dolcefino.
i'm here to do your new hands.
okay?
massimo is an old friend of mine from before the war.
he's a master of art.
no, no.
i saw soldiers with their grenades exploded.
they put these cool hooks on their hands.
i can't pull 00 or anything, but at least i can hold my cigarettes on my own.
and i don't have to be afraid of wood dryers until the end of my life.
massimo offers you something bigger than rusty hooks.
more convincing.
look.
see?
so is the other one.
massimo saved my life.
your mother would've died of a drink, and she'd have left you open on the streets.
i could have married her if you weren't so stupid.
"all sin..."
si.
"... loving you..."
very much, very very much very very much
no!
they were members of an organization.
and the leaders are a doctor you know.
now get to the other one, don't rush this time.
for two years,
massimo took care of me.
she taught me to walk.
and dancing.
then hideburg fell.
nurmberg, rhineland...
we still had the chance to escape.
we had a plan.
how could i look into my love's eyes when i knew those monsters were free?
they were supposed to pay.
i hunted them all one by one.
aah!
finally, i reached the leader.
oh, the monsters.
dr. hans grouper.
there should be no painless death.
obviously my death wouldn't be painless either.
he took me personally to kill him.
very personal.
she tortured me.
she locked me in a cell and tortured me again, and again.
how did you get out?
i lived in austria until the end of the war.
then i came to america-- 00.
and i called miss mars for years.
but i couldn't answer.
if you loved her so much, and you knew where she was, why didn't you come on your feet?
my body was out of torture but...
i was like pinocchio.
there was nothing left of humanity inside me.
but, uh...
beautiful irony.
beautiful irony.
i know you guys have been together a lot, and it might be hard to make changes for a sit-down show.
and i repeat- this has nothing to do with ego.
for this persistence...
it looks so normal.
i don't think we can judge him after we have absolutely no proof.
what about the file?
it says he killed his wife.
you're letting dandy's lies embarrass your judgment.
dot and i have something to say.
we don't want to be your assistant anymore.
why?
we just... don't want to.
maybe you'll change your mind when you hear my final.
two bodies, two heads.
it'll sound a lot.
a first in the history of magic.
come on girls... let's rehearse.
we're not going in that box.
no, chester... we're not going in that box.
now excuse me...
i'll go.
you...
i could be your assistant.
yeah.
get in the box, lucy.
my name is maggie.
oop!
is this your magic show?
it seems a bitter.
shut up.
i didn't say anything.
what are you looking at?
backstage.
it's basically a magic saw.
tonight, you will watch a very dangerous version of me.
handcuffs.
hey, i...
i don't know this part.
i went to war for you.
you should've died there.
we loved each other.
and you came back with a metal plate in your head and a sparkling bees in your head.
chester, wait, i can't move my feet!
stop!
stop talking!
you distract me.
stop, marjorie.
haven't you ruined my life enough?
you're nothing without me.
i'll show you.
all of you.
chester!
chester!
chester, stop!
what are you doing?
relax, guys... it's just a magic show.
magic show.
i can bring her back to a search.
again...
alakazam!
drake...
abracadabra.
this is gonna be a lot of people, chester.
she made me do this.
she deserved it.
what do we do now?
steal your jewels and bury the bitch.
why are you packing?
you ruined everything again.
time to go.
you confuse me.
you did it unconscious to sabotage me.
i finally found happiness.
i'm leaving.
you can't leave without me.
oh.
i loved you.
chester... chester... chester... chester... chester
oh, god...
marjorie?
stay with me.
marjorie.
elsa's sympathy dayton, ohio, the first time you're gonna take tonight, my dear son-in-law, my dear son-in-law, and my dear son-law, who's gonna get your favorite boyfriend-you's gonna take the first time tonight's gonna take
jimmy darling!
i'm not a stage singer like you, mom.
listen to your mother.
you got a really good smile and a great towel.
you're star quality, jimmy.
now get your ass up on the stage and show your mother why you're proud of her.
jimmy.
maggie's dead.
want the details?
elsa's next.
tonight.
looks like... you're gonna have a real chance now.
jimmy...
good for you.
how dare you come in unannounced!
what do you want?
you have to go.
they've been planning revenge on ethel's trailer all day.
they'll kill you.
why should i believe you, huh?
my monsters love me.
i'm like a mother.
ethel was more like his mother than you.
you killed their real mother.
the last nonsense of a desperate man.
now who's desperate?
you saw what they did to him.
but where would i go?
anywhere but here.
you could have saved me.
now we did.
there you are.
what's jimmy doing?
he'd be here if he could.
it's time.
give me that.
ethel!
let's get some... justice.
oh.
thanks for coming.
i would never deny a woman in a difficult situation.
i'm not in trouble.
but i'm in a hurry.
oh.
i want to report a murder.
who was murdered?
a young woman.
put it there.
slowly.
put your hands where we can see them.
i did.
send me over.
what are you doing here?
i'm here to make a count.
i'm the new owner.
where's elsa?
gone.
he followed his dreams.
elsa sold us again.
$00,000 in cash.
nothing.
everything here, including your contracts, it belongs to me now.
and i want to see what belongs to me.
was that your dream, sir?
being in the show world?
dream.
yeah.
and now it becomes real.
i'm thirsty.
go get me a pipe lemonade.
yes, sir.
are you ready?
yeah.
they're perfect.
i want to try it now.
sure.
the other one.
you take it.
thank you.
but jesse james escaped and hid for two years.
the united states army had been after sitting bull's army and crazy horse's armies in the south dakota at the black hills.
after the defeat at the battle of little bighorn, the united states government has chosen the way of starving the lakota people to starve and submit.
hold the line!
but despite the small wars they fought against the united states army, the war of the indians was getting worse.
lakota leaders sitting bull and crazy horse's options were running low.
you're a man with a strong heart.
but i'm tired.
see you.
the native americans didn't give up, despite the violence they saw and the destruction of their tribes and their culture.
to go there for the living days, to get a chance to get rich.
many women and men have tried their luck.
once the golden economy resolved, the united states was the first country to rescue itself from global buhran.
the solution was found in the west.
there's been plenty of cattle in texas for a long time.
but it wasn't possible for them to be taken to starving people in the east until their railroads were completed.
in texas, the cattle were sold for $00 on the east coast for $00.
the cattle barons bought a large part of the field in california from kansas.
these lands provide incredible opportunities.
we're talking millions of hectar land, farms and thousands of major animals on them.
one of the cattle thieves in the new mexico area would turn into one of their reputable men of the west's evil.
his story started 0,000 miles east.
billy never recognized his father.
she and her mother moved to new mexico in the early 0000s.
for years, he's been wandering for no purpose.
what do you want?
whiskey.
drop the bottle.
there were different kinds of cowboys.
always in the corner.
that's all you had to be careful about.
billy used what he did best to make a living.
billy the kid was a good weapon.
he spent every dollar he'd made for practice.
in a place like this, only the strong ones would survive.
where are you going?
lincoln.
i'm just passing through here.
these cattle belong to john tunstall.
then john tunstall can come and get his cattle back.
it'll help if you let me go.
i don't think so.
i don't think you have a choice.
the young cattle thief, billy the kid, was captured by a farmer who tried to steal the cattle cattle.
most people shoot cattle thieves where they see them.
you still haven't told me who you work for.
i'm not working for anyone.
everyone works for somebody in lincoln county, son.
yeah, but i don't work.
you looked like a man used to buying me what you wanted.
you're right.
there's only one problem that i am.
you got a lot of men.
you got room for one more?
billy the kid needed a job when he came to lincoln.
john tunstall needed cowboys.
_
she moved to lincoln county where she could make money.
but he made some powerful men angry with his success.
lincoln was one of the wildest places in the wild west.
everything was in ev's control of the cattle prices, lands, government officials.
they even paid for their law enforcement.
actually, a lot of people in lincoln saw them as bully.
john tunstall had come to town for a long time, sticking his nose in the cattle business in ev's kick.
no one could stay impartial.
billy became the man of tunstall when john henry tunstall got involved.
in a few months, the young outlaw was tunstall's most trusted gunman.
for the first time in your life, my young orphan felt like it was in the west.
tunstall was a mentor to billy the kid.
pass me your plate, billy.
thanks.
i'm starving.
everything's going great, kid.
i'm glad you're with me.
thanks.
billy was always hard.
he was seen by many people as a foot team.
billy's age was incredible and life-changing thing.
while billy the kid was a part of the cattle industry, which used to grow as we were growing up, a few hundred miles north, a man was trying to stop the expansion of the west.
easy, guys.
i'm extending my left hand as a friendship proposal.
if he hadn't, most of us wouldn't be here today.
we would have died fighting against the settlement.
when they put us in the settlement, they actually took the soul of people.
she trusts me.
she's talking to me.
god, messiah.
this policy is known as "implation."
but i think they wanted to make us unprotected.
there was a promise used in the army.
"kill the indian and protect the human."
if you destroy the indians' cultures, you'd be better.
they thought we were savages.
the proud lakota warrior knew he had to go back to his people.
"my uncle's not happy here."
"i'm not happy here."
"we don't want to live in the field of space."
you're not used to life in the settlement.
give it time.
i'm sure you'll like it.
after offering their objections to the united states authorities, the military started afraid that the lakota warrior was starting a new indian leg.
the united states was afraid of the crazy horse.
the crazy horse wanted to kill a general who visited himself.
the united states authorities were worried about the rumors of a new footstep.
as the fright of crazy horse's planning something, the lakota warrior went to meet with the authorities to clear his name.
crazy horse thought he was seeing the united states authorities.
he never noticed the importance of the situation.
they wanted to put him in jail cell.
then he pulled out his knife.
despite different visions, i think the most trusted comment is that the white united states guard killed him by bayoneting him.
the crazy horse wasn't killed in the battlefield.
his vision was true.
unexpectedly defeated by the guard.
in september 0, 0000, the crazy horse was killed by the man who fought to protect his people and fought against the united states fighting against the united states.
it's hard to talk about the death of the crazy horse because even so many years later, the pain is fresh.
it's one of the most fascinating sides of the crazy horse and his inheritance that the united states leaders in the history of the united states are one of the few leaders who aren't most concerned about.
today, the courageous resistance to the united states government is seen as a symbol of resistance and speaks of respect.
i think that's why he's so strong.
with the death of the crazy horse, the lakota people waited for a leader who could save the rest of their desperate cultures.
until you paid for catron, their welfare was taking care of him.
this is for you.
what if he resistance?
i don't care how.
it's just the consequence of me.
understood.
go check it out.
you stay here.
okay.
what's your hurry, guys?
we heard a gunshot.
really?
don't do anything stupid, son.
this has nothing to do with you.
that's the way it works.
there are always entrances between these competition businesses.
but like many ideas in the west, it became personal.
when someone was killed, it was personal.
that was john henry tunstall.
she was killed because of a business conflict.
it was a personal matter now.
by the death of john tunstall, billy fell to find his killers.
