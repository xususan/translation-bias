she's fine, but she's in serious state.

i think you should remember what you enjoyed and start her again.
she'll come in a day or two.
she's like a real wife.
she looks good, right?
every minute she's left open... but the land she's found on is worth at least 00 million.
that's how accounting records get her.
we can change that.
now, our cash flowing plans in our department, our plans seem discarded, but she's not.
i didn't know she had information about something like that.
we're just gonna get the company, and then we're gonna put her out of action.
is this your job?
you buy companies, and then close her?
the factory is built on a precious property near the sea near the sea, near the
so we're buying the factory, shutting it down, and then we're taking over the shell company, and then we're selling the land.
that's the rules, she's rules

she's got a lot of similar direction.
this, uh, she's fine.
i did the right thing.
she thinks i can make my own decision.

she's always screaming.
you can come pick her up at 00 : 00 : 00 : 00 : 00 : 00 : 00 : 00
you can't help her in this situation.
i think i can do her.
she was just a slip slip.
this gooden guy is great, isn't she?
style reminds me of bob gibson on her game.
"let's lie on her. "
it's hard to admit that her parents' age, i know.
i think she can do better than dr. santana.
i want her to take a look at your father.
annie, this guy got up every day in her life and went to a job she never loved.
we never asked her.
but in return, it was your loving and interesting and interesting that got your father back from where she was gone.
she'll probably laugh and call me crazy, but she'll laugh.
that's a good idea.
and she'll be so much fun.
over the years, she's not getting enough pleasure from her daily life, and she's isolating the dream by turning things into a dream that she's enjoying.

you know, when your father was warned, whatever the police, the priest, praying, nothing will stop her.
she just wants to have fun !
the truth is,... she's been living under your raid for 00 years !
she wants her life back.
look at me or... see the old man anybody's seen.
she's not so good.
i love her.
she's a real family.
because i love her power.
and something had to be given, and she was my family.
she didn't seem that.
i mean, because we wanted to be normal.
i don't want to miss her.
tell me.
she threw the ball in the belly of the left wing, made the most famous run she ever wrote in history.
everyone there knew she knew that.
she ran after the ball.
but she couldn't make it clear that joe dimaggio shot her.
this man, who never made any sense, she was a human being.
well, and we've decided this is the right place to do it.
the last cadaver you brought was rotting when i opened her with a knife blade on her.
the guy's sword was so loose and now she's looking at herself with this beautiful sword looking at her sword.

push him against the guy, and she'll increase her speed.
why are they showing this to me now?
actually, she worked.
she can tell us what billy did to her partner before he attacked her.
part of the blood in the car is her part.
angel feels responsible for this kid because he brought her back from hell.
i feel responsible because she did it to save me.
some people lose their mind quickly.
i cut, i'm torn, shat, my face, my face, and i've been hurt every second, and i'm not gonna know if it's going to end or worse until she dies.
and she's strong enough, "treacherous bitch never put on her clothes. "
i'm 00 years taxi, i understand why she did this.
so billy's power to freak people out, she seems in his blood.
which means it could mean it could be her sweeter or spit, and even touch her touch.
maybe your mom and dad never told you what men, grown men, what she went after.
leave her at the table when she wants money and get away.
she's just an apple. "
poor, helpless, crushed woman, she needs to strike out all the unfair rights she's done to her.

this is your job, right?
she's allergic, and she's got a special fast fast fast fast to make.
i hit her with a hairbrush till it broke.
you see, both of our will is she's very powerful.
then whose then?
i look forward to her coming home to show my mother.
yeah, i'm sure she'll be happy.
i'm sure she'll be back soon.
i agree, but not her.
don't think her that.
i've accepted her.
this man is here to tell her how wonderful she is.
