michael had been sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, the man he shared his bed was his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's okay for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i will.
i have to write at least 000 words about the morality of a war and the morbidity of a warp and progression.
i'm not sure you'd appreciate me cheating while we're writing our morally teacher's trial.
so, you passed through my morals test.
actually, it was hopelessly burned, hopelessly, hopelessly, hopeless, hopelessly, to the teacher of bethaueradly.
criminals can be cut off even the hands of a man who committed crimes.
no ring no no ring no ring no ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you were son?
*.d.k.'s eye was on us.
your dad thought it would make us look better.
she must have imitated my signature.
'one year ago, i'd be the son of a bitch who finished her scumbag cheese.
you've got to get me out of this.
i call social services, but you need to get buster back.
but i can't look at her.
i don't have a mother's compassion and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disruption.
i'm giving you an olive dive.
yes.
by the way, when did you sleep with anyone?
by the way, lindsay was on her homework to george michael.
i can tell you why.
i guess because there are things that people can't tell their father.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set up his teacher... to get him his mother's job instead of his mother.
there's nothing wrong with that.
however, i must say i'm a little disappointed that you didn't think about me for that.
that's what the halos can do.
the teachers can replace this mission.
sure, one day, you'll find the right woman to replace this mission.
but until i make it, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay had never been so proud of what she said in her whole life.
by the way, gob was waiting for michael to arrive.
shannon, the girl i keep telling you.
she's really... young girl.
date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
"agarma," you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache.
yeah.
but gob michael's courtesy has been misunderstanding the emotional interest he's made for michael's courtesy, and he's feelin' the competition to get involved.
because, you know, beyond love... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
ughsia, michael, shannon, really?
and a surprise visit to george srr. was about to arrive.
i've read all your teachings and got all your tapes.
and i watched it all over again.
george sr. has been offered to sell a series of tapes of people he's offered to make money from the spirituality he'd just discovered.
in the meantime, i've lost two pounds, eating your banana bl ruth jail bar.
i came to find out.
this is a good place to start.
and michael met with lindsay at her parents' school night after they got rid of two girls she was dating two girls.
hey, linds, is this my dream product... or is this one with this blissing room with our kitchen gun?
i think she's perfect for you.
i used to think that would make your mother realize.
besides, i can't marry someone just because my son wants me to have a son, so i can't marry someone.
i'm mrs. baerly, morals.
my goal is to make sure my students understand the value of life that can be destroyed by an insignant pull of a trigger to a person's insignia.
and michael began to know his son's morally teacher.
that's the "rrrrr" side of the situation.
you know, it's so annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a paralyzed paralyzed.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you laughed.
"rrrrr!" - "rrrrrrrrr!"
but, you know, ...
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
one question for you.
a parents teacher can invite you for a drink?
or...
yeah, he's dead.
i think it's because mr. daniels had a paraly...
let's go have a drink.
well, maybe it'll help.
georger was dealing with his own fan.
i already told you my sins.
maybe you could tell me a couple of sins.
well, there's a hukichi show showing my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me one of those things about... one of them in college bed again.
and michael's meeting with her second date with mrs. mr. mr.erly today...
michael, this little korea is here, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it is.
you're gonna have to peel it down to your pants to say something.
yes, mom.
they'll get it back.
don't take your shoes off, little gentleman!
keep your shoes off!
it's out of control.
who is it?
it's "annong, " your dad" and i got married.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille buster realized that she was worried, even jealousy.
and he realized what it felt like to ignore it.
yongyongyongyongyongy your sister's
cancel it.
it stays.
listen, i'll call you back.
that was nice.
are you booking dinner?
he made a "fat korea."
and after meeting....
michael took a step that he hasn't been throwing for years.
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we leak everyone in without waking everyone up?
this may not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i love.
i took someone you love.
"nashbaggerlajamamam '..."
listen, i know you're trying to avenge me for the marta thing.
i was lying to you when i told you i wasn't gonna try to get her to bed, so...
he has to accept that.
i don't think there'll be any problem with that.
right.
i just slept with someone.
i say again, i didn't like nazhalia.
i really had a chance that i got rid of him.
no problem.
very romantic.
who's "n. h-ah-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i must say i didn't know it was real.
but now, now... your moral teacher...
yeah, i did it for her.
oh.
he likes sadamossein.
but, you know, in business, i'm sure you're interested in him.
i'm sure you don't like sadam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
about his class?
i mean, when she loved her loyalty...
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew you had a moral responsibility to tell your son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob has slept with him.
well, why did he do that?
why did he sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know this, but gob new...
it's not one of the good shooters who's targeting your target, and it's almost everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think... that she was... anything?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
in the different dance, young girls escorting the young girls... and i thought i'd go up to him and do something...
"amel, you want to dance?"
and she's just, like, i thought she'd be, like, "what's it gonna be?" okay?
i've done the same, but...
but, you know, it's, uh, messing up with joke, or we're doing something else.
i didn't think so.
don't you think you should go out with someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i had a book that was difficult to find a picture of the bathroom in a bathroom bathroom suite.
"what would my brother do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, here's the same exit from our fire escape.
in prison, george sr. was preparing for my evening with the most loyal fan he'd spend with.
it's about the time gandhi lightballoon made their own preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and while george michael was still angry with gob... he went to find a family specialist looking for you to create a problem with it.
i know you're dating shannon.
that ponpon girl?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid, different dancers.
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr daniels and i asked him... but he was breathing and he dropped his phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe i should go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hi.
my mother took it.
he's telling me he's recording her.
my new little sister.
so we're relatives.
and michael went to discuss george michael's situation with mrs. bearly.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morals...
you see, george michael made you this post.
you know, she's like, she's in love with you, so...
he knows we're out.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this may be the most foolish thing i've ever heard in my whole life.
well, you've only been a half-time moron teacher.
look, this is a prejudice move.
my sister was gonna try to sleep with you.
so, i want to break up with you right now, and i'm not going back to you.
i see.
from now on.
georger. went on a walk with s.r. gandhi.
george.
and he began to recognize her.
you can pour me completely at home here.
it weightes my soul.
you...
he's fighting the camera.
i'm taking your dinner, this is your dinner, so it's with my mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy.
watch your back with your back, my little brother!
and the different spring dance was in the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you don't take her perfectly perfectly perfectly-looking nose because she doesn't have a strong square jaw that doesn't have eyes.
want to dance?
all right!
finally gob finally found shannon...
gobun found out he was cheating on her with the nazhibbia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hi, lisa.
shannon!
sorry.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!!!!!!!!
i messed up our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about this for a long time, and-and...
that's... that's your right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school dance fun?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, with my moral teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my moral teacher.
after being so bad to you, it really made me feel like you're trying to protect me.
in fact, he mistook the morality teacher that gob michael's teacher was dating with the teacher at the homeland information.
man, he... he knew.
gob was a teacher for mrs whitehead country info.
second move.
i was seeing mrs. baerly, and i should never have involved gob.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with the kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed on some sad things, but...
i don't think we'll have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm taking that cake.
hey, you want to dance?
i can't believe this worked.
next one's in development.
buster's pulling is off.
stop, stop, stop, stop!
it's forbidden to have candles here.
mom's going crazy.
no, it's okay.
i burn my own candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
no problem.
right here, let me help you.
these?
okay, let me carry it for you.
yeah.

what you suggest, connie, it's really something.
too much.
come!

ok!
ok!
come!
come!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we're all going one day, aren't we?
four months ago, each of you joined an interview, to join a tv show that has never been done before.
and guess what?
you won.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
you're my biggest color yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm a total gay man and i'm proud of it.
you're sweet, aren't you?
i want to rule our country.
next question.

she doesn't know.
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 00 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they look like barack obama these days.
each one of you're gonna make $00,000.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
damn!
great.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know if this is a donkey joke?
right.
this is our third show, but we're not gonna run it through the fall.
you're gonna have to play the game and win the money to see if it's a donkey joke or not.
you will be asked to replace a series of duty.
the mission will force your limits, your courage and your thought.
sounds fun, doesn't it?
what kind of duty are these, man?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i didn't even have a girlfriend to admit it when she was a dickhead.
i have to take care of my little sister.
i'm in.
you're crazy.
do you know the past of this prison?
some people died there.
like what?
go around.
you'll notice.
the money will be equal to the survival of the survivors, but if you all take the night off, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can spend the night here.
anyone else want to join him?
not me.
i can't possibly go to the city with this little kid with this little sidikic kid like
i do.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you idiot.
it's a fucking party joke, they're all gonna be fucking with you.
you don't look anything but a bunch of idiots.
can't you see it's a party that was taken in this rock.
or we'll be famous.
there's a human head!
don't worry, it's not real.
it looked pretty real to me.
that's why they call ourselves special effects.
isn't that nice?
a small sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thank you for our bounty special effects team.
follow me, friends.
in the hot swamp water, lazy crocodiles are waiting for their prey.
the crocodiles are long and selfish.
this kind of crocod...
guys.
i see you work hard as always.
are we ready?
we're all set.
and absolutely.
keep it up.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great to scare them.
yeah.
i can't believe these guys are gonna show up.
you looked really scared.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place looks really creepy.
did you know that?
homeless?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
a big coincidence.
do you really think it's safe there?
the show's safe enough for insurance.
any other questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're moving.
each of you have been chosen by your own free will, to make $00,000 a night in jail.
isn't that clear enough?
okay, let's party.
you can find everything you need in your main camp, that's the manager's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe one of you better write.
but how can we write all the others?
go down the hallway, turn right, back to the right, then left.
straight up to the stairs, left, right, and one more left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
you'll find a key to get rid of your chains there.
is there someone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought getting out of the basement was horrible.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to duty.
can you not do that?
i can't see aunt in here.
anybody remember where we're going?
go, right, then left.
no straight, two times right, then left.
there was too much going.
go straight down the hallway,
"do it back, make it right, and left.
"go straight to the stairs,
"sola, right, and left again."
what are you?
smart.
it's gonna be a great show.
careful.
careful.
god.
what is this place?
and be ready.
that was fun.
let's speed them up a little.
okay, my queen.
come!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
the generator had to enter the patrol.
damn!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's freezing in here.
look, the key.
yeah.
okay.
look, people.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think he's the manager.
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what, man?
"the brave competition.
"welcome to clem harvis's office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room.
"your personal role in your personal role will be set.
"you can't change yourstone with other contestants.
"jil it was his favorite".
now it's your turn to put your hand in the box.
shit.
well, who wants first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean i don't know?
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black.
black castle.
white horse.
white.
look.
damn!
that was really awkward.
my little pigs, welcome to duty.
now let me tell you about pennyville state prison.
in the time of the attack in 0000, when the cost of cost, the brutal manager thought he'd raise his fortune by destroying some of the harassing.
these were prisoners!
the principal's crimes weren't executed for 00 prisoners until they were blamed.
the last person who was punished here for the last time was director harvis himself.
rumor says the director's still roaming the halls here.
you will be asked to face the spirits that have seen you tonight with the director and this building under torture.
first duty.
your white queen.
try not to die!
anyone want to change?
absolutely no!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the church of the prison to complete the mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first corridor.
sounds great.
thank you.
damn!
what happened?
they shut down my flashlight.
i can't see anything.
okay, relax, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung the babies!
their children...
i think they've got it all covered with vods.
the sounds are more powerful than the image to trigger our fears.
is that right?
okay.
god!
sounds great.
no, i'm fine, man.
nut.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
there's a sound.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're calling from the vodor, randall.
really.
okay.
oh...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flashlight.
okay now?
open the page from the bible...
"you will find god's blessing there.
00 years ago, this place was disrespectful,
"but this place is the room of unusual events."
uh... "safi".
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do that.
"when you complete your look...
"if there's no sign of the manager,
"you can go back to camp."
a deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry if i disturb you now.
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
" protect us from evil...
"our father in the cra...
"don't let evil rule us.
" protect us from...
"for forgive us our debt, as we forgive those in debt.
"give us the day our bread.
" as in heaven...
" just as it's in the take,
'cause rule and rule is yours.
please tell me i can go now.
" before we go to the camping road"...
god, randall, you have to put out my candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there a minute.
look what they've done for money.
where he went.
from what i understand, the people who do this work for this job are just a shortcut to our homo friends to give us some creepy weather.
whatever.
absolutely, it went away.
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
dude, it's not that bad.
absolutely not worth the money.
but the mission was worth money.
thank god i finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it again.
they can assignment you again.
don't joke.
i swear, you don't even know how people feel there.
it's like you walk in a busy fog, just cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me or is it getting cold in here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to get to the next one.
what do you mean?
"but the cameras don't work"?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these device is very complicated.
let's send scelati down and shake it, you know.
scotland.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
either we talk or i'll go or i'll go or i
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i had a little research done.
are you talking about the town girls you're sleeping with?
am i right?
big lips, big hips, taylor.
okay, prison wasn't just for men?
do women have a chapter?
and that fucking freak director doesn't answer anybody around the woman's department.
they beat them, raped them, they get pregnant, and they starve.
some say they feed their own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this true story is going to raise the show!
anyone might be talking to us.
that's nothing compared to the story you made up.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do this, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
yeah?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they do.
good.
scotland, what's that?
it's just a little thing to make me night out.
want some?
get your hairy ass here, okay?
captain.
hello?
you scared me.
i've got something great.
suit yourself.
we're all ready to begin.
i'd say my biggest fear is buried alive.
where am i going now?
"here will make you free."
ok
at the end of the freedom.
what am i doing now?
tell her to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
damn!
what? what?????
blood.
it's not real.
no swear, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs aren't down, so go upstairs.
i'm sorry.
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you land down, you'll see a fingerprint door.
she says...
damn!
welcome to cell five.
"if we think about violence and madness,
shit.
tell me what i have to do... and i'll get the hell out of here.
no!
thank you.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a prisoner can't kill himself,
"you're going to live a sentence to a prisoner."
okay, where's the pit?
under your feet.
this place is so full of shit.
remember the money.
that's a very difficult mission.
"what are you gonna do when you break in."
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my duty.
connie.
what? what?????
look at this.
what? what?????
no...
you're fired.
why?
you turn me behind my back, and especially after i've made my statement to you, did you add anything, and you still ask why you're fired?
this is not our man.
where'd he go?
who the hell is that?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you got to get that guy out, okay?
he's gonna put it in the show.
damn!
we're ruined.
you didn't bring this there?
no cut.
clear.
what's open?
come closer.
i asked you why you put a camera in the control room.
yeah.
the camera behind the video... what they want to record...
wow!
wow!
you're right.
genius, right?
absolutely genius.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to know how he scares us by putting something in a show?
bingo!!!!!o!
so what do we do now?
we're going to go on.
as planned.
three.
black and white horse.
mission four.
black and white queen.
i told you you could go back on duty.
it's pretty.
okay, black and white white horse turn right and go to the gas room.
the white queen and black horse keep going straight, and they go to prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"to the right after the hawk and the horse.
"let's go all the way to the end of the hallway,
"and down the stairs."
scotland, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scotti, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, open it.
we're in.
welcome to the laptop room.
there must be a light in the wall behind you, open it.
they enter the black black black and white horse gas room.
well done, connie.
it deserves the best, it's completely real.
it's the only place he's cleaning the law department.
isn't it beautiful?
pretty scary.
god.
what is that smell?
a disturbed real death death rooms often carry their own smell of death.
of course, the smell isn't your death.
if a man knows his life has come to his last moments, he's worried about the last radide, and he's got a lot of stinking stinking stinking stinking material.
in this case, the smell of human smell and the smell of gas that kills it.
now fun time, ladies and gentlemen.
he sits in the black chair.
black?
this is me.
stand by for further instructions.
"you'll find some meat and a attitude.
" cook this meat and eat."
man!
the prisoners always eat meat cow, pig...
"or that he wasn't his cousin, and another meat...
"they suspected you.
"they thought it was a pleasant meat they never had before."
you mean human meat, right?
are you inside?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i give up.
you're gonna tie toni.
i'm getting you out of here, toni has to be completely terrified of the prisoners before the gas was given.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriend's wishes are weird.
are you okay?
okay.
"your mission's gas teammate...
"to find the main van and stop the gasoline."
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to throw up.
okay.
weird.
i can't do that.
