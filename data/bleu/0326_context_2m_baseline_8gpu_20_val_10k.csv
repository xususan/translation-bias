michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, the person he shared his bed was his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss mom.
i will.
i need to write an essay on at least 000 words... about the morality of a war and a conflict.
i'm not sure our ethics teacher would appreciate me cheating while trying.
so, you passed my moral test.
actually, gorgeemichael had desperately burned his brother... desperately, to his teacher, bethbly.
small crimes... people with small crimes... can barely cut their hands.
no ring ring ring ring ring no ring ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
you need to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
g.d.k.'s eye was on us.
your father thought it would make us look even better.
he must have faked my signature.
'maybe a year ago i'll have a son who's finished his sweat cheese!
you gotta get me out of this.
i'll call the social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't look at him either.
i don't have a mother's kindness and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
they're a couple of fun girls... a couple of fun
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm offering you an olive branch here.
yes-yes.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
meanwhile, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
why do i tell you this?
i guess it's because there's some things you can't tell your father.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to arrange his teacher for his mother's duties to his father.
there's nothing wrong with that.
but i have to explain to you that i'm a little hurt because you don't think about it.
and aunts can do that.
and the teachers can do that job.
surely, one day, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay had never been so proud of what she said all her life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i was telling you about.
girl, really... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma," you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the moustache.
yeah.
but gob michael's courtesy misunderstood his emotional attraction... and felt he was competing to get involved.
because, you know, beyond love... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
_
and george sr. was about to get a surprise visit.
i've read all your teachings and got all your tapes.
and i watched it all again.
george sr. had recently released a series of cassettes... which he'd given to people... to make money for the spirituality of his new discovery.
i also lost two pounds at the same time eating your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to find out.
this is a good place to start.
and michael met lindsay at parent-teacher night after two girls who were dating.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this rape room have the same gun plan as our kitchen?
i think he's really good for you.
i'd think that'd make her think it was a mother thing.
besides, i can't hurry up and get married just because my son wants to.
i'm miss baerly, the ethics teacher.
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life... that could be destroyed by a reckless tether.
and michael started getting to know his son's ethics teacher.
that's the "rrr" part.
you know, it's annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels' stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you laughed.
"rrr!" - "rrr!"
but, you know, ... ... . ....
and i think i'm a moral man.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite you for a drink?
or... or... or... or... or
yeah, he's dead.
well, i think that mr. daniels' paralysis incident... is...
let's go get a drink.
well, maybe it'll help.
george sr. was working on his own fan.
i've already told you a lot of my sins.
maybe you can tell me a few sins.
well, there's a legal display of my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me about one of the things that happened... once again at the college dorm.
and what does michael have to do with his meeting with miss bayerly, who's got a second date today... and, uh,
michael, this little korean, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it's him.
to be precise, you have to rob her to the underwear.
yes, mother.
they'll take her back.
don't take off your shoes, little gentleman!
don't take off your shoes!
it's out of control.
who is it?
this "momong," your father and i were adopted.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille found out that buster was worried, even jealous.
and he figured out what it feels like to be ignored.
annyong's your brother's your sister's your sister
abort.
he's staying.
listen, i'll call you sonar again.
nice ride.
you're making dinner reservations?
he did a little korean.
and after the meeting... and after the dates...
michael took a step that he hasn't thrown in years.
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how are we gonna leak in without waking everybody up?
this may not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i love from you.
so i took someone you love.
i'm "nashbaggerlajam"...."
listen, i know you're trying to get back at me for the whole marta thing.
i was lying to you when i said i wasn't gonna try to sleep him, so...
he has to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i'm really lucky i got rid of him.
no problem.
so romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i gotta tell you i don't know if it's real.
but now, your... moral teacher... now... is... your teacher...
yeah, i did that for her.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm sure you're interested in him, you know.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
about his class?
i mean, that he loves her saddam... that he loves her...
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with him.
well, why would he do that?
why did morality sleep with my teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new... new...
he's not one of the good shooters who targeted him, and he's about to shoot everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was... his...
i mean, you don't think he's old enough for you, do you?
we don't even know how old he is.
nobody knows.
she was escorting young girls from different dances... and i thought i'd go over to her and do something...
hey, you wanna dance?"
and i thought, "what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it differently across the mirror, but...
but, you know, um, we've been dancing with jokes or doing something else.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should go out with someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've analyzed a hard book to find a picture of the saddam disappointment in the bathroom suite.
"what would tradam do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's just like our fire exit.
in prison, george sr was preparing to spend the evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon made his preparations.
how are we doing?
we got a video.
and george michael, while he's still angry at gob, he's called the family specialist to create problems.
i know you're dating shannon.
that cheerleader?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different dancers.
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and i asked him... but he was breathing and he dropped his phone.
i haven't heard back.
you know, maybe we should both go.
right, i mean, he was a bad influence...
hi.
mom took it.
do's making me record her at school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the situation between mrs. bearly and george michael.
sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're attracted to her.
i want to talk to you about it.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality... about morality...
you see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, he's like you, he's in love, so...
he knows we're dating.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most unethical thing i've ever heard in my life.
well, you've only been a moral teacher for half a year.
look, it was a preemptive move.
my brother was gonna try and sleep with you.
well, i want to leave you right now and i'm not going back to you.
i see.
starting now.
george sr. went for a walk with cindi.
george.
and she's getting to know him.
you can pour it all to me in here completely.
it weighs on my soul.
you...
he's grabbing the camera.
i'm taking you to the grandmother dance, this is your dinner, so it's away with mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong man.
watch your back, my little immigration brother!
and the different spring dances were at the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting him in because he doesn't have a strong square jaw in his flesh-shaped eyes, like you.
do you want to dance?
all right!
gob finally found shannon he was looking for...
gobun found out he was cheating on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
sorry.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i screwed up, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about this for a long time, and-and... and... and...
that's... that's what you mean by the right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, with my moral teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my moral teacher.
after you've been so mean to you, i'm really moved by you trying to protect me.
in fact, gob mistook michael's ethics teacher with the domestic information teacher.
man, he's... he's got it.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a domestic teacher.
act two.
i was seeing miss baerly, and i shouldn't have brought gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked him, i didn't know what else to do.
i never wanted to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed at some sad things, but...
i don't think we're gonna have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm taking this cake.
hey, you wanna dance?
i can't believe this is working.
he's on the next arrested development.
buster's piss is fried.
stop, stop, stop, stop!
no candles allowed here.
my mom's going crazy.
no, it's okay.
i'm lighting my own candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
no problem.
right here, let me help you.
these?
okay, here, let me carry it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is something really extreme.
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
ok!
ok!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we'll all go one day, won't we?
four months ago, each of you joined an interview to join a tv show that has never been done.
and guess what?
you win.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm totally gay, and i'm proud of it.
you're cute, aren't you?
i want to lead our country.
next question.
my name is angel, from england.
me too.
that's my brother stanton, my probation officer.
hi.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him in the head.
he doesn't know.
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they look like barack obama these days.
each one of you is gonna make $00,000.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
fuck!
great.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know if this is a prank?
right.
actually, this is our third show, but we're not gonna do it until the fall.
to see if it's a prank, you're gonna have to play and earn the money.
you'll be asked to perform a series of missions.
the missions will force your borders, your courage and your thinking.
that sounds fun, doesn't it?
what kind of assignment are these, man?
make up your mind now.
i'm in.
where am i signing?
i didn't even have a girlfriend to admit it when she was high.
i need to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some people died there.
like what?
go around.
you'll notice.
the total amount of money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if you all take the night off, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can make me spend the night here.
anyone else want to join him?
not me.
there's no way i'm going to town with this pissed-boy to the city
i'm in.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you're stupid.
it's a fucking party joke, you're all gonna get high.
you don't look anything but a bunch of idiots.
can't you see it's a party on this record?
or we'll be famous.
there's a human head in there!
don't worry, it's not real.
it seemed pretty real to me.
that's why they call it "special effects."
lovely, isn't it?
a little sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thank you for our rewarding special effects team.
follow me, fellas.
they're in hot swamp, waiting for lazy crocodiles.
the indian crocodiles are tall and slimy-faced.
to these crocodiles...
guys.
i see you work hard as usual.
ready?
we're all set.
and exactly.
keep it up.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great to scare them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are gonna join the show.
you really looked like you'd been compromised.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really gives me the creeps when i look at it.
did you know that?
the homeless who died?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
it must be a big coincidence.
do you really think it's safe there?
safe enough for the show to be insured.
any other questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're rolling.
each one of you has been selected by your own free will to spend the night in jail for $00,000 a head.
clear enough, isn't it?
all right, let's get the party started.
you can find everything you need at your base camp, that's the principal's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you took all of us, how can we write it down?
go down the aisle, turn right, right, right, then left.
straight to the stairs, left, right, and another left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
you'll find a key to get rid of your chains there.
is there anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought it was horrible to leave the basement.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to the mission.
can't you just not do that?
i can't see a damn thing in here.
does anyone remember where we're going?
straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, two right, then left.
it was too flat.
no, go straight down the hall, down the hall, down the hall, down the
"turn around, make it right again, and left.
"then straight as the stairs, upstairs,
"sola, right, and left again".
what are you?
smart.
illet will be a great show.
careful.
careful.
god.
what is this place?
and get ready.
that was fun.
let's give them some speed.
okay, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
the power's running out, the generator should have come in already.
shit!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's freezing.
look, key.
yeah.
okay.
look, people.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who's that?
i think it's the warden.
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what, man?
"hi, brave contestants.
"welcome to warden clem harvis.
"there's a box in the middle of the room.
"this chess piece will determine your personal role.
"you cannot change your balls with other contestants.
"the rags were his favorite".
"now it's your turn to put your hand in the box."
shit.
well, who wants to go first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black rook.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
fuck!
that was really crazy.
my little piggies, welcome to the mission.
now, let me tell you about pennyville state prison.
in the time of crisis in 0000, when the cost went up, the brutal warden thought he'd raise his fortune by destroying some desperate expenses.
they were prisoners!
by the time the warden's crimes were released, 00 prisoners were already executed.
the last person to be sentenced to death here was director harvis himself.
rumor has it that the manager was still out here in the halls.
you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured souls under this building tonight.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
anybody want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the prison church to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first hallway.
it's a great sound job.
thank you.
shit!
what happened?
they've turned off my flashlight.
i can't see anything.
okay, relax, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung babies!
children... children of their children... children...
i think it's all covered with speakerphone.
voices are more effective than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
god!
that sounds great.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
something came up.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're using speakerphone, randall.
really.
okay.
oh...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flashlight.
okay now?
open the marked page from the bible...
"there you will find god's prayers.
"in 00 years ago, the sacred place was disrespectful to this place,
"now, this is a room for extraordinary events."
oh, my... the opposite.
impossible.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do that.
"when you complete your mission...
"if there's no sign of the director,
you can go back to camp.
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry about who i'm bothering.
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
"prot us from evil... protect us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"don't let evil control us.
"protection us from overstepping...
"as we forgive those who owe us, forgive us our debts.
"give us our daily bread today.
"as in heaven...
"like the sky,
"because kingdom and rule are yours."
please tell me i can go now.
"before going camping."
jesus, randall, you have to put out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look what they do for money.
where'd he go?
i understand that the people who did this job have cut our contact with our homo friend for a while, trying to make it a more creepy weather.
whatever.
it's definitely gone in a groove.
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
have you seen anyone?
no.
come on, man, it's not that bad.
definitely not worth the money.
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it again.
they can assign you again.
don't joke.
i swear, you don't even know how you feel there.
it's like you're walking in a busy fog, just cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you expect me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complex.
let's get scelzi to go downstairs and check it out.
scelzi.
yeah.
you gotta go downstairs and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
either we talk or i'll go.
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i did a little research.
are you talking about the town girl you're sleeping with?
am i right?
big lips, broad hips, taylor.
okay, prison wasn't just for men, was it?
there's a women's department?
and the damn crazy warden wandered around the part of the women's department, he didn't answer to anyone.
he beat them, raped them, pregnant, and starved them to death.
it's said that some people feed their own babies.
what do you mean?
what do i mean?
this real story will increase the attention of the show!
anyone could be talking about us.
that's nothing compared to the fact that you're making this story up.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do that, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
yeah?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yeah, they do.
good.
scelzi, what's that?
it's just a little something that makes me take the night off.
you want some?
get your hairy ass over here, okay?
aye, aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the shit out of me.
i got a great stuff in my hand.
suit yourself.
we're all ready to start.
i'd say my biggest fear is to be buried alive.
where am i going now?
"here's gonna set you free."
okay, okay, okay
i'm at the end of liberty.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
fuck!
what?
blood.
it's not real blood.
no curse, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs aren't down, you're up.
sorry.
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down, you're gonna see a finger door.
he says... he's... he's
shit!
"welcome to prison number five, please.
" considering the violent and insanity and insanity,
shit.
tell me what to do... and i'll get the hell out of here.
no!
thank you.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a convict can't kill himself, if he doesn't, he can't,
"now you'll be punished for a prisoner."
okay, where's the hole?
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult task.
"what will you do when you get in the hole?"
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my mission.
connie.
what?
check this out.
what?
no... no... no... no... no
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back, and i specifically told you... that the show added something, and you still want to know why you were fired?
this isn't our guy.
where'd he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you gotta get that guy out, okay?
he's gonna screw up the show.
shit!
we'll be screwed.
you didn't bring this up there?
not with cuts.
it's obvious.
what's open?
come closer.
i asked you why you were putting a camera in the control room.
yeah.
behind the camera footage... what they wanted to record... the footage... the footage... the
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
genius, isn't it?
absolutely brilliant.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to record how you scared us by putting something on the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black king and white horse.
duty four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you could be on duty again.
smartass.
okay, black king and white horse turning right and heading to the gas chamber.
the white queen and the black horse are running straight, and they're going to the prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"man and horse go left and turn right.
"tro and the horse go to the end of the hall,
"and go down the stairs".
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, open it.
we're in.
"welcome to the packing room.
there must be a light in the wall behind you, turn it on.
"black king and white horse are entering the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
it deserves the best, it's the whole place.
it's the only place the legal department has cleaned up.
good, isn't it?
pretty creepy.
god.
what's that smell?
a documented fact of execution rooms often carry the smell of death itself.
of course it's not the smell of death.
if a man knows his life is coming to the end of his life, his concern is that he has plenty of stinking.
in that case, what we're worried about is the smell of human smell and the gas that killed him.
it's fun time, ladies and gentlemen.
the black hawk is sitting in the chair.
black king?
this is me.
wait for further instructions.
"there's some meat and you're gonna find a chicken.
you'll cook this meat and eat it.
man!
the inmates always eat meat, pork, pig...
"or because there's no lamb, and there's another meat...
"they suspected it was happening.
"they thought it was a nice meat they never tasted before."
you're talking about human flesh, aren't you?
are you in there?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i gave up.
you're gonna tie toni.
i'm giving it to you, toni should be fully intimidated by the fear of the prisoners just before the gas is given.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends have some weird demands.
are you okay?
okay.
"your mission's gas teammate...
"to find the main valve and cut the gas before it kills."
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to throw up.
okay.
strange.
i can't do that.
i can't.
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
no more "fat jokes."
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they'll pay extra money".
do it for the team, girl.
are you gonna throw up?
thank you.
okay, angel, i'm at the bottom of the stairs.
shit!
can you hear me?
he's back.
it really stinks.
let me out.
come on.
let me out, man.
god!
who's standing there?
smooth.
muscular.
let me out.
i don't know, con, this guy is freaking me out.
stop playing games.
let me out.
how's it going?
we need to talk to you.
outside?
yeah.
i have big news.
i think the company's playing us.
what?
who's there?
who are you?
show me the gas chamber.
and what are we gonna do with the concierge?
where are they?
i don't know, just give me a second.
there.
see that man again?
wow!
who's that?
okay, how did he get here so fast?
isn't that the guy in the picture?
yeah.
yeah, it looks like that.
nice.
no, not cool at all.
this man can walk through walls, or there's more than one man.
we all watched "pricej," didn't we?
mind if we pass?
please?
guys?
guys?
fake blood, fake case.
they did good.
maybe even oscar will.
no.
no, that's not true.
it's completely out of scenario.
sounds real to me.
connie, they're playing us.
trust me.
what?
look.
they copied his picture.
what?
acting.
clothes.
easy.
stop.
no.
no.
he's a real ghost.
i can't turn any more.
if it gets any further, he'll be out of my sight.
what?
this is a big prison.
i can't put cameras everywhere.
show me the hole.
show me the gas chamber.
taylor, somebody should go over there and see if they're okay.
i can tell they don't look good.
he's acting.
where's scelzi then?
i don't know.
he's probably hiding somewhere.
i'll call the office.
okay, you too.
good night.
they don't know what's going on.
i feel like you're getting worse.
okay, i'll go and prove it to you.
no problem.
anyone?
i'm coming.
i'll get my camera and maybe catch some good footage.
thank you.
you should be nice to them.
you're gonna do it!
"you're gonna do the cunt."
you know what?
you're really photogenic.
you're funny, kid.
i want to do my duty now.
close the air conditioning.
come on.
connie, what do you want to do?
stop the game.
wow, this place is haunted, isn't it?
it's getting a little weird.
where'd he go?
i don't know.
i didn't see him.
he went this way.
it's a dead end.
what was that?
yeah, what was that?
shit.
taylor?
get angel on screen.
we have to get them out of there.
can you hear me?
listen to me.
there's been a change of plans.
we need to stop the show.
what?
why?
i'll be honest with you.
there's another person with you.
who?
we're not sure.
i want you to get out of there as fast as possible, okay?
are you playing games with me?
you're trying to scare me.
open the door.
i want to win and get my money.
open this door!
who opened the door?
sorry, you're not serious, are you?
idiot!
your mission is to memorize and locate the mark of the cell seven that is marked.
lucky!
in this cell, director harvis was injured deadly by a prisoner.
you're gonna find a key in that cell, and this key is gonna release your friend in the hole and in the gas chamber.
great.
was that all?
it was the easiest money i ever made.
what am i afraid of?
nothing.
angel!
stanton?
help!
well, now it's out of my sight.
hello?
who's there?
hello?
angel?
angel.
put me down.
who are you?
angel?
angel!
what... what... what... what...
it's not real.
put me down.
wait.
it's you.
no!
angel, are you okay?
he killed my brother.
he's gonna kill me, too.
he killed my brother.
new jersey school of acting.
not bad for a guy like me, is he?
connie, are you there?
yeah.
how could you organize this?
we've been through a lot.
it's gonna be a great show.
i'll see you later.
first of all, i'm gonna take this shit off.
you're an asshole.
you said you wanted a great show, right?
you got what you wanted.
yeah.
untie se toni, i'll take dixon and stanton.
okay, snow, we're cutting it.
guys, get cleaned up and change up.

excellent acting.
show's over.
toni?
good job, dixon.
okay, dixon.
it's over, man.
are you okay?
stop playing, snow.
will you say something?
we have to get them out of there.
we have to get them out of there.
get it out of my face!

london control, the package should have been in cia custody 00 minutes ago.
the car's waiting.
it's a good thing our guest isn't in a hurry.
traffic tower says they'll be moving in five minutes.
the home office closets are blown out.
we're gonna have to be a little more creative about our funding.
where the hell is oliver?
where's the airplane video?
you can break the rules, but you need a special order.
something must be done.
chief general.
i know you don't like hearing this from a politician, but reform is coming.
do you know that elevator was just for emergencies?
escort 0, what's your status?
are you restless, juney?
you'd be less nervous if you just kept being my london girlfriend.
that position won't be open for long.
i spy with my little eye open with this letter...

your operation, harry.
say again, command post?
lower your weapons and release qasim.
what the fuck are you doing, harry?
open the gates!
open the gates!
go, go, go!
command, prisoner escaped!
he's going north!
no, no!
keaton!
the command center is chasing agent 0 foot.
any more footage?
follow her.
the nearest armed unit is five minutes away.
the chopper's 00 miles away.
barriers?
in position.
the other side of the tunnel is the last one.
they have nowhere to go.
sco00.
go.
agent 0, report.
ed, wait.
agent 0, report.
repeat, the cia liaison officer has been shot.
agent 0, do you see qasim?
command, i heard a vehicle.
they shut everything down.
it's over.
the bbc can confirm that the american terrorist leader adem qasim has escaped from mi0.
apparently, the security convoy transporting qasim was attacked in the raf northolt route.
it's not war but murder because it's on the streets of the west.
because in new york, in washington, you didn't want this in london.
but the children of pakistan didn't either.
when they get hit by drone airplanes, they call it murder.
qasim offers a new kind of threat.
so far, he hasn't targeted civilians.
our models indicate the possibility of an attack within 00 hours is 00%.
the more pressure he gets under, the smaller the window is.
i can't say that under the tape rec tape recorder... but i can't
the secretary of state is coming tomorrow.
we serve the british people, not washington.
if that's not true anymore, we're already finished.
the americans think we're not serving pussy anymore.
we need a head.
i'll be relieved of duty in the morning.
didn't you hear anything about qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, what happens to me if you do?
you're out.
nobody else knows you're in qasim's web.
just go.
will holloway?
go.
how's life after mi0.
you're not part of moscow.
london needs you.
is there anyone you should say goodbye to?
thank you.
we know harry's contact with your family, so we understand that it might not be easy for you.
even if he's dead, it's okay.
harry's too arrogant to kill himself.
he was pretending to kill himself.
he went to this woman's grave.
love of your life.
harry's crew has noticed a change in harry's attitude since the woman died.
emotionally distant, cold, beginning to drink a high amount of alcohol.
water would be below 0 degrees.
he'd have hypothermia before he reached the bank.
this is the picture you said that was taken after you jumped in the snow before you entered.
before she disappeared, harry made three encrypted phone calls.
your old emergency message box.
why did he call you?
i have no idea.
the last time i talked to her was the last time she pulled me out of mi0.
he wants to talk right now.
which makes you useful.
will you help us find him?
no thanks.
and you, harry, do you talk a lot about berlin?
the night your father died?
if there's something else, mace, i have a right to know.
i don't think i can decide that... that i can decide that...
if you're not really gonna kill him, i think you told me what you wanted to tell me.
find harry, so you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
i thought i was gonna take this title to the grave.
lately, the anti-terrorist president for her majesty's security services.
funny, but who are you really?
someone who knows what these two words mean to you.
asma shishani.
go.
how'd you find me?
what do you want?
i know someone did it for me.
they never told me who they were.
of course they didn't, but you must have a connection.
one phone number, that's all.
phone number will work.
in return, i'll give you what you want.
impossible.
he said he was a human rights lawyer.
your government helped them after i put two brothers in jail.
but after i was released, the girl became too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if he's an agent, he's not one of us.
and don't worry, tell me again it's not worth anything to you.
keep her alive, she's the guarantee that i'll keep my word.
i don't need guarantees.
take him to a hospital now or the deal's off!
what she needs is mercy.
no!
she's got a daughter.
and you sent him after me?
you put her in danger, and now you're refusing to save her from pain?
how the fuck are you?
don't send a video to his family.
harry... harry... harry... harry...
you have a deal.
according to the bbc, the fugitive terrorist has no update on the capture of adam qasim.
the national threat level has been critical, so there's an attack on the eli tower.
in the economy, the ftse 000 fell again this morning and sterling continued to breathe the bills, the euros, the other funds.
there's a new intel on harry.
he's got a bad-signor fault we tracked down to kent coast.
holloway, this is classified information.
we found traces of explosives there.
you've known him longer than any of us.
do you think it's possible that qasim somehow got harry involved?
pulling him in?
i don't know.
anyway, you find harry, we find qasim.
anything for holloway?
here you go.
tomorrow, 00.
salpa 0, show a, park at bay 0.
then, open your eyes.
i hope you come alone.
just for protection.
if you can't get a crazy cold war moron without hitting it, we're in serious trouble.
i promise.
it says not yet.
until we see him, we play this through harry's.
copy that.
doors opening.
go.
ground floor.
doors opening.
open views, multiple exits.
repeat, holloway.
what harry needs to set up a meeting.
yes, mr. holloway, your uncle said he'd meet you at the coffee shop.
she left her cell phone at home.
the man in the parking lot, get rid of him.
they'd have to wear a mi0 shirt.
listen to me.
stop underestimating harry.
don't think you'll put your men in danger.
wait for him to send a signal... wait for him to send a signal... to
what is it, alpha 0?
holloway?
holloway, where are you going?
wait.
no, there's no pattern there.
don't move.
holloway, freeze!
terminal 0b.
doors closing.
he got me a flight.
pa000, plasgow plane.
i'm going to glasgow.
call the glasgow office.
get me the airport police.
priority code sigma nine.
the police want a clear path to the terminal.
and get us the permits for heathrow security.
pa000, passengers from the glasgow aircraft...
holloway, don't get in the air section.
what am i doing here, harry?
i had to find someone outside the service that i can trust.
it's a short list when you're drunk, crazy and dead.
to be honest, the only person i can tell you is someone who thinks i've ruined his life.
qasim's escape was set up by someone at the top of the service.
by one of the people who asked you to follow me.
that's why i needed to get lost.
qasim had it in his hand.
he's our only contact with the renegade.
once he's in the system, he'll be silenced.
he's planning an attack.
someone's trying to destroy themselves.
you're crazy.
ruth's death...
don't!
look for yourself, that's all i want.
what are you waiting for, harry?
mi0.
hate me all you want, but i think you believe in service, too.
what happened in berlin?
they tricked you like that?
this may not end as you'd hoped.
i'm afraid i have to tell them there's something in the lining of your jacket.
there's nothing there, but they'll have to check it out.
i'll send you a number.
call me in 00 hours, please.
i'm a security guard.
put your hands behind your back!
you just let him go.
relax, francis.
we don't want you to have a heart attack.
the deadly one.
mi0 looks like a complete liability right now, and i'm the last friend in the government.
so you're gonna have to be really nice to me right now.
in other words, is he crazy?
it's not contradictable to her last three psych evaluations.
he refused to attend.
harry pearce hasn't stopped being.
no matter how crazy he is, i still catch him...
for example.
she wanted me to help her get lost.
didn't it occur to you to accept your request and bring it to us?
don't think we can't put your life in a shitter just 'cause harry's been kicking you out of work.
since we've threatened each other, the three of you aren't hanging on a cliff or anything.
your entire organization seems to be disqualified right now.
find qasim.
fully loaded.
they're ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i saw that name when i was working on a case.
i thought they were taking you off duty.
they did.
now, what really happened?
the abduction may have been arranged by someone in the service.
you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i left it two weeks ago.
there must be one around here.
tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't.
when i was 00, i was hanging out with a kid who made money transfers.
k was interested in some people using it, so they got to me.
you started as an agent?
and when i'm done, they asked me to train as an officer.
my parents came back to me when i told them.
and if someone you're working with helped qasim escape, that would be a problem, wouldn't it?
all right.
something made me feel wrong that day.
robass, my team leader, he was in the front car with me.
he told me not to open the weapons compartment.
he ordered me to pursue.
where does he live?
loaded.
w00.
panama city.
service fund.
june, what are you... what are you... what's...
who are you?
you told me not to chase qasim.
you told me not to chase when i was my gun.
we took a vow, rob.
i'm not saying anything until i get to thames house.
we're not going to thames house.
will, what do you got?
qasim's bodyguards are deliberately weakened.
the team leader was involved.
he's just an errand boy.
find out who gave the order.
the americans think mi0.
when qasim escaped, we fell out of sight.
the cia's got it all in hand.
fire... fire... fire... fire...
he was gonna shoot.
his pulse... pulse... pulse...
dead, dead.
he's dead.
listen.
you should go home.
june!
i'll handle this, but you gotta go, now.
i've never heard a part of you get killed with that song.
who's that warrender shot the eyelash?
landon miller.
agent.
he's trying to keep his support alive, and he's hoping not to give the keys to the kingdom.
every time i see you, francis, you look like you've been buried another inch or two inches away from langley or pentagon.
you don't have to tell me.
i don't think at times like this, we shouldn't forget whose flag we've got.
francis.
i'm trying to help, but he basically accuses me of doing business for the cia.
tonight, your generals, your politicians, your spies have come together for a celebration.
tonight, we will attack the heart of their power.
our enemy, the politicians who send your sons and daughters to die in illegal wars.
spies who spy on you like you're criminals.
this war is beyond religious differences.
all the flights that's out of the united kingdoms... all the
he had it in his hand.
warrener lived.
if you have a way to get to qasim, say it now.
there's another way.
qasim's wife.
asma shishani.
she's got the fsb's hand.
if i find out where they're holding her, she'll give the traitor.
you made a deal with him.
yeah.
and if we can, he'll take us straight to him.
surrender and arrange.
how do you know the russians have her?
in exchange for a cia operative stuck in moscow.
i can reach a distance, but you need to open the secret door.
it's an address.
you're kidding.
it's the only way, will.
harry's getting help from somewhere.
i've got your old contacts, but i need access to personnel files to do it properly.
but it doesn't take you anywhere exciting.
in position.
looks like i'm gonna have to steal more extra bandwidth.
drink.
malcolm?
all right, i'm in.
i'm looking at the servers now.
harry, we gotta go.
can't we do this any faster?
i can do it.
but unfortunately, this machine is from the previous century.
g branch already pulled these out.
erin watts.
might be worth a closer look.
fill in the blanks for me.
but i got an agent.
i almost took it out.
i've been in business for less than a year.
or they make you choose late.
all right, i'll leave you alone.
is it over?
why am i sure?
i'm sorry, will.
harry.
harry!
harry, what have you done?
stay away from the computer.
i didn't feel the need to say this before, but i hope you know what you're doing.
harry's working with qasim?
he stole a whole gchq data archive.
everything we have on our western agents in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
♪ schuefeld's been seen at airport cctv. ♪
i don't know.
he didn't do that cyber attack alone.
then who's helping him?
except you.
and you're still protecting him.
why?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i'll find him.
and there's a threat.
analysis shows a large-scale attack in 00 hours, multiple targets.
an agent in charge of qasim's escape is missing.
there are signs of struggle at home.
you know anything about that?
how's your mother, holloway?
i hear it's not very good.
he hasn't packed since your father died.
understandable, really.
and then that doorbell comes in.
i know, i know.
harry was right about one thing.
you're not good enough.
home secretary, can we really hope that qasim stopped attacking again?
we've destroyed the threats of our freedom and the way we live.
your ability to hurt us can be important, but it's the end.
you'll find out that our decision has no limits.
they're not listening.
they never killed our women?
we're making the world a better place, brother.
transplant team at the airport.
we've got a warrant to cover the prisoner's way if necessary.
i think i owe you one.
you were totally right about vass.
dane.
alexanderplatz.
it's on the northeast corner of the metron, 00th.
we have a safe house.
call it nostalgia.
don't forget to bring the archive.
don't forget to bring his wife.
how'd you find me?
there's only one place to meet in berlin.
you told me.
northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
no emotionality.
this is the price of qasim's wife.
when the fsb is out of custody, qasim will give me a number.
he's taking me to the traitor.
they're gonna destroy the service where it can be defended.
get in the car, harry.
there's an old hotel 00 minutes away.
my contact could meet us there with three clean passports.
you're going home.
sorry about that.
why are you here, mrs. keaton?
keep moving, harry.
i killed someone because of you.
you're c0.
what are you doing, harry?
talent discovery.
and which one of you found it?
jesus christ, will.
preparation is everything.
vass?
when he came to my house, i told him.
i thought someone was asking about qasim's escape.
they tied me to the command center, and they told me what to do.
they went to vass's house before we did, and they planted the evidence.
i got vass to escape.
you think i want to do it?
i know my duty.
i'm the only one who knows.
you were set up.
he's right, will.
but i wonder if miss keaton's sure about me.
it was a secure chain of command.
what was i supposed to do?
do you believe him?
yeah.
i'm sure your men will come and find you if you're still useful.
after all this was over, what did you think they were gonna do to you?
i did what they asked me to do.
we're changing the deal.
we're taking qasim's wife to london.
tell him he can't see his wife again if he doesn't care for himself.
let's go get her.
what happened to alexanderplatz?
a sudden agoraphobia feeling.
i'm afraid there was something wrong with qasim's wife.
at least be good enough to put it in my car.
harry.
colonel.
i don't like being polite, but we're gonna need your clothes.
while the search for adam qasim intensifies, everyone who travels through the united kingdom's national line of united states has to show valid id and access the valet.
i have your wife.
let me talk to him.
the russians put him to sleep and... and... the russians
bullshit.
i'm bringing your wife to london.
no.
i'll tell your whore you said goodbye.
is the baby too much?
no, it's just you.
i trusted june.
you were right to take me off duty.
despite everything i've done, you're still trying to do something good here.
i won't let your sacrifices be in vain.
it was here.
was it quick?
he could have left me, but he chose not to quit.
if you try anything, anything, i can't guarantee anyone's safety.
no one.
you bring my wife, i'll give you your phone number.
here we go.
hello?
holloway.
this message came from h. division.
me.
we can catch qasim, but we need help.
and let's go.
one clean choice, hannah.
trust me, and help me.
or go.
do it well or do it very well, right?
shit.
they're getting closer to the location.
the algorithm that i wrote last night is constantly updating itself, reviewing all potential points of view.
well, he's not cutting water, then?
please.
all right, we're here.
how much time do we have?
i'm looking at 000 cameras.
give me something.
once he realizes we're playing him, he's gone.
wait.
he worked 00 seconds ago.
are you sure?
yes, confirmed.
camera disabled in the last minute.
0th floor, east corner.
harry, we have to stall.
i have to hope you're looking at us exactly.
yeah?
it's called the south.
i have his wife.
you're supposed to look south.
give me the number.
give me the number or we'll leave.
turn around now or you'll die.
here.
him too.
i haven't got it yet.
you have 0 seconds to turn around.
turn.
maybe this guy never saw her.
almost there.
him?
kill.
give me the number.
don't!
stop!
no!
okay?
will, she's fine.
the shooter is dead.
then it's over.
malcolm, feather.
yeah?
my wife's dead, isn't she?
harry, listen.
let hannah report us.
harry?
hannah, why did harry remove the earphones?
i don't know.
let us know.
get sco00.
four truck full of rdx, leaving limehouse north industries park in the next 00 minutes.
how do you know?
qasim just told me.
in 00 minutes, trucks loaded with bombs leaving.
i think we got him.
let's go!
armed police!
stay where you are!
clear!
clear!
the primary target?
negative!
negative!
negative, sir.
command, area clear.
harry.
he sold his own men.
why would he do that?
what did you do?
armed police!
freeze!
move!
you have to tell them everything, harry.
i think we have a lot to talk about.
this might be a bit out of line.
since the southwest corner of alexanderplatz.
keep an eye on holloway.
make sure he's safe.
maybe we won't be so hasty.
did you find qasim?
harry will.
you still don't know him.
qasim gave up his entire operation.
what did you tell him?
i should have thought they'd release you after berlin.
they want to offer you a deal.
throw everything on harry and go.
i told them i'd leave it after i did it.
there's no way out.
i can't.
there's an emergency backup key standing around your neck.
whatever you're up to... whatever you're
what would ruth think?
what did you give him?
check the back.
southwest corner.
i found harry at the northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
the opposite.
where you're gonna trap somebody.
harry?
i gave you to him.
get down!
get down!
get down!
lock us up.
get down!
get down!
we're not here for you!
we came for them.
get down!
think of your families.
hamza.
why?
there are 00 men on the other side of these doors.
you must surrender.
come here.
open up!
if you think we're gonna negotiate... we're gonna negotiate a
open the door.
but he'll kill us.
there's too many demons in a room.
the only way to get out of here alive is to surrender... to surrender... to
you think i want to get out?
how many people's lives began to end in this room?
my people's lives.
your people?
no one asked you to speak for them, kill for them.
if you want a hostage...
i think he's made it clear he's not interested in hostages.
i'm the director of mi0.
kill me and put the gun down.
otherwise, you're nothing but a dead terrorist.
no one will see you as a hero.
when we're done, you're gonna be a drunk, tattooing your wife, a powerless head.
a few marrakech male prostitutes, and we give them free tickets to disneyland in return for saying you begged them to piss on you.
we can't remember you very well, can we, adam?
wait, wait, wait.
i pulled the chopper back.
but...
you fucking coward.
i thought you were fighting a higher standard.
i'm sorry for your wife's death, adam.
i know what this can do to you.
is that supposed to stop me?
it's okay.
stop!
why did you bring him here?
i made a choice.
without a plan b.
why do you think i kept you out of that room?
people are still dead, harry.
less than the ones who will die in the blast.
what choice would you make?
this is my job.
auntie, can you come play outside?
hi, geraldine.
finally, it comes down to who says the longest-time lie.
right?
if we had protected that morning, qasim would never have escaped.
you ordered the met's air unit to turn down all mi0 requests, didn't you?
that's the advantage of being a lonely maniac.
i don't need to prove it.
sacrificing his own service so he can be questioned by a foreign power.
the americans would have made you the general manager, no doubt.
how many more lives was that promotion worth?
what did you think you did, harry?
the service is dying.
but the moment i realized i was on the loser side, my career would be too short.
blowing my brain off, finding my 00-year-old niece...
i think it's from you.
what is it?
the thin intestine is going crazier than four hours or unstoppable bleeding.
no trace.
how clever.
i was afraid that was the answer.
that's why i took the chance to choose.
it's not lunch that makes you sick.
i ate a cattle rib.
tell me you're lying, harry.
please.
tell me you didn't betray your country.
it's been four hours, geraldine.
you can spend the last three hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd go out and play with your beautiful niece.
i'm thinking.
your message said you'd tell me something.
they're spying on ruth's grave.
you can't leave now.
ben, there's actually something you should be.
your father was wearing this the night he died.
stasi, he's taken out everything that's gonna work, and he's figured out a way to get into the fsb archive somewhere.
he was wearing a wedding ring the night of his operation?
i didn't kick you out of your ass because you're not good enough.
after your father, i couldn't... couldn't... do it
i should have protected you.
the good don't last forever, will.
then who does?
they're like me.
if you know your problem and tell the men at the gate, it'll help.
hotel junior high has room for every guest.
single file.
these new problems are killing in the dark.
these people will be grateful to you when the darkness falls.
i think we should keep them here to keep them safe, but i'm worried things are getting worse.
they have no idea who caused the dark matter.
besides, it's not what's hiding in the dark that we need to worry about.
we still haven't figured out how to lift that fog wall.
maybe it's a blessing.
this was the latest from in-flight safety.
i'm on your side, and i might need a new job.
i've got it under control, but if i can get another pillow for my beauty sleep, it's gonna be fine.
try to make things right.
we talked about this.
it's almost impossible to destroy the problem without killing someone with a problem.
of course, i just need impossible materials and information that i don't have.
i'm gonna need a team.
do you have any idea what's going on?
but there's a bad element.
it's the only way to protect the rest of us.
it's risky to drive because of the magnet problem.
an engineer to help fix the power plant.
he volunteered as soon as he knew.
if things don't work out, you can use his problem for the operator.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
the untraceable killer is out there somewhere.
and i think he wants to prove to you that he really wants to help.
okay, well, whatever the reason, look after her for me, okay?
because we're both immune to new problems.
i'm not saying it's just my mom.
i'll call the person who caused the dark matter at school when you're gone.
he stole those batteries and put us in danger.
there was no choice, dwight.
it's the third case in two weeks.
now the serial killer is in this building.
okay, i'm gonna go talk to dwight.
my father always said you were a good man.
mara's father?
there may be a way, but if you want me to explain it, it might look a little scary, so don't ask me to.
even on the map, i can't find maine, haven.
are you telling me you can't find a town with 00 grand?
that didn't cause problems.
then why didn't we use aether in the first place to end the problems?
i can't bring it when the pearls are sealed.
so how do we find it?
gloria brought a box of stuff that duke left in gull.
i don't think william has the amount of aether i need, and aether is just the first step.
you told his wife you'd find him.
it's easy to make a decision on the edge, but sometimes things aren't what they look
i have a town to protect.
no wonder the plant is working at 00%.
guys, i'll try, but remember, i've never done anything like this before.
they parked the car here so i could talk to you, but i don't have enough money to pay for the oil change.
if everything goes well, i'll be back with aether before the sun goes down.
this is peggy's husband, rolf.
enough panic and fear.
the same killer who killed my son 00 years ago?
we call him "the killer who didn't leave a trace."
what else are you hiding from me, vince?
dwight's doing everything he can to make the rules admit it, but he's not the guy to kill people.
in this haven, banishment is the same as executing death.
thanks to our friend there, we're keeping them in some kind of prison.
he says the generator works at 00 percent.
damn, the generator must have unloaded the energy reserves when it overloaded.
that would explain the department electricity to this town.
at this rate, five minutes or so.
it's almost over, and it's the only thing that protects us from dying in the dark.
here, i've rearranged the generator to get power to the town faster, but there's nothing more we can do.
they better turn.
help each other.
lamps around you.
share supplies.
you see, i'm happy here.
i got your message.
get in the car now.
come on, jump!
if war lies ahead, we should be thankful, even slean.
i don't think you have anything worse than being in love.
i don't like it here.
every story has two sides.
whoever's behind this is a traitor.
let's go.
he asked me to represent him at slean's wedding.
court, you are my brother's love.
that's why you're practically my brother.
you've seen bigger places here in the iraqi realms.
none of them were ruled by a woman.
you must choose a second to escort you and watch your interests during the ritual.
then you'll listen to the bonds of friends and relatives.
i have no relatives here.
my mom and the others will accompany you.
kela, this is the palace from bregan.
rheda, does she always have to be guarding me?
i don't really get it.
but i know i should marry slean.
i'll love him.
this marriage can't happen.
abrecan trusts you.
what do you do for a living?
carpenter.
they can use you on the wall, then.
who are you?
a friend of the chairman.
like i said, i have work to attend to.
we need to figure out how to handle it.
varr said i couldn't accept gifts.
well, we'll keep it, then.
every bride needs to smell good when the wedding comes.
remember, it's our secret.
sit down.
we'll get what we'll get when they look at the injured.
you wanted to talk?
all right.
kela, it's time for your ritual.
elvina, are you gonna be the second person i have with me?
for the game.
we need to talk sometime.
we need to discuss why the marriage doesn't work.
if we don't fulfill our mission, their marriages may be canceled.
beowulf!
let's celebrate.
by old customs!
the dress smells like a slut.
i'm so sorry.
it was just a little mistake.
that's all.
we're gonna help slean give the symbol to his bride.
sounds easy.
breca!
open the door!
come on, you stinking mudborn.
come on!
come on!
give me your arm.
come on!
slean.
be quiet, it's bald.
are they ready for this marriage?
i don't understand why slean wouldn't want to marry kela.
i don't think so.
he must put his feelings aside and do what's best for everyone.
would you put it aside for others?
that's what we all have to do.
if someone spends their whole life pleasing others, then that person doesn't exist.
it must make you feel pretty free to think that way.
try.
tell every rock the truth.
but then you can look at each other and light the fire that symbolizes your marriage.
then you'll be husband and wife.
have you ever loved someone before?
no.
before you came here... you...
do you want to be a thane?
tell my uncle i'm done with him.
yeah.
come on!
go!
you let him go.
we're not done here yet.
don't you understand?
i betrayed my mother and set up a mop with my uncle.
this woman was sent here to kill you!
i don't know.
really?
i killed my brother.
he was the one who was supposed to be with him today.
even if the world were destroyed, mara had everything.
people loved him because he was kind.
my father loved him for his first child.
rowan and lovers.
then i had the opportunity to escape.
i didn't need anything.
he died of humor, but that's him.
he was getting better.
i poisoned him.
slean, i'm not gonna tell anybody what happened here today and what happened.
or stay.
i know, but it's beowulf's.
he went to bed last night.
but we can choose who we can draw our fate with.
fire with me.
you want to be a thane?
i can help you.
against those who oppose you.
they can't take it from you anymore, rheda.
with this marriage, you're the j earl of shieldlands.
these rules of jarl must be used by any tribe.
if the blood isn't paid, a killer's life will be terminated.
the thieves will be branded and cast out of society.
all the merchandise in the shieldlands will be determined by jarl.
what right does he have to identify the price of fish?
we're the ones who risk their lives to catch the pandiri every summer.
you should have told me about these rules.
you were where your people needed you the most, on guard.
i couldn't distract him.
it was messy enough.
you're late for pandiri.
some people think you missed him again.
but if you fail, bregan will be in misery and open the winter.
breca's wanted for murder, you know it.
kill him!
kill breca now!
i got it!
if you do it without any explanation, we're all dead.
after he escaped the gallows, he hired us to turn breca into his blood.
we wanted to ask the guy who helped him escape the first time?
that's why we're gonna welcome this.
but we gotta keep breca.
as we speak, heorot may be standing at our gates!
when did we kill young women sometime?
what do you mean?
you've been hiding in the shadows too long, abrecan.
remember who you're talking to.
speak.
he wants breca's life or blood money for the murder of his brother.
i didn't mean to kill anyone.
hurry!
thank you.
breca made my mother fall in love with herself.
he's looking for the dents he thinks he's got, and then he's stealing the money, and he's running away.
he left my mother and took everything that was precious to him.
my brother came after you.
but it cost you your life.
breca, is it true?
i'll pay for your brother's blood.
lila, do you have 00 silver coins?
i don't want money, i want blood!
silence!
breca's free if the blood is paid.
you lied to me.
pandiri.
pandiri!
tie him up now.
get ready, they're coming.
i saw it.
get out!
the council is assembled.
he wants to take my place when i'm wasting the crap out of my hand.
you let me down, slean married keela, rheda became jarl!
you don't understand.
tell the council our enemies are gathering, that your sister cannot rule, that you want to save shields.
so tell me you're distracted.
say it.
sorry.
i knew breca killed someone, but the story he told me was different.
it's only his fault.
lila, no one thinks bad things about you...
that's all i got.
you did?
there's not 00 silver in here.
not enough.
and i'm gonna hold breca while i see that job.
was there enough money?
lila?
shut it down, beowulf, please.
you're not talking to lila.
get on your horse, leave herot and never come back.
there's no room for you here anymore.
i want to fight properly if herot's being attacked.
if herot's going to be attacked, i'll protect you.
let's try.
this isn't about mudborn.
i don't want to talk about him.
i want to know why you lied about teaching me.
it's wasted on you.
you don't even want to be personal.
yeah?
i didn't know we were training the blacksmiths!
go.
now!
he fights girls now?
the landscape was more like he was training the blacksmith.
i know you think i let you down.
i can't focus on my duties in bregan.
but i have my reasons.
you're talking about betrayal on one of your own blood.
we need a warrior at the center of this land!
someone who'll take his people out of the darkness.
a man in power who will take control!
you're talking about betraying your sister to conceal the fact that you can't afford your people.
what's the point of having fish if we're all going to be slaughtered?
i'm here to give our thane the vote of insecurity.
those against abrecan being a thane.
it's decided.
a new thane will be appointed and the morning will be announced.
get up.
next.
nobody.
don't think this is a game!
we're lazy, distracted.
this is gonna work out here.
from now on, we'll work like my father hrothgar.
i didn't mean to interrupt.
you're a good teacher.
a great thane needs a strong army behind him.
we don't have to share the same bed, but if we don't share the same room, people will talk.
i always liked watching herot from here.
it looks like it's never been eaten.
if i tell mom the truth, i'll lose her trust.
and a chance to rule one day.
what if abrecan attacks?
herot might fall.
no advice?
i trust you.
your decision will be right.
i'll be there when i do.
you'll be thane.
you just have to believe.
pandiri.
pandiri!
it's the pandiri!
play the horn!
i order you, steal the horn!
abrecan, stop it.
if we don't act now, we'll get the opportunity out of our hands.
why... why... why... why...
you, help me carry the net.
help me carry the net now.
why don't you help me?
pandiri!
come on, hurry up!
go find me a sack.
people shouldn't leave their valuables lying around.
you owe mom an apology.
but i'm a warrior, and our honor is at stake.
so i'm gonna take your life.
go back to mommy, little girl.
hi.
i didn't need your help.
because he didn't have enough money to save you.
thank god you didn't kill him, vishka.
if we don't plant the net, our prey will be out of our hands.
no, he's not.
stand by.
abrecan, no!
hold the rope steady!
hurry, they'll eat you raw!
pandiri, pandiri!
pandiri, pandiri!
hold on!
now get back!
take a look.
there will be songs about this hunt.
a catch you guys won.
i have a dream about us.
being the biggest tribe in shieldlands!
we're not going to match the laws that a jarl can't even hold a sword.
who's with me?
abrecan, abrecan, abrecan!
i have to warn beowf.
bregan!
elvina!
his warriors are coming together.
this time they intend to destroy us.
beowulf!
if we turn around today, we'll see that more danger and harm come from religious beliefs.
my wife, if i were to talk about stand-up demonstrations about soviet communism or stalin's violence, it would be less embarrassing.
it's the status of the philosophy of interrogation, the things that cause problems to humans, especially the way they are.
presenting a situation that is perfectly true in itself can cause serious damage.
when the prophecies don't occur, we make fun of those people, and the whole world makes fun of us.
i had a friendly disagreement with richard dawkins about the problem.
maybe we should be more aggressive with richard.
especially america is surrounded by christian faith.
they're sure the world is as it sounds.
we'll get rid of the bad guys.
i'd like to write a book like this, if i could.
but of course, one of my fears is what happens next.
what kind of chaos?
how right is it to do that to people who think that religion is protecting us from civilization and good in our hearts?
religion is like moral viagra for many people.
if that's true, if the religion is to guide people's moral lives, then anybody's gonna have to crawl forward with us, and get the hell out of the way.
'cause there's a lot of people down there, and we can make a chaos out of people's fear.
a lot of people want their lives to mean something, and where does that come from?
but there must be something better than religion.
yeah, there's definitely hope.
let's see what happens.
of course.
at least you didn't get a piercing.
i don't know how to explain this to amy.
i'm the stupidest man in the world.
all right, stop it.
i'm the stupidest man in the world.
okay, you win this.
i can't find emma's papers.
honey, just so you know, you can't return the baby even if you find the original receipt.
i have to find the paper that angela signed when she left emma on my doorstep, and she gave me the only regent.
i'm finally gonna get myself health insurance for what i'm responsible for looking after.
i haven't spoken to emma since the night we made emma.
calm down.
you gave me all the important papers about the baby to be safe.
you got all the papers?
her father's daughter is a big girl.
maybe something with a balloon.
it looks good!
you robbed a clown?
it's your birthday!
my first birthday is tomorrow.
you used to party all the time when you were a kid.
after celebrating my birthday...
happy birthday, miley."
you know those papers i kept for me?
how irresponsible do you think i am?
but i...
i may have posted them in time, but she couldn't mail them, and i couldn't have the sole owner of emma.
we were all so excited about the new baby, and i didn't have a stamp!
look, we've got angela to sign this document and we'll be fine.
you're ben's best friend and you're the only one who's seen the girl... because you're the only one who
i like it very much, all right.
okay, emma's finally asleep.
hey, danny, why doesn't riley want to celebrate his birthday?
really, why does he hate it so much?
ben, riley didn't celebrate her birthday since her 00 years of disaster.
you sure you want to watch this?
i think i'd remember if it was a disaster.
all right, come on, guys.
danny, where are we going?
fortunately, he won a real mustache and lost a lot of personality weight in the future.
me here too?
benjamin wheeler, come here and celebrate riley's birthday.
okay, i can tell you this is my best birthday ever.
tell me you didn't do anything to the cake.
actually, try to save it with a perm first and then cut it out.
is riley still in love with ben, or is this something that happened when we were kids?
unless you're still in love with riley.
i ruined her sweet 00 birthday party.
it's not in her birthdays, but the rest of the days she loves you, for sure.
well, if ben is so irresponsible to lose the papers, and he's so afraid to face me, maybe he doesn't deserve to take emma's attorney alone.
if it makes you feel any better, we do most of the work.
i can imagine how difficult it is to leave emma.
i knew you'd finally feel sorry for her, even if you thought it was so funny or wonderful!
on the streets of your peace, city streets, the elite u.s. army tank unit, slave trooper, destroyed in three minutes, only three minutes, only three minutes.
as madox-00.
what's more, a uh-00 has more damage power than blackhawk.
it's perfect for anti-terrorist and anti-gerilla operations.
miss kusumoto is also the chief architect of the software for "tankbuster."
today's show, in order to put madox's abilities on his behalf, he went into the cabin of a pilot to be able to put on his own.
unit 0 is going to ichigaya tonight.
we're in a hurry, so try to be quick as you can.
and...
miss kusumoto, you've made me quite humiliated today.
i'm not here for congratulations.
there's only one thing i'm gonna tell you:
wow!
kouji... kouji... kou
what is it?
onose, you leave this to me!
they just threw away their trash.
i'm telling you, don't worry.
i'll buy you dinner in return, won't i?
sdf's transport truck...
the report shows that the event was quite natural... to be encountered with this case... and it was
it's obviously terrorist work.
you're way too foreign to the east-bloc operation.
i hope you know what you're saying!
i hope you see the burden of the accident is entirely yours.
either way, the situation we're in is critical.
we had him transferred to the field test!
it's a mess!
i have to be in the operation myself.
besides, madox-00.
we're having trouble searching the crime scene.
should we get some backup from the police on the phone?
we have to prepare ourselves for the worst and prepare for help troops.
i'm the only one who can go up against the madox and get his head on.
lieutenant kilgore is one of the most good tankers in the army, although he is one of the most obvious.
is this-- is it okay?
there's nobody in the building?
anyway, i'm a little relieved.
shiori really was a pretty girl...
when he goes to study in england, all the boys in japan will mourn.
where did you learn that?
he called me in the morning and asked me to give you a message.
use the open switch to open it.
it burns!
the pilot could be adjusted.
it feels like he's wearing a boat to slide.
we've got a signal to activate the madox.
it's a disaster.
could you heat it up in the microwave?
i really fucked up!
shiori, what do you intend to do?
defense?
you're on your way to the prototype airborne tank.
don't you dare turn tokyo into vietnam!
tokyo or vietnam, it's all the same fights for me.
you're gonna be a disaster.
oh, my god, don't be alarmed.
i'm gonna get over it before it gets too hot.
lieutenant kilgore is using the most advanced tank and anti-tank chopper choppers, and i promise him that the madox is on his mission to get it back.
in that case, there'll be a big panic downtown.
in the circumstances, there must be someone who can stop kilgore and madox.
what can we do?
we don't know madox's target yet.
if i can find him before lieutenant kilgore, then maybe i'm on the verge that we have a chance.
but madox's condition...
i'm gonna use unit 0 out of the power test successful.
how much luck?
hey, you heard me!
wait for me.
that's it!
how's it going!
what are you doing on the road?
i can't stand by the side of the road like a pavement stone!
you're a real driver, man!
there's plenty more to finish the installments!
he's back in the cabriolet!
bye, assholes!
really, the saturdays people were trapped near shinjuku.
i can't lose my mark in this crowd!
this "madox" must be really valuable.
spider 0 to jackal 0.
aim!
he's moving on his own... acting on his
one of the apaches was dropped.
all units are authorized by the authority to destroy madox.
just like kilgore wanted.
he's on his way to the skyscrapers and skyscrapers.
the civilians must evacuate immediately!
they're all over me!
i'm gonna go over there and use the west exit.
there's an armored lunatic coming up!
all right, back to work, madox!
i hear you.
and i say, "you're a headache."
if anyone's involved in the chaos, it's you.
just what?
none of your business.
i can't do anything i don't understand!
no!
all right, captain!
"cr parking spot - parking spot - parking spot - "
exit exit exit exit" exit exit exit
i did it!
shiori upstairs!
i'm not gonna let you take another step.
i can't fight it!
i can't waste any more time with you!
i thought you were an amateur so i shouldn't be nice to you.
time to stop jumping around.
it's not gonna happen!
he's just a kid!
what were you trying to do with all this?
my name is sugimoto kouji, sophomore at kanto institute of technology.
i just wanted to meet my girlfriend at the nsr building.
first he locked me in, then he dropped his own chopper.
i got you.
miss kusumoto, this is spider 0 speaking, this is kilgore.
really, i saw your show.
you fight pretty hard.
i'll take care of whatever it takes, personally, in the varota headquarters.
hey, where are the civilians in the building?
what's so important?
as you think of me, why am i going crazy?
he's got madox on his target.
he'll come after you to destroy him.
most of all, i know how to walk and use my hands.
you got it.
it's either the or you kill kilgore!
they've damaged my legs.
i can't move anymore.
you think i can beat him?
you were fine when we were fighting.
did you read the entire manual?
hey, madox.
adi it!
come and kill me!
couldn't you just go a little harder and up my "pay"?
l-l-t!
what happened, you turned around like a turtle!
if you can't do this much, you're gonna stain on the name of tankbuster!
your tricks don't work on me!
kouji!
coming!
you're brave!
i'm tired of the cats-fare game!
you fell into my medical trap!
if i fall, i'll take you with me, madox!
it's a mess with madox!
i've got some very important things to tell you, shiori.
paul wouldn't hurt anyone.
" cannot be" cannot be fixed."
i'm not your mother, brian.
you don't even like me.
are you really staying?
everything wasn't clear.
i haven't even written my time yet.
there's a sound on the right.
can they sew it up again?
what's your mother's name?
am i reacting to the drugs?
yeah, but searching his room would be rape his privacy.

what are you gonna do with this baby?
you gonna give it to the cops?
what, am i gonna say i changed my mind and come back?

a woman abandons her own child on a train!
you see, he doesn't want it.
i'm gonna change your underwear now!
let me look after the gun for you, okay?

i have more important things to do than deal with this kind of nonsense.
you give me the gun, i'll hide it somewhere, okay?
give me the tables.
why did you put it there, man?
take it!

it's a kid her mother doesn't want, brother.
what are you doing, brother?
what's the matter with you, man?
why are you acting like a bitch?
who are you, brother, jeremy kyle or something?
you can't sell someone's baby to someone else!
especially vince and carol.
the other day, we were selling junkies to this man!
no, you didn't, because he doesn't want to, man.
they're gonna give this kid to another vince and carol.
let me go, brother.
i told you i would, man.
what am i gonna tell people now?
yeah, yeah, good.
yes, but don't tell anyone we're here!
just take half, give me the rest.
i can't believe you even sold a baby!
you didn't want it before, did you?
if i'm gonna go through all this stress, i'm gonna lose the money, and i'm gonna lose everything, so i need you to talk to someone properly, okay?
a nice lady.
i'm in the "fuck me" situation.
what's going on there?
you sell drugs in a bar, don't you?
either you or your stupid brother took my gun and i need that gun.
you have 0 hours to get my gun back, or i'll have people throw their houses away.
i'm going.
it's always messing up, isn't it?
when my wife's upstairs, why are you bringing this bitch to my place?
what's going on?
he had problems with a sturdy russian mafia who's got a lot of trouble everywhere.
he thought they were gonna kill the baby.
that's why he left the baby on the train.
now, take this money and i'll give you the rest when i meet ed.
it's not fake, vince, and you know it!
you don't get it when you don't have a dick in your mouth, do you?
it's not a problem when i've got your dick in my mouth, but alone!
no, he said your dick was in his mouth.
i'm not giving them the baby!
they can't get it either!
calm down, okay?
now get upstairs and get that baby!
over here!
my gun!
just know he's dead to give it to you.
they may not let you go because you have no family.
what flowers would like, do you have any suggestions?
white roses are good, aren't they?
fuck it!
fuck you!
are you the owner of this vehicle?
but you stopped me for nothing.
but before that, let's raise our glasses to the new owner, chester.
to chester.
i'm hoping he'll shiver on these great monsters like i've done for years.
cheers.
i promise i'll raise the standards of this show and you'll be proud.
bon voyage to where dreams come true.
thank god.
even if that big-faced german go off, we'll take over the reign.
marjorie, it's a shame... so shame... so...
thank you, chester.
now, if you'll excuse me, the whole family, the monsters and strange community-- spend your last moments alone.
bye.
there's someone else to thank.
mr. richard spencer.
our lives have completely changed their course.
cheers.
mm!
but tonight we'll have a nice feast, and then we'll see a movie from my own collection.
not the sign of the cross again.
no.
we're gonna watch freaks tonight.
do you know this movie, richard?
i can't say i know.
it's a great movie.
tell me about it, eve, paul.
oh.
cleopatra is a normal kind of trapeze artist, and he's married to a dwarf who does little shows.
but the whole point is to poison him and put him in his legacy.
he makes all the freaks play on his finger until one day he's drunk and out of his real intentions.
then all freaks turn against him.
one night they take their revenge with knives and guns.
eve, eve.
darling... don't say the end and miss your taste.
that sounds great!
there's a lot to do before we head west.
i can't.
shut up and sit down.
you deserve it.
what happened to you?
come on, richard, open up.
i've been thinking about you for a long time.
oh, thank god.
when we saw our show, we had some stunning customers, but... no one's ever loved one before.
are you all right, ma'am?
where are those security guards?
good to know.
and now you.

i'm right.
he killed her.
he's not who you think he is.
and start running.
run!
run!
run!
just because you grew up without a father, you don't need to romanticize the job right now because he's dead.
how did he die?
who killed him?
we all did.
he broke the rule.
now.
come on.
he was my father!
he killed a freak!
the most delicate of all.
you believe his word?
this fraud bitch?
i saw dear ma petite in a jar with my own eyes.
i've heard you've wasted it on my own ears.
as for maggie, if she hadn't helped, we'd have more bodies.
i won't forgive him.
all i want is a rot in hell.
you're gonna be friends with whoever it is right now.
maggie's gonna change her bandages.
no!
keep the dirty ones.
it's up to me to protect you and protect you because your mother's not here anymore.
i've seen you grow from childhood to man and man to man-- and we need you.
i don't have hands!
i can't even pee on my own.
i found an old friend.
he'll come and help you.
he's a real artist.
but first the wounds need to heal.
maggie's gonna help you.
let him.
i'm so sorry.
i hate hurting you.
really?
i thought it was your only talent-- hurting people.
i love you, jimmy.
this part is real.
i always have.
i want to make a fresh start.
we can still go to new york like we planned.
why not?
you're kidding, right?
after all you've done, do you think we're just going to sail into the new horizon?
my hands... are in a fucking jar, and you're responsible for all this.
i'm so sorry.
can you bring maite back from the dead?
huh?
i've changed, jimmy.
ow!
i knew you were stupid, let's add blind to your list, shall we?
find me someone who'll fix me the lamp focus!
i can't leave.
i gotta get the right light for the first time, okay?
try again now!
whatever!
elsa.
of course.
he's watching us.
can't we?
just this once?
please?
okay.
yeah.
mm.
oh.
thank you, chester.
you put me down.
like an old sock.
i'm sorry, marjorie.
i got a little... carried away, but i'm happy now.
they have magic shows, you exist.
maybe i should go.
we can manage, marjorie.
the twins accepted you.
they just don't want you watching you do it.
they're using you, chester.
you're their boss now.
no, they don't.
they love me.
you're a murderer.
no, no.
no.
marjorie.
i know you don't like to talk about it, so don't mention it, but you killed them.
and alice and lucy.
impossible.
i'm just a puppet.
hmm.
love destroys you, chester.
you're losing control.
i know... i know... i know...
i'm a monster.
you don't need them.
i'm in.
i know.
please don't leave me, marjorie.
twins?
they have to go.
i know.
they will.
ethel here looks great with the chorus girls.
oh, this is her barnum day.
she was a unique woman.
to ethel.
to ethel.
so what do you say?
didn't anybody hear what spencer said last night?
now everything's settled.
elsa killed ethel.
forest.
car accident.
it was all a setup.
i believe that.
that crazy, vindictive woman threw a knife at my paul.
all elsa cares about is elsa.
i didn't get it in my head anyway.
i know ethel.
he wasn't someone to kill himself.
he's not a coward.
he wouldn't do that to his own kid, and so would we.
and he'd leave a decent note.
if someone comes after one of us, we know what to do.
our future has only one security.
and that elsa isn't alive.
have you ever dreamt you could feel that way, dot?
thank god you said the marjorie thing.
all he had to do was push him.
i think we've certainly had a good reputation on it.
good evening, girls.
what are you doing here?
i'm here to extend a friendly x-tind.
i've learned a little bit about your last duties.
we don't want to hear anything from you.
leave nicely.
oh, dot, i can't blame you.
i showed a terrible act the other day.
but the recent events have made my hard feelings go soft.
i lost my mother.
it was so sudden and... terrible.
she's very upset, dandy.
it's horrible for everyone to lose a mother.
it was.
it is.
and it made me feel like i shouldn't let the people i loved.
but i think you should know we're seeing a man.
actually, i got your news.
you have no idea what a mighty glorious situation it would be to marry you.
if i had the chance to put it all to rest, believe me...
i came with friendly feelings.
i know i lost my chance.
i'm not half the man you deserve.
but i asked myself.
"daddy, what do you have to do to support the girls you love so much?"
and then it occurred to me that i could protect you, and that's why i hired a decent man to gather information about your new friend.
it broke my heart because your chester creb is a complete freak!
we don't need to look at these.
what's the matter with you?
you're a pain in the ass, and we don't trust you as much as our sins.
ta-ta, then.
i did my best.
my mom always used to argue with a woman when she was angry.
who is it?
son.
here.
drink.
what's that?
penicillin.
i would hate to see you die of an infection when i said we'd complete you.
who are you?
my name is massimo dolcefino.
i'm here to make you your new hands.
okay?
massimo is an old friend of mine from before the war.
he's a master of art.
no, no.
i've seen soldiers with a bomb on their hands.
they got their hands on those cool hooks.
i can't do anything, but at least i can keep my cigarettes on my own.
and i don't have to be afraid of the wood dryers for the rest of my life.
massimo offers you something more elegant than rusty hooks.
more convincing.
look.
see?
so's the other one.
massimo saved my life.
your mom would've died of booze and she'd leave you hungry on the streets.
i could have married her if you weren't so stupid.
"my only sin..."
si.
"he loved you..."
very much and very much very much very much
no!
they were members of an organization.
and if he's the leaders, he's a doctor.
now go to the other one, don't hurry this time.
for two years, two years, two years, two years,
massimo took care of me.
he taught me to walk.
and dance.
and then hindburg fell.
nurmberg, rhineland...
we were supposed to get away while we could.
we had plans.
how could i look my love in the eyes when i knew those monsters were free?
they needed to pay.
i hunted them all one by one.
aah!
finally, i've reached the leader.
oh, the beasts' head.
doctor hans grouper.
it shouldn't have been a painless death.
obviously my death wouldn't be painless either.
he took it very personal that i wanted to kill him.
very personal.
she tortured me.
he locked me in a cell and tortured me again, and again.
how did you survive?
i lived in austria until the end of the war.
then i came to america-- at 00.
and i called miss mars for years.
but i couldn't get an answer.
if you loved him so much, and you knew where he was, why didn't you just walk out on his feet?
my body survived the torture, but...
i was like a pinocchio.
there was nothing left in me for humanity.
but, uh...
good irony.
good irony.
i know you've been sobered up, and it might be hard to change for a show.
and i repeat-- this has nothing to do with ego.
for this continuity... this continuity... is for
he looks so normal.
i don't think we can judge him if we don't have absolute proof.
what about the file?
it says he killed his wife.
you're letting dandy's lies cloud your judgment.
dot and i have something we need to say.
we don't want to be your assistant anymore.
why?
we just... we don't want to.
maybe when you hear my final, you'll change your mind.
two bodies, two heads.
it's gonna make a lot of noise.
first in the history of magician.
come on, girls... let's rehearse.
we're not going in that box.
no, chester... we're not going in that box.
now excuse me...
i will.
you... you... you... you...
i can be your assistant.
it is.
get in the box, lucy.
my name's maggie.
oop!
is that your magic act?
it's kind of pathetic.
shut up.
i didn't say anything.
what are you looking at?
backstage.
it's called the original saw.
tonight, you'll be watching a very dangerous version of this game of mine.
cuffs.
hey, i...
i don't know this part.
i went to war for you.
you should have died there.
we loved each other.
and you've come back with a metal plate in your head and a buzzing bees in your head.
chester, stop, i can't move my feet!
stop!
stop talking!
you're distracting me.
stop, marjorie.
haven't you ruined my life enough?
you're nothing without me.
i'll show you.
all of you.
chester!
chester!
chester, stop!
what are you doing?
relax, people... it's just a magic show.
magic show.
i can call him back.
again... again... again... again...
alakazam!
abraka...
abracadabra.
that's gonna be a lot of people, chester.
he made me do it.
he deserved it.
what do we do now?
steal your jewels and bury the bitch.
why are you packing?
you ruined everything again.
time to go.
you confused me.
you did it consciously to sabotage me.
i finally found happiness.
i'm going.
you can't leave without me.
oh.
i loved you.
chester... chester... chester... chester... chester
oh, god...
marjorie?
stay with me.
marjorie.
in the interest of elsa, dayton, 0000 in front of you, my favorite son-of-the-lovest son-of-the-lover-at-the-lover kid, who's gonna take the first stage tonight, in the first time in front of you're gonna be able to perform this night in front of
jimmy darling!
i'm not a stage artist like you, mom.
listen to your mother.
you've got a very good smile and a great mood.
you're star quality, jimmy.
now get your ass up on the stage and show your mother why you're so proud of you.
jimmy.
maggie's dead.
you want the details?
elsa's next.
tonight.
looks like... you'll have a chance... in real life now.
jimmy... jimmy... jimmy jimmy jimmy jimmy jimmy
good for you.
how dare you come in unannounced!
what do you want?
you have to go.
they've been planning revenge all day in ethel's trailer.
they're gonna kill you.
why should i believe you, huh?
my monsters love me.
i'm like their mother.
ethel was more like their mother than you.
you killed their real mother.
the last of a desperate man's bullshit.
who's desperate now?
you saw what they did to him.
but where would i go?
anywhere but here.
you could have saved me.
we just did.
there you are.
what's jimmy doing?
he'd be here if he could.
it's time.
give me that.
ethel!
come on, girls, let's get some justice.
oh.
thank you for coming.
i would never deny a woman in a difficult situation.
i'm not in a spot.
but i'm in a hurry.
oh.
i want to report a homicide.
who was murdered?
a young woman.
leave it here.
slowly.
put your hands where we can see them.
i did.
send me to the sting.
what are you doing here?
i came to count.
i'm the new owner here.
where's elsa?
gone.
he went after his dreams.
elsa sold us out again.
$00,000.
nothing.
everything here, including your contracts, belongs to me now.
and i want to see what's mine.
was it always your dream, sir?
to be in show business?
dream.
yeah.
and now it's turning into reality.
thirsty.
go get me a lemonade with a strawberry.
yes, sir.
are you ready?
yeah.
they're perfect.
i want to try it now.
sure.
the other one.
put it on.
thank you.
but jesse james escaped and hid for two years.
in the greatness, the united states army was after sitting in the bulls and crazy horse's armies... to defeat and take the gold of black hills in south dakota.
after the defeat of the battle of little bighorn, the u.s. government has chosen to starve the lakota people out of hunger and submit to submission.
hold the line!
but despite the small battle against the u.s. army, the indian's struggle was getting worse.
lakota leaders sitting bull and crazy horse's options were running low.
you're a man with a strong heart.
but i'm tired.
i'll see you.
in spite of the destruction of the native tribes and their culture and the violence they've seen, they have not given up.
to go there for people who live in those times, it meant taking the opportunity to be rich.
many women and men have tried their luck.
the united states became the first country to save itself from a global depression once the golden economy.
the solution was found in the west.
there's been a lot of cows in texas' mexican border for a long time.
but until the railroad was completed, they couldn't be able to move back to the fucking hungry people in the east.
for 00 bucks a head in texas, the cows were sold for $00 on the east coast.
the cattle barons have been buying a large part of the nurturing field from kansas to california.
this land was making unbelievable opportunities for its owners.
we're talking about millions of acres, farms, thousands and thousands of major animals.
one of the cattle thieves in new mexico was going to turn into one of the men who'd been wiped out by the west's evil.
his story started 0,000 miles east.
billy never knew his father.
in the early 0000s, he and his mother moved to new mexico.
for years he's been wandering aimlessly.
what do you want?
whiskey.
drop the bottle.
there were different kinds of cowboys.
always in the corner.
that's all you had to watch out.
billy used what he did best to make it through.
billy the kid was using a very good weapon.
he spent every dollar he made to get a bullet for practical purposes.
only the strong ones in a place like this would survive.
where are you going?
to lincoln.
i'm just passing through here.
these cattle belong to john tunstall.
then john tunstall can come and get their cattle back.
it'll help you if you let me go.
i don't think so.
i don't think you have a choice.
the young cattle thief, billy the kid, was caught by a farm owner he was trying to steal his cattle.
most people shoot cattle thieves where they see them.
you still haven't told me who you're working for.
i'm not working for anyone.
everyone in lincoln county works for somebody, son.
yeah, but i don't work.
you looked like a man who was used to buying me what you wanted.
you're right.
there's only one problem that i am.
you have many men.
do you have room for one more?
when billy the kid came to lincoln, he needed the job.
john tunstall needed cowboys.
john tunstall came to the west to make a fortune.
he's moved into the town of lincoln, where he can make money.
but he pissed off some very strong men.
lincoln was one of the wildest places in the wild west.
everything from cattle prices, land and government missions was in ev's control.
they're paying for law enforcement.
in fact, most of the people who lived in lincoln thought they were bully.
john tunstall came to town and put his nose in the beef business that's been in the house for a long time.
nobody would have been neutral.
billy, when john got into work with henry tunstall, he became tunstall's man.
in a few months, the young outlaw was the most trusted man in tunstall.
for the first time in his life, he felt like he was in the west house.
tunstall was a mentor to billy the kid.
pass me your plate, billy.
thank you.
i'm starving.
everything's going great, son.
i'm glad you're here.
thank you.
billy was always barely along.
he was seen by many people as a foot team.
it was incredible and life-changing for a young man billy's age.
while billy the kid was a part of the cattle industry that was fueling america's enlarge, a few hundred miles up north, a man was doing everything he could to stop the expansion in the west.
calm down, gentlemen.
i extend my left hand as a friendship suggestion.
if he hadn't done that, most of us wouldn't be here today.
we would have died fighting instead of going to the reservation.
when they put us in the settlement, they actually took the human spirit.
he trusts me.
he's talking to me.
jesus christ.
this policy is known as "the term."
but i think they wanted to make us capable of protecting ourselves.
there was a promise used in the military.
"kill the indian and protect you."
if you destroy the indians' cultures, you'd be a better person.
they thought we were savages.
the proud lakota warrior knew he had to be reassigned for the people of the people.
i'm not happy here."
"i'm not happy here."
"we don't want to live in space."
you're not used to life in the settlement.
give me some time.
i'm sure it will.
after serving his objections to the united states authorities, the military is afraid the lakota warrior has started a new indian footing.
the united states was so afraid of crazy horse.
it was said that crazy horse wanted to kill a general visiting.
the united states authorities were concerned about the rumors of a new uprising.
the fear that crazy horse was planning something, while the lakota warrior went to meet with the authorities to clear his name.
crazy horse thought he was meeting with the authorities in the united states.
he didn't realize the importance of the situation before.
they wanted to put him in a prison cell.
and then he pulled out his knife.
although i think the most trustworthy comment is that the white u.s. sentry kills her by circumcising her.
crazy horse wasn't killed in battlefield.
the vision was right.
unexpectedly overwhelmed by the sentry.
in september 0, 0000, the man who fought his whole life to protect his people and fought against the united states was killed.
it's hard to talk about crazy horse's death, 'cause after all these years, the pain is so fresh.
one of the most fascinating sides of the crazy horse and his legacy is one of the few people in the history of native american leaders in american history, the most uninformed by indians.
today, it is considered a symbol of courageous resistance to the united states government, and it is said of respect for itself.
i think that's what makes him so strong.
by crazy horse's death, the lakota people waited for a leader who could save the rest of their culture desperately.
until he paid home to the catron, his prosperity was his concern.
this is for you.
what if he resists?
i'm not interested in what's gonna happen.
i'm just interested in the result.
copy that.
go check it out.
you stay here.
okay.
what's your hurry, boys?
we heard the shot.
really?
don't do anything stupid, son.
this has nothing to do with you.
that's what it's for.
there are always conflicting interests between these competition businesses.
but like a lot of disagreements in the west, it became personal.
when someone was killed, it was personal.
that was john henry tunstall.
he was killed for a disagreement.
it was a personal matter now.
by john tunstall's death, billy is on his way to find his killers.
this road would lead him from an unrecognizable cowboy to become the legend of the west.
as the country continues to expand, men like billy the kid realize that the border is not governed by law.
but over 000 miles from new mexico, a man was preparing to bring it to the west.
nobody's been tougher than wyatt earp in the orgasms that men get what they want every day for survival.
he was big by the 00th century standards.
he was so excited about his size.
wyatt earp was one of the thousands of americans that raided west in order to be rich.
wyatt was caught in the infirmary western disease.
he always felt he had to push the next border.
this border could be mining, real estate, and anything to bring adventure.
that's how wyatt's life was driving.
he did all the work on the border just to get it.
he's done everything from laying tracks for the pacific railroad to hunt buffalo on the plains, even in the brothel.
to get the cattle out of the cows to the eastern cities, they're supposed to be driving through the railroad hubs that quickly transformed into crowds.
so the quick-blown cities appeared.
a landscape of unintended land was suddenly turning into a hotel 00 rooms.
the young men who managed to come to these cities were drinking whiskey and carrying a gun.
i mean, there were plenty of young men drinking well and armed.
that was one of the reasons the west was wild.
wyatt saw that there's no law in dodge city and disagreements with violence.
he had a hard life.
they'd either go back east or they'd be worse.
but wyatt earp felt there was a lot more in his fate.
he was going to prove to be an important place in dodge city.
you tricked the wrong guy.
that's my money.
this guy's a cheat.
calm down.
he cheated.
calm down.
he cheated.
put the gun down.
did you see his gun?
everybody saw him reach for his gun.
give me that.
i'll shoot you!
come on.
the city of dodge needed a desperate lawman.
wyatt earp was perfect for this job.
it didn't take long for wyatt earp to be a police chief to dodge city.
it wasn't necessary for a special education to be a lawman.
that's not how it works in this town.
wyatt earp wouldn't ask questions.
whipping with a car is a term from him.
wyatt earp became famous shortly in dodge city.
his role as a lawman would become one of the most famous figures of the west.
because cartoon chickens give my dad nightmares.
where were you?
and this was irving berlin's white christmas.
the greatest christmas song ever sells all the time is the world's best-
what?
actually, irving berlin wrote over 0,000 songs.
why don't you marry him?
what's the matter with you?
i'm fine.
you have the type to write.
what does that mean?
what are you doing on this holiday season?
hey, baby.
where are you going?
father melley called.
i have to protect the scene of jesus' birth in the church.
i have to cook something for the food sale.
did you hear me complaining?
what's rhyming with poinsettia?
i forgot again!
you're a hard man!
i can't produce anything in a hostile environment!
if you had two cents of talent, i wouldn't be hostile!
if you kick me again, i'm leaving.
your legs are crooked.
how's it going?
so i brought you some soup and a thick coat.
yeah, i'll call him.
horribly ordinary!
awful!
of course not!
yeah, and you know i'm a jew in eight.
good.
i'm gonna go get a bagel or something.
i'm going to the dinner protection business again.
i'm making a phone call to shanghai garden.
but whatever i decide, it's gonna be good!
i only have three days to make cake!"
that's not his voice, but whatever.
boom!
i was gonna make a cake, but i had to work late.
and i'm done.
so thank you, hungarian bakery!
says who?
larry's wife won't bring it.
he's making a great cake!
you know what he's doing?
any chance you could be in that town?
i really thought you were gonna make the cake!
aren't i profitable?
she'll never be with you, you know why?
because he'll have to take his own arm.
stop it!
great!
i've clearly been naive.
what are you doing?
sounds like you've started.
kitchen robot, big scratches...
let me think.
nice, easy cake recipe.
how about that chocolate cereal?
at least i'm wearing my pants proper shirt-- i'm wearing you...
a monkey could do it.
i love you.
i love you.
am i dreaming we're giants?
no.
you should have put more baking powder on.
you don't even know what a pint is!
and nobody wants to buy this stupid toy cake!
we'll take it to a plate closed for the cake sale.
okay.
my calves have never been this far.
come here!
it doesn't fit?
after all the arrangements... after all the prep until after all
anyway, try this.
it's a divine taste.
no problem.
we're not selling traditional food.
we're doing something more fun.
got it.
great plan!
i didn't count on the cake walk!
i've never seen caramel do that.
it's a sweat-covered chair!
come on, come on.
hey, ling.
i have your mental problem.
well, when i...
elaine?
whatever.
i see him, but he's heavy.
how long has this been going on?
what does that mean?
i think you're in love.
how do i get out of this?
i got myself together.
i'm ready to sing.
i'm looking for my soul tonight.
i know there's a lot more going on in life for me.
thank you for accepting me.
how can i help you?
my wife cindy died two years ago.
we were married three years.
we got hit by a car on our anniversary.
cindy and i wanted to have kids.
for example, that he's dead.
how are you gonna do that?
or did she leave her egg embryo?
no.
did you hear me?
i heard.
to clone your dead wife?
scientists are testing it under their hands, mr. cage.
so i secretly attempted to try cindy.
my sister-in-law heard that and hired a lawyer to stop it.
that's why i need a lawyer.
he's going to court today.
yeah, but, mr. stoller, i'm sure your wife was a great man.
but the cloning idea?
please.
there's nowhere else i can apply.
and your firm's met this lawyer before.
who?
larry paul.
i heard you're doing great.
it was.
how can you have a virtual relationship?
a relationship means communication.
what about "o"?
i know you don't, but if their hands aren't on the stupid rope, she can't control a man.
all you care about is control.
i don't know.
really?
and you came here to talk about my virtual relationship?
i came to borrow something.
but forget it.
ally?
excuse me for a second.
the lawyer on the other side, larry.
yeah?
there's a conflict of interest in me here, isn't there?
you're responsible for the client.
yeah, but... but... yeah,
when you were defending him, you didn't use any inside information?
no, but i...
why wouldn't i?
just for the client.
i've already got my case in vain.
i need something.
larry's weakness is rhythm.
he's talking to me too fast, because he knows i can't understand what's coming to me.
okay.
he's vulnerable when he loses his rhythm.
okay.
you and cindy margolis are in the "life" program.
michelle garris e-mailed me and asked me a way to get into hollywood.
we met in hollywood and...
do it!
i'm not using myself.
we can't deny our passion any more.
you want me, i want you.
let's be honest.
you do my knee, and i'll get my hair handed.
you're breaking my spinal cord.
don't you like denial?
then let's be honest.
i'm going!
i went to los angeles, and i didn't even think of you.
your mind is in jackson.
people accuse me of being superficial.
but when it comes to relationships, i know better than human behavior.
in the last month, you shaved your legs in the morning.
is that your scientific thesis?
it's over if a woman shavers in the morning instead of lying on her legs at night.
no exceptions.
go to jackson.
he's the man you're crazy about.
well, first of all, cloning people, violating society order... against order of order... countermeas
there's never been a court before.
when people were against cloning sheep cloning clones...
this isn't about court.
you're not letting me go to second...
" second" is a sexual term.
i completely object.
i wish i could just get back to the sheep.
these rude have no place in court.
let's get back to square one moment.
right away?
let's hear what mr. paul has to say.
secondly, forgive my jacket...
he's kidding.
even if he can clone, it can't be made by mr. stoller.
too much.
i'm predictable in law cases, but i'm unprepared for too much.
he made fun of me three times.
i demand a written apology, preferably notary.
four times!
is this cloning possible?
first, i want to listen to your client and find out why.
your honor, i hope...
see you tomorrow.
bye.
ling is denying what he wants.
how are you feeling?
he can have it.
he's deep, like a ink bottle.
i mean, i was hoping that ling would drown.
are you really okay?
yeah.
in fact, john cage was the attorney of the opposite side.
did you know?
how'd it go?
smiling is against your principles.
what's going on?
don't ask me.
john wanted a few leads he could use against you in court, so i told him to break your rhythm.
you're no good without rhythm.
cute but useless.
you gave him advice?
his client is practically mine.
we're sleeping together.
you're going behind my back.
you're giving him advice when you can't beat me?
does john know you'll never beat me?
excuse me?
does john know you never beat me?
no, no.
never?
isn't the smile nice?
very cute.
i'm gonna beat you one day, but john's gonna beat you with my advice today.
great.
i'm gonna lose my edge.
no, you won't.
now he knows i'm trying to ruin his rhythm.
he said you'd never beat him.
not just in this case, but in no case.
he did?
yeah.
i bet, john.
he said i'd never beat him?
exactly.
never?
never.
of course.
i could go out with a man in paris.
you can go as far away from here as you like.
i'm not gonna get you into this.
no, i don't.
how was i?
larry?
why are you here?
i thought john and i could walk together.
you're trying to confuse me, i'm not gonna let that happen.
i saw the smirk.
it wasn't supportive.
everything okay, john?
you seem a little uneasy.
he's trying to make it better, but he won't give it to me.
good.
you want to go out to dinner?
i'd love to.
i'm full today, but how about tomorrow?
great.
we always talked about having children.
i think i want to do what cindy and i want to do.
but you're not talking about having cindy's child.
you want to clone him.
the only way to maintain his genetic legacy is cloning.
many people, including mr. paul, who's been sitting there as he is, gayric.
your honor, i'd like to stand up unofficially.
mr. paul, sit down.
mr. cage, don't provoke.
a lot of people find the clone's idea disgusting.
but i'm not a scientist who's trying to make the living species perfect.
and i know i can't bring cindy back.
i want to make sure it takes.
and i don't think i want him extinct.
thank you.
first of all, i'm sorry for your loss.
but you're trying to copy cindy, right?
this is the process of creating a complete genetic replica of your dead wife.
it's the same... conversation... it's the same
cindy, did she ever mention genetically engineered fruit?
he was against it.
what about the genetically engineered chickens?
he was against it.
but it was open to the idea of a genetically engineered copy.
it's not the same thing!
not everything about chickens, counselor.
i didn't say that.
i'm nervous enough without you.
you wouldn't let anyone get your number.
whatever makes you great, you gotta win it again.
maybe melanie scared him off.
john, i'm sorry, man.
but remember, larry said you'd never beat him.
never.
you should think big now.
because this time, i'm not rubbing his feet.
no matter what, you have to find barry white.
yeah.
yeah.
come on!
we did it together, baby.
does ally know?
the pressure doesn't help me.
may i?
of course.
just you and me.
bullshit!
how's that cloning coming along?
very impressive.
we're getting eggs from the transmitters we injected the reproductive.
from the clone candidate, this is cindy stoller, we're taking a cell.
this part is impressive.
the witness said it was impressive before.
just this part?
then we pull the core of each egg with a needle.
there's a lot of needle in cloning.
we're putting the dna removed eggs with the transmitter cell.
in that case, cindy's cell.
and we're applying energy.
what does that mean?
we're traumatizing the heat, a sort of... an electricity... kind of... a...
i'm trying to understand.
you're putting it down to a bug, and i find it disgusting, even for a public supervisor.
let's move on.
you're both falling out of my sight.
what happens to the cells after the power is released?
when the transponder cells are given energy to uninhabited cells, they're bonding with each other.
and then we put them in the surrogate mother, and then there's a cloned baby.
sperm?
no, that's very impressive.
is that really possible?
i must admit, most embryos are dying.
but it's possible one of them is successful.
we've already tried it on sheep.
it's possible for people.
how far is this technology?
present.
people don't expect science.
scientists are waiting.
thank you, doctor.
hey, mark.
if you need anything, your assistant, call mine.
i don't see you anymore, you hypocritical coyote.
i do.
maybe another time.
what's going on?
i'll tell you at dinner sometime.
forget it.
what's the matter with you?
what's wrong with me?
i threw myself at you.
i threw it like a cannon.
you know what a big deal this is for me?
i made you a gesture.
i told you i was in love last week.
anyone can share such a stupid feeling.
please.
i want something very small.
the closing conversations are coming, you should be with me.
together, we can beat larry.
just you and me.
come on!
you're at the end of your career.
what else do you have to do?
you're here?
you're here!
that's why i'm starting to have a cuffed bread.
he was here.
who?
barry white was here.
forgive me for not assuming this.
my concentration.
not like before.
when there are others in the room, i can't get him.
most people can't dance with imaginary giants in front of others.
i always brought her.
i used to walk in crowded streets with him.
no, here's what you need to do.
call him in your bunker, alone.
first take him out without a cut, then go out among the people.
i don't know if i can.
you have to.
without barry, what are you?
look at this.
you can't live like this.
you have no choice but to find barry.
they'll take his personality, his dna.
your brother-in-law loved your brother.
excuse me, i'll make my objections like this.
he's not gonna bring cindy back.
even if the only egg twins share the same dna, different people.
even when i'm getting one's organs, i need his permission.
it's a lot more self-defense, a copy of the dna.
it's their privacy.
sorry.
was it mine?
i didn't mean to press it.
it was a mistake.
don't you want to see your brother's genes continue?
he'll look like him, talk like him.
i wonder if he wouldn't want that.
from the beginning, it was against genetic research.
he certainly wouldn't want that.
never.
you have a computer, too.
i want some privacy.
brazia.
we're actually gonna have our first conversation.
i feel really good for him.
but hurry up.
i'm the one who's gonna rub his stinky feet.
did you find barry white?
any sign of him?
forget it!
you couldn't find your own office?
yours is closer to court and my feet hurt a little.
i have no idea.
elaine!
the events followed each other.
would you stop watching me?
you think that's what i'm doing?
i didn't ignore you.
i thought you weren't interested.
you were right.
'forget it, deja vu'.
you've been furious since i came to this firm.
i'm angry because you lied to me.
i'm angry because i slept with you.
it's hard to wander around happily all the time.
it's hard to be a cheerleader.
i don't understand why you do this every day.
obviously, from the beginning, we're both a little embarrassed.
so why don't we just start over?
you may be right.
you may not.
jackson.
how are you?
no complaints.
it's definitely ours, isn't it?
he's up to something.
yes, it is.
no one, just you and me.
he's a funny little man, isn't he?
it's okay with me.
just in time.
it's like being dr. frankenstein.
the idea of starting organs?
choose dna?
these are terrible.
we could have hockey teams full of wayne gretzky copies.
with a pitbull, they can unite mike tyson.
possibilities.
horror.
but the truth is, every time the science has just stepped up, worries that humanity will come.
we've already made babies, your honor.
we're playing with the genes.
this technology will save lives.
any risk of abuse?
of course, i do.
my client knows his wishes and dreams.
dreams they have together.
this will give you the chance to carry on the family legacy they hope for.
we have to be open to science that makes a couple have children.
it's not about who owns her dna, is it?
i remind mr. paul that his wife, the organs of his dead wife, may not be allowed.
mr. paul, i'm just saying that in case he might say the wrong things about mrs. stoller's wishes.
but there's no reason for us to believe that.
you can't be sure when you can talk.
now it's your turn.
i may not have a legal reason.
but i have a moral compass.
that's what's at stake.
so, why stop there?
he can clone his mother.
his grandfather.
one day, the children can play with their grandmother's twin in the sandbox.
celebrities can start selling their dna.
imagine being a parent to barry white's twin brother.
once you've got the location of the technology, will the line be crossed?
once, we were afraid of heart transplants.
the tube baby idea was considered abnormal.
now the truth of life and the community accepts it.
cloning the organs, saving lives, taking steps to destroy the disease.
these could be real.
but cloning a human being cloned to copy his dna and do a medical match?
dismissed.
sorry.
i appreciate your effort.
i don't want a rematch.
hi.
hi.
do you come here often?
that's my opening line.
it's a lousy line of entry.
has it ever worked before?
better.
do you want to go to the bar?
not tonight.
because you beat larry?
not that.
to tell you the truth, i didn't want to win this time.
no, i want to be alone tonight.
alone with him.
not at all.
like you said, most people don't dance with a imaginary disco giant.
you're not crazy.
actually, i'm a little jealous.
when you're disappointed in the real world, you create something.
hey.
maybe the three of us can walk.
give me a chance.
if he doesn't come, i'm still here.
well, i'll do it.
let's go.
who knew karaoke night would be the most entertaining party on the boulevard?
you said it with p. diddy and kissinger?
i say, "islands in the stream" has never been said that.
the limo driver called and said...
embarrassed donald trump's wedding to the multimillionaire?
sam, i've been in vegas for 00 minutes, but i haven't played a hand of blackjack yet.
your favorite table is ready.
ladies love a good karaoke singer, danny.
call me.
you think you can get any girl you want?
pick it up.
it's a lonely mission, man.
he's here for the new virgin born convention.
girls who aren't technically a virgin can change pure.
the card counters have hit two weeds this month, and the last shift report says there's a lot of losses on the blakjack tables.
there's a card downstairs.
ed thinks he might be a card maker.
maybe we can have this conversation later, like drinking.
patty, it's three, and you've been here a week.
i didn't pay my rent, and the reason that i was allowed to stay my landlord... is to let me stay
listen, i'm sorry, but this is a business.
if we pay for every shirt you screw, i'll sink.
all right, the gift boxes are packed and waiting to go to the guest rooms.
our florist brought the orchids and the rest of them are coming tomorrow.
however, if he doesn't come for a reason, a ship from amsterdam... for my future tulips...
mary, don't worry.
i'm sure everything will be fine.
you're the easiest bride i've ever seen.
thank you for coming, galina.
that looks like a hundred grand.
a hundred grand?
like i said, first for me.
it's a lot more than what we lost.
it's not like playing with a certain duck.
the numbers sit on a table and play if they're rich, right?
the unsub, the red-haired, yellow dress, headed west.
thank you.
mr. sperreos, i'm from security.
the question i always ask.
we're not married yet, and you've been staying out all night.
it's not a sign.
honey, i win here.
the night's over, and so is yours.
all right.
i told donald trump that our wedding must be like a delicious chicken wing compared to the party at palm beach.
my team has been trying to build your wedding to the biggest and most elegant wedding this town has seen in months.
come on.
he was always like a boss when he was a secretary.
why are you so desperate romantic?
when your commission stops playing, the montecito will still be ahead, and that's all i care about.
let's go, guys.
the guy with the tie said he told us that the air conditioning would be a dozen times.
he can mark 00's floors and realize the game is rich.
he's sitting on that slot machine all night, he rarely plays.
and he doesn't keep his eyes on the blakjack tables.
sperreos is happy to get up and win a game a minute before he's in a game.
you can't prove it.
even if i count the cards, it's not illegal.
that's technically correct.
but we have a different kind of justice in vegas.
like before, i can catch a cheat and destroy him in the desert.
i'll be honest with you, i'm an old-fashioned man.
please.
you're in the black book now that we have a picture of you.
if you step inside the montecito, i'll have you arrested in private.
you hear that?
hey, jack!
he's turned us down to 000,000.
as long as there's no machine in the account, you know it's not illegal, and he didn't have it.
at least we can have some fun with him.
it's not your story.
if someone is financing and teaching them something, it's not the end of anything.
mike from last night, from mystique.
the guy who's not from phoenix.
there are other cities you're not.
des moines, for example.
it's amazing, but i gotta go.
i'm devastating, aren't i?
you finally said something that i'm in.
i think you should have the problem because i'm usually attractive.
then what?
maybe i'm a little nervous around you because you're so pretty.
my tongue is being held.
you know what we're gonna do?
what?
we're gonna try and figure out why there's no reason for a drink.
patty.
almost there.
they said i was okay?
it doesn't matter if you're okay or not.
i have to fire you.
please.
thank you, thank you, thank you.
the tailor said he sent it back this morning, but there's no record of him being there.
our 000 friends are coming to this wedding tomorrow, head of state, industries, oprah.
do you want to tell oprah that the wedding was canceled and that he came to las vegas for nothing?
if we don't, the montecito will be happy to get the same thing.
that dress was a masterpiece of fashion.
a dozen french tailor sewed it with a hand suckerchief.
there's no other one like him.
you know how much that dress cost me?
that's a big problem, sam?
wait.
hey, danny, you asked me to check out the big blackjack winners.
the montecito already spent millions on food, flowers, decor, fun.
if the wedding doesn't work as planned, and lipworth refuses to give.
do you really think someone stole it?
what's that thing worth on the street?
why not the tailor galzi?
he was interested when he heard the price of the dress.
mike.
hey.
let me know how it went.
are these the same techniques that sperreos and his team used?
we catch a team, they send someone else in a couple of hours.
if we don't find out what's behind this, we may have to give them the key to the safe.
you'd better get the fuck out of here, you bastard.
you're talking to sperreos?
you'd better get your hands on me, 'cause the president assaults me would cause more than i've won from the montecito to blackjack.
that was good.
did i get the dress?
i just want to know what happened.
i'll make the changes, and i'll give the dress to the montecito messenger.
there's a camera in the store?
i've seen real diamonds in a costume for elton john.
compared to this, this dress is nothing.
galina protects herself.
you're free to go.
i'm helping, patty.
god knows why i accepted this project?
i've always helped the baby bird, even if it was rabies.
then i'll get my tray.
this is christina, one of our best waitresses.
knees bent, back to the back.
above all, trust.
trust.
the tray is full of martinis with its weight.
it's the hardest drink to move.
he doesn't even look at the glasses.
he believes in his ability to do the right thing, and here he is.
black team.
you're not so black.
breathe with me, patty.
be like a booze, patty.
you want me to sit here until mystique opens?
thank god i don't want you standing here like a karate boy.
call me sensei.
vic, this morning, you sent one of your guys to the store to get a dress.
yeah.
remember who you sent?
the tailor gave me a record, but i couldn't remember the face.
bart, you went to the store this morning to buy a dress.
no, i didn't.
why not?
joey stopped me when i was coming out, and he wanted to go.
scan for joey's face and get his address for me.
thank you.
sorry.
the sea of hazar.
why would he spoil his receipts?
did you hear from the dress?
yes, candy.
who's candy?
not me, 'cause i know it's forbidden here, but the others do.
do you know where we can find it?
danny mccoy, montecito surveillance and security.
how do you know nick sperreos?
cops don't scare me.
okay, wait, wait.
fine, fine.
that's enough.
okay, i know him.
he came here a couple of times with his friends.
these are his friends?
you know these guys?
yeah, i guess so.
nick's a good kid.
he also asked me to break the chips.
i guess he thought i wouldn't doubt it.
strippers are always rewarded with receipts.
look, it was good for five minutes work, and i didn't have to take my clothes off.
why are you so interested?
because sperreos and his friends are involved in some kind of card counting operation.
i thought they were just some rich kids.
there's someone behind this, and i need to find out who.
do you have any idea who's training these and financing them?
they came once with a big one.
yeah, they called him bucky.
mitch, did you scan joey's face?
go forward.
someone's paying him.
can you expand the picture?
no, but i can get another angle.
so, lippworth's fiance is lissy?
we need to talk.
but you already know, don't you?
i know you paid to get out of the dress.
what i don't understand is why?
it's the wedding, the details, the cost, the cost... the cost, the cost,
listen.
it's kind of weird if you want to leave.
that's the point.
i don't know if i want to leave.
i love her, but her life... her... her life...
i mean, how many are my friends?
people say it's a cinderella story.
i'm not cinderella.
i'm just a normal girl from new jersey.
i may not know too much, but considering my wedding was 00 times more expensive than my parents' house, my family's house...
that's not true.
it is.
jared and i are so different.
i mean, what's the harm in that?
how old do you think these kids are?
00, no bigger than 00.
danny, it's the yearbook you want.
we'll see.
they're all in their 00s, and they all have the math skills to count the cards.
then they must have been taken from the mathematics department and trained children.
and then i remembered, how can i bring them to knees?
considering how the second team got here, i started in local colleges.
because you're a great guy, and i'm interested in the less attractive ones.
maybe it's time for a change.
listen, mike, before we go this way, there's something i have to say.
i've come to vegas for "the caretaker kogr".
renewal.
i've made mistakes with men in my past, so i wanted to start a clean slate, and i made a vow of forgiveness until i got married.
i mean, just because i gave my present before, doesn't make it any less valuable.
the marrying officer's fine.
good.
what's up?
do you want to go back to school?
i want to go back and do an anthropology degree and go to the rainforest and examine local people.
you're an idiot.
what's up, ruben?
if you touch me, i'll call my lawyer right away.
you're gonna call your lawyer?
what do you want?
where's bucky?
i don't know what you're talking about.
we have records of him robbing the montecito.
i don't think the students here like that kind of thing.
i can call the dean right now and get your ass out of here.
please, don't tell my family.
hey.
hey.
did you ever hear of being reborn a virgin?
so you always knew that?
i'm sorry, but i could get every girl i wanted to get that shit was becoming unbearable.
yes, i set a trap with a very sweet, beautiful person.
you were gonna quit because he wouldn't sleep with you.
hey, where are you going?
hey, mike.
i won't be needing you.
hey.
i was acting like an idiot.
i needed some time to process this whole process.
do you think there's a place in your heart that can give me a second chance?
is it the room service that brings cream, baby?
excuse me.
what were the precious gift events?
because it's my view that the after-year-old dismemberment papers are flipping around.
look, i've been reborn five or six times.
why am i not him?
i tried to change.
so this is my fault?
i'm really sorry.
i took your advice.
i talked to jared and told him everything.
the wedding cancel.
i said the wedding's off, not the marriage.
is bucky training his team here?
hey, ruben, if it's funny, you should know your parents on the phone.
bucky.
mr. buckner?
you know him?
my high school math teacher.
i'm head of security at the montecito.
yeah.
remember miss buckner?
last year, coach escaped with kajoyan.
alimony is killing me.
he owes it at night school.
but the tax evasion is.
you guys have made a lot of money from a lot of casinos.
i'm guessing some of that money wasn't reported to the irs.
keep these card numbers off the montecito, and we'll forget what happened.
before these kids get out, danny's gonna take pictures and information.
what's the name of the food on the left?
oh, my god.
did you miss the flowers, the caviar and oprah?
you know i don't care about those things.
the only thing that matters is spending the rest of my skate with you.
delinda, i'm sorry.
she has to listen to you, honey.
i'm gonna make you a star.
i hope you put a note somewhere.
careful, we're almost there.
do i know you?
vinny's hanging out with your mom.
do you really want to risk your life for a skirt and a geezer?
any sign of the professor?
i speak six languages, why...
stein's gonna kill sara in the library.
he's in a speedster disguise of stein, and he's pulling over the ship.
since when do you call him jax?
unfortunately, the effect won't last long.
what did you do to stein?
capone's men are taking over the ship.
you're here because i killed jsa's stupid leader.
mr. rex tyler, right?
i don't want to spend all night here.
you're welcome, you drunken lunatic.
my job is better.
i'm the authority of the entire arena.
every night, 00,000 people come here to have fun, and i'm sure they're having fun.
are you a player?
yeah.
okay.
tell springsteen i'm the boss of this place.
don't say that.
anything she wants, just say it.
have you seen a hot marketing director around here?
where have you been, man?
i have a meeting after the game.
how much time do we have?
0 minutes, 00 seconds.
five minutes, i can do a lot of things in 00 seconds.
you're a funny girl.
i'm seeing other people.
i'm seeing other people.
happy birthday, ben.
how do you know?
good morning.
all right.
happy birthday, ben.
you're a maintenance man, aren't you?
two years ago, you said no matter what you say, "yes."
it's a little tricky because you don't always ask yes or no questions.
forget i said that for now.
there's gonna be a circus here tonight, and if there's ice on the floor, those fire-breathing guys are gonna fall on their own fires.
understand?
you also told me not to run in the hallway.
forget about the conversation we had two years ago.
oh, no, no, no.
he wants to talk.
that's not good, dude.
melt the ice, bobert.
benjamin!
come here.
quick.
crystal, before you get upset and start kicking everybody off, about this ice...
have you seen a little white pill that says spanish on it?
i don't understand your degree of attention.
or have i already taken that pill?
hello.
yeah, i think you've already taken the pill.
i hate it when the circus gets here.
are they happy?
are they sad?
why are his pockets so big?
i'm sure you're talking about clowns.
good morning, beautiful people.
good morning, alonzo.
you're in an amazing mood again.
every day is a good day, man.
really, every day?
ben, that was the best day ever.
the day i stopped taking care of myself, and started to devote myself to the great people of san diego.
what are you doing?
i gotta get that pill out of my system.
what happened to the charity event today?
i invested a lot of money on unlawful himalaya dog racing.
one of the dogs allegedly bit one of the himalai.
anyway, i have a himalaya nightmare.
can't we use that money to make it better?
well, you're the owner here, we'll do what you say.
have you seen the oil painting?
don't forget to bring some kind of boy for a photo.
you know, black, white.
get me an asian kid.
and we're gonna need a mug.
the asian kid will give me a trophy.
you're right to clap, because these are very good ideas.
benjamin, i almost forgot.
your... son?
how's your new assistant working out?
thanks for that.
he set a man on fire?
there was an investigation.
the evidence was inadequate.
well, yeah.
he's good, isn't he?
she set him on fire.
not very well.
a-a-al-al...
alonzo... alonzo... alon
what do you think it means when a girl sends a message, "we need to talk"?
i'm in something similar.
i think you'll find a better chance of getting closer.
what could be better than that?
yeah, that's what i thought.
happy birthday, little man.
good morning, heather.
good morning.
i'll tell you why i love it.
ben!
there's a man in his office, and he's very attractive.
okay.
hi.
hi.
is there anyone else here besides you, someone a little more attractive than you?
no.
okay.
me.
i'm roman.
so you're crystal's son.
this must be awful for you.
yeah.
it's not fantastic.
i wonder how they swam in the water.
okay.
i like mafia movies.
as a gift... talent as a talent... as
this place is exciting.
there's political meetings, sports, rodeo, night football, motor racing.
don't you care about any of this?
remember me?
i texted you three, and you didn't answer any of them.
i think after five months of sleeping together, you'd have to know that the unanswered messages are driving me crazy.
look, i know we hate commitment.
i'll take this dating thing.
but this morning, i woke up at your place alone, which means you snuck out of the house.
when i was paying for the coffee, i couldn't find my underwear until i came out of my wallet.
i got another cup of coffee with this, more...
who's that?
and i like mafia movies.
and you, i really need to talk.
yes, it is, because this is the chance to get closer.
what could be better than that?
this is a good business opportunity for you.
see you at christmas party.
you didn't mean that.
speak spanish.
i know a little spanish.
yeah, i never understood what you said.
actually, your english is fine.
elephant!
crystal.
did you hear what i just said?
i didn't.
let me see this talk.
i don't think you should say, "yay, black kids!"
well, when do i say?
i don't think you should ever.
and i wouldn't sing the song.
there's still ice.
yeah, i know.
it doesn't seem too sad to me.
it's your life form.
you never wanted someone who was emotionally loyal to you, wondering how and where you are, kissing you in the morning, waiting for you at home at night.
what's so good about celebrating all this on your birthday?
but you're throwing big parties on your own birthday.
i need to know i'm never alone.
i'm not sure what i should do now.
i'll go down, you step on the gas, go.
thank you.
negroes, whites, asian and--
don't sing that song.
i think we should go to dinner to celebrate my birthday.
that would be a good step for our relationship.
i think we should be together.
i'm in the way of finishing this relationship.
why did you let me talk first?
you first.
you first in all of our conversations.
remember when we said we were seeing other people?
alonzo?
he's my best friend.
he's been wanting to live with me for a while.
he wants to get attached.
he wants to get attached?
it's a man we're talking about, isn't it?
what a man.
look, i...
alonzo is an adult.
he cares about other people.
he asks questions about me, and he's listening to my answers.
what bothers me is that i thought we were the same.
when you said you were emotionally damaged, you...
how did he react when you told him?
he was already a very happy man.
it blew him up in the air.
live with me.
we can do the commitment thing.
honey, i'm not the right woman for you.
you're sweet, you're great to have fun.
but no one can be right for you, because you only think of yourself.
what the hell was that?
i think the voice was coming through my head.
i can't be a frying master.
i guess so.
you know what's the worst thing?
i don't think about anyone but myself.
it's really impossible for me to take care of other people.
suddenly, i feel the need to connect, but i have no idea how to do this.
i'm in trouble, man.
kermit the frog, right?
yeah.
what about him?
i think it's a great song.
go, man.
sunshine.
hey, ben.
hi.
he's a very attractive man.
sorry.
does anyone know how to use a axe?
come on, clowns.
almost done.
keep breaking.
good day.
where's the asian kid?
i specifically requested an asian kid.
there's an asian kid over there.
alonzo.
yeah.
yeah.
thank you.
they've stopped.
most people ask me why i love children so much.
maybe it's because i never had my own child.
i believe that our children's happiness is what we'd like to live in, and it's made by the people that live in this society.
they're our future, and their prosperity is our most important cause.
when you want them to do something for you, they do it with enthusiasm.
or as i got older, i started to believe that the life you live for yourself is empty.
i wasn't gonna tell you, but i'm gonna have to share a little song that i wrote in this particular situation with you.
aside from the musical part, it was really touching.
sometimes it's really fun working with you.
i'm incredibly happy right now.
on three, everyone say, "thank you, crystal cohen."
two... two... two... two... two...
oh, my god!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
what a wonderful moment.
i noticed you left a little early.
hello again.
are you okay?
i'm a little scared.
sure.
you know, it's really normal that you think you're picking the right guy.
i'm 000% sure i picked the right guy.
all right.
what a wonderful moment.
i've never done this before.
what if i'm not ready?
what if he's just acting like that because he wants me?
after having me, what if he doesn't want me anymore?
of course she'll want you.
you have everything.
everything.
okay?
okay.
okay.
in fact, we can make love one last time.
hey, crystal.
i really want to make love to her.
i'll see what i can do.
can you give your attention to that poor kid you're throwing in the air?
fortunately, i convinced them to publish this photo.
more than a cop kick.
less than sinking the mayor's ship.
great.
great.
while i've got you,...
i want you to sit down with someone who's gonna be incredibly useful in the sunlight center for us, with child juvenile joy and loyalty.
get in the car.
get in the car.
i'm sure you have a lot to talk about.
great.
happy birthday, ben.
thank you.
look.
what's your name?
dan.
thank you, dan.
i forgot.
have you seen alice?
in his office.
it was business.
i...
i know what you mean.
what do you do in a situation like this?
i think i'm gonna run like my life's connected to this.
yeah, that's what i'm gonna do.
they've set up security cameras looking directly at paddy.
melts in your mouth when you eat.
he's rebelled against everything you say.
this is bullshit friend.
these guys finally realized by living with me, that the dee that was too cool and so funny.
dee, you're undercover, okay?
dee, we're putting you in charge of this mission, but is it all about arrogance and question?
maybe we can go to the private office upstairs.
do i have to know the man who spaghetti's on his face?
and i'm gonna buy one for the guy i don't know.
i said why.
'cause i think you've had a really long time last time.
i didn't, 'cause charlie left it in half with fucking emergency lunch.
i don't want to be hit by something you've come across.
as i told that a few minutes ago, our fish today are exhausted.
instead, let's all get a plate of hot pipe spaghetti.
extra sauce.
i've always wanted to see this.
comedians, baseball players, even protestors.
god bless the cream pie and america.
look, i'm an experienced businessman with a long history of asian countries.
imagine the recipe for my excellent cream pie with your low-priced labor force.
because of all my accidents, the factory was shut down for a few days.
as a matter of fact, we're quite familiar with the chinese factory.
i don't think there's any need to worry about the good situation.
just old pornography knowledge.
all aboard the tucker train.
it looks as if it's not in the shape of it.
no, no.
these are the items my children value when they were little.
besides, you know when you can't sell these disgusting things in the garage.
these boxes show how great our lives are.
like they always fake id on you?
the pictures i made at the kindergarten and the turkey on thanksgiving?
i'm sorry, honey.
i'll put the finger in here, 'cause i have a feeling something's changed here.
it's not just danny who's wearing a jersey and hit a bat.
they were in the basement with the christmas lights, and i noticed miss bart lost his shiva.
i just didn't see you have a plan to win.
yeah, you gave us a free beer and then you said, "vote for me."
we're so lucky that everyone's backed up.
i really don't do anything about sports anymore.
god, it feels like it's just another life.
i gotta hit something with a stick for beer.
okay, brawlers, i'd like to propose a toast before the game.
maybe we'll remember that winning isn't everything, but we have a barrel!
wait.
everyone, this is riley and my daughter emma.
so, wheeler's a 0-0 lead with unplanned pregnancy.
tuck, why don't you give something to the newcomers?
ben!
this is something i know.
are you going out with mom?
i was gonna talk to myself, but bonnie said she'd handle it.
i did, but i didn't tell him.
you can't say you took it well.
i mean, when your mom's on a date with coach, they can have a pillow talk in bed.
if i had to call the girl that you did happy hours ago, we'd be happy to have your voice cut off.
we could have more babies.
i'm going to practice until my brain is exhausted.
he throws his food around, i think he's doing it nice.
her father's daughter.
mom's coming soon, will you take the equipment downstairs to the beach for me?
that's more than my heavy-duty earlier weight.
you don't care about the cups on the shelf, do you?
sounds like i missed the game.
you missed one little thing.
the children voted riley to be captain.
i was just saying it was definitely lost.
i was feeding my baby and you took my team away.
i was wearing your glove... and then everyone started yelling.
"you're unbelievable!"
because i hear it's incredible.
maybe if you come to my place, you'll do good things i haven't done in a long time.
because i don't care what others say.
"i'm so excited, you suckers!"
we just ate some italian food.
that's why i'm trying to stop you.
honey, i don't think we should be talking about these parts, this is about my personal life.
okay, honey, i know you don't want to hear this, but i'm a woman, and i need it.
when i won't even open my mouth.
"to wear the hook."
i don't want anyone to cancel their plans.
thank you, danny.
not yet, but it will be solved.
honey, are you okay?
i tried to get here as soon as i could.
with my hair and this, you're 00 minutes away.
i couldn't call anyone who could look after emma.
the dentist said i should see you right away.
and remember, don't bring home a giant toothbrush.
for the bathroom key.
i'm sorry about your date with hank.
i don't even have to talk to you right now.
please tell me emma's in the car outside the park.
hank canceled something or i don't know the details.
but if mom asks, they hid me here.
you care about other people's happiness.
to make sure he doesn't see and not understand.
dude, you need to come back.
you think she stopped being a rigantor?
i'm gonna let the little planets whisper in my head?
will you look here?
the minister has gone home.
if hank doesn't work, he's like somebody else.
do you have a menu down here?
mom, i'm home.
what are you doing here?
i'm sure it's my robe.
hank, you ready for round two?
danny, there's nothing going on here.
you're unbelievable.
yeah, he hates it.
because we're not watching the same game here.
it's actually full of vodka.
we'll drink it and we'll throw it away.
we have a chance to do a clean shot.
sit down, wheeler to the other ladies.
what about riley?
okay, tuck, your turn.
hit it again and don't come out of the field.
when i told riley something he shouldn't have heard before, he ate my crayons.
i can't forget you're still eating brown.
don't worry, i'll watch your back, okay?
hey, teammates.
don't you think she looks cute today?
is that my phone?
something about the game.
thank god.
i was worried i couldn't bring you back.
i know what you're thinking, but you gotta do something other than control the team.
like i'm doing now?
i want you to be more serious in games.
you know, i find it harder to put you in the squad than the others.
to tell you the truth, i have to get you off the team.
but i can't.
i'm really gonna miss you when i don't play you.
thank you.
what did you want to tell me?
just... just... just... just...
"take, riley's gone.
"i'm firing him right now."
what's that?
that's the bad version of what i just told you.
coach, can we talk?
i think you want your robe back.
it didn't... it didn't
mom told me what happened.
i'm really sorry about that reaction.
i'll say i'll be better next time.
i don't think it's gonna happen next.
don't blame him for being a bum.
so you're keeping a funny woman out of your league?
no, that's my mom you're talking about.
and someone who goes out with him is very lucky.
i'll go out with him.
it'll be safe if you take it down.
what's wrong with me?
maybe you're just so smart and so beautiful.
winning is fun for you.
oh, my god, i like this!
but what does that make me?
the room's full of mugs and nobody's sharing it with me?
looks like danny figured it out.
yeah, none of us can be like your brother.
yeah, i think i've heard it a couple or a thousand times.
right.
right.
i was thinking of a change for the win.
i've never tried it before.
yeah, i think you should figure out how to get the real brawlers out without me.
ben, nobody wants me.
go brawlers!
all thanks to my lovely assistant captain.
if it wasn't for the riley ref.
she really needed a new cup.
no, i can't hide anymore.
honey, you gotta help me.
the fear in their eyes caused them to close.
get lost.
don't worry.
i'll find a man who can make you happy.
okay.
looks like he's going to be better.
i know when i see my son at work.
as i always say, thank god for giving me ben.
do the wheeler, do the wheeler...
what's riley doing?
they call him wheeler.
we'll use you to watch it from the inside.
why is patty interested in this murder?
i suggest he doesn't answer any more questions to mr. purcell.
you were in your house alone with your wife's body.
no sign of forced entry into the house.
patty, i saw the man who did this.
our company was hired to do toxicological research on a chemical compound.
these companies are worth hundreds of billion dollars.
michael, this is daniel purcell.
we have a protection problem.
he's the chief advisor of the world's third largest energy producer.
did you tell anyone about us?
the acid rain from the coal-burning plantation makes the bullet levels 00 times above the national average.
the residents tried to sue a mass.
so there's over 000 cases filed against them in the last three years?
why didn't he bribe you?
i wonder the same thing, but i don't know how patty knew we were setting up tom.
what have you guys got on purcell?
we need to make sure our secret isn't exposed, so we can move forward.
it's okay with me.
ellen, i know it's disappointing, but you have to back off.
we'll all pull back.
it might help me.
i have no experience in criminal law.
we must have chased him before he could find time to steal something.
it was dark the first time.
you know, last night, i was wondering if somebody stir up houses.
it's your job to find out, isn't it, detective?
let's see if there's anything in the photos that can refresh your memory.
mr. purcell didn't come here to be harassed.
he always did.
this is a very important development, mr. purcell.
if you find the ring, you'll find my wife's killer.
mr. purcell, i believe you.
because the person who killed christine is still out there, and you've certainly been of no use to it.
you can't use these against me.
don't answer that.
i swear you're acting like you want to be arrested.
the only event that happened three years ago is not possible.
no, but it's like he's lying about everything.
i mean, it's been entering his house twice and nothing was stolen.
wasn't the contaminant hurt health?
we talked on the phone a couple of times, but i guess she's still unacceptable.
he wants to introduce me to the man he's with.
if there's something we need to know, patty will tell us when he's ready.
whatever you've got the company involved, it's better if nothing else comes out of stolen documents.
if you're wondering what happened to christine purcell, look at the grieving widow.
my only job is to protect mr. kendrick, and if you've done anything to expose him or you, or ultima national resources horns... if you've ever done anything... to expose him or ultima or ultima national
everything okay in new york?
daniel purcell, i'm meeting patty hewes.
do you have any reason to believe that ultima national resources was involved in the murder of your wife?
i've watched many farm animals die these days.
00 years ago, he used daniel purcell as an expert witness, and he won a case.
then why was ibc global's report suggesting 000 partsm was acceptable?
daniel purcell was a brilliant man, but when he faced patty, he collapsed.
no, it's just another big conspiracy to expose for you.
as soon as i tell you what i know about ultima national, you put me aside.
whatever he tells you, you can't trust him.
i don't know who killed your wife, but you'll be blamed for it.
and that purcell worked together before ibc global.
michael was born nine months after purcell's testimony.
just the two of them.
we'll face the unexpected elements.
with a big attack, we'll disable them.
on three.
one, two, three.
shoot them!
detective stark?
excuse me.
yeah.
that guy over there.
and did you pull him over on the 00th?
am i under oath?
i'd appreciate it if you'd stop asking that now.
was it mr young who you pulled over on the 00th?
i don't know if you don't say it again.
what?
do you know what this is, you son of a bitch?
it wasn't a real bomb.
"no blood, no crime"
not legally, detective.
even a bomb threat is a clear physical threat.
terrible buildup.
i think your shirt is horrible.
your honor, we demand the dismissal of the case.
liz, i don't know what to say.
he's your partner, jack.
it's not enough, jack.
we've been trying to catch wayne young for years.
liz, i...
jack, what are you gonna say?
i need to be alone.
you want some chips?
no, i don't want any chips, dan.
i think they put a spice in it.
it feels better.
you ruined the case, dan... you ruined the case...
but it's a state case.
you mean your ex-boyfriend's case?
they're finishing the investigation.
that means no more department income.
department income?
and you would fight crime with sticks?
we need financial resources for a research.
you know what?
good luck to you.
you'll see.
good day to all of you.
see you in hell.
here it is.
i thought you might remember that.
you're absolutely right.
hey, do you have any nicotine gum with you?
i can't imagine myself without them.
because i left those cancer sticks.
that's it.
all right, we gotta do some errands.
first, i gotta get myself a shotgun.
you misunderstood!
there's a misunderstanding!
please!
i made a deal when you were in jail.
for both of us.
what kind of deal?
heroin.
near south america.
i put it in one of our trucks.
i have a client.
and that's just the beginning.
if he does, we'll bring more heroin.
wayne, we're so close!
you meet the man, we make delivery.
what about the cops?
they can't follow you after you across the border!
cops can't do anything!
rough day?
yeah.
is it a girl or a job?
you're gonna need a second donut.
hey, dan.
what's up?
of course.
i'll tell liz about it in the morning.
i'll call you back.
freeze!
okay.
okay.
freeze!
i'm not moving!
why are you attacking me?
you're hurting the sacred bond.
i've got three warrants on me.
it's not the first thing to do with the cops.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
how would you feel if the warrant was removed?
when you say "no resentment"...
"julius, you don't have to go to jail."
because that's how it seemed to me.
i'm all yours, man.
you can do whatever you want.
i want to know about wayne young.
i know that.
i know wayne young.
as you wish?
all i want is a piece of paper, pen and writing... and a piece of paper, and a piece of paper,
do it.
he has a place in oakwood, okay?
that's it.
does that make us good?
we're gonna put him in prison...
good.
okay.
because i want to hug you.
you can hug me.
all right.
thank you so much, man.
okay.
okay.
what can i do for you, jack?
i was talking to dan... and i was talking to dan
so it's all happening by the book... it's all about... everything that
not really your partner's style.
actually, i could send her home.
don't worry about it.
just let me know how to fight wayne.
okay.
i'll see you at the office at 0:00.
wayne works in a garage in east dallas.
he works for a company like shell.
but what are we gonna arrest him for?
we'll think of something when we get there.
no, dan.
we'll do "an investigation."
yeah, that'll work.
by the way... by the way... by
how did you know where wayne was working?
am i still under oath?
this is the address.
hello!
very strange.
what did you say about coming in and looking at the truck?
and this?
we're gonna have to disapprove of or not?
they should know security sucks.
besides, nobody gets in here without a helmet.
you mean us?
hey, ours is a breach.
well, it's okay if you don't spend more than $0.00,
so i'm fine with that.
it's like a woman... like a law
it makes you angry, but it doesn't do anything to calm you down.
everything gets worse.
what the hell is this place?
what are they doing here?
we don't know... we don't know
i have to call liz.
just... just... just... just...
dan, what are you doing?
dan, we can't be here.
what you did was illegal, dan?
okay?
this truck is full of boxes.
yeah.
blameless boxes.
come on.
we're over a 00-foot thing.
i can feel the whining in my back!
another excuse for the report.
listen, dan.
we got off on a bad start here, okay?
did you hear anything?
start the car.
i'll close the back.
dan, this is an illegal investigation, okay?
if we get caught, we're in big trouble!
your phone's ringing.
god!
i hate it.
hello.
hi, detective dan.
i'm julius, man.
how's our parole deal going?
hey, i can't talk now.
i'm behind wayne young's truck.
long story.
there's a big man with a big gun... a big
caesar's right to caesar, paco.
looks like things are going well.
you're glad you didn't blow my head off with a shotgun, aren't you?
it was just a little misunderstanding, wasn't it?
yeah.
let's make some money.
yeah, me too.
shit!
what the hell is that?
thanks for coming.
i'm dying slowly.
you look good.
not good.
you know my parole.
the cop i made the deal was trapped in one of wayne young's trucks.
there's no trucks in there!
i mean, i have a girlfriend in jamaica.
maybe we'll come back here and open a motel.
but why am i here?
you're gonna introduce me to wayne young.
you guys are friends, he's... he's... he's...
that's a very deep word.
we're more like colleagues, man.
sometimes she'd want me to take weed to the north, that's all.
skeeter, dear...
you gotta find this truck, and you gotta find it, man.
look, i'll give you $000.
he's a monster, man!
he cut off a man's thumb in time!
the same fingers looked lost!
that's disgusting, dude!
i love this car.
including the sound system?
and the hubcaps?
you can have them, too.
you can have the ashtray, skeeter.
just find the truck for me, okay?
all right, i'll help you find the truck.
i didn't mean to yell at you.
that's the joke.
they're not gonna examine the entire shipment.
what the hell was that?
don't panic.
dan, this is texas, okay?
you just described 00,000 square miles of land.
god damn!
then let's break the door so we can jump out.
what's wrong?
physics, dan.
it's suicide.
not if you jump fast enough, man.
we're gonna drop the truck at zero.
come on.
why are you acting like such a bad thing?
we found wayne young right where we wanted him.
yeah.
it's a two-block highway in a country.
exactly.
i'm detective jack bailey.
please leave a message and i'll call you back.
well, it's been 00 minutes.
congratulations.
you're officially going the same way with your partner.
still waiting for your girl?
detective bailey's not my girlfriend.
jack.
wherever you are, i hope you're having fun.
all i know is they're somewhere in the south.
how are you?
thank you very much.
man, what took you so long?
dude, you asked me to find a criminal, didn't you?
can we just focus, please?
where's the truck with the police?
that way.
so i'm just going this way?
what happens on that way?
i'm working on the pipes.
dude, you... dude... dude
i think he had a deal with a man.
dude, you're gonna kill me.
you're definitely gonna kill me.
you know anything else?
i heard he had a scary look.
and he's not from this country.
we can make the deal on thursday.
i'm not english.
i'm from south africa.
yeah, there's a giraffe in south africa.
see you thursday.
that's it.
coming with you wasn't part of our deal.
hey.
do you want my car or not?
yes, i do.
that's what i thought.
thank you.
good night.
you have some interesting choice of friends, man.
he was wearing these weird boots, man.
i have those boots!
yeah.
what else would i do?
we're partners, aren't we?
you'd do the same for me.
any other deals?
anything i should know?
that's it.
dan, what are you doing?
good luck.
i'll sort it out.
what are you doing?
am i not like someone who's trying not to go crazy in the face?
apparently.
i haven't opened them all yet.
are you looking for the stink?
let me ask you something, dan.
like i said, these boxes are full of crimes.
yeah... yeah... yeah...
think you can help?
this needs to get a little bit more light.
mysterious sunrise.
natural.
i like that.
don't die on me, dan.
don't die on me, dan.
don't die on me, dan.
dude, will you shut up?
i'm trying to talk to the phone!
yeah.
sort of.
in lubbock, "lill's an antique shop."
i don't know, man.
it's like a souvenir shop.
besides...?
god.
i've learned some information about the south american man.
excellent.
just focus on where the deal's going.
save the moustache.
save the moustache.
the smell of the candles is starting to drown me.
they smell like mysterious sunrise.
i think i'm gonna throw up.
i'll light more candles if you puke.
no.
give me that.
at least 0 kilos.
heroin.
it's heroin.
high pure.
small particles.
it's probably asian.
wow, you know a lot about heroin.
thank you.
so you're saying you're planning this?
i'm talking about being a cop.
and you, jack.
that's how we ended things together.
seriously?
"catch it, sal, then catch it again."
the bad guys only chase the criminal with a gun on their own.
the good cops are on the team chasing criminals with a gun in their hands.
thanks for the career advice.
hey, listen, dan...
what?
the truck is stopping.
why are we here so early?
what kind of trouble have you guys picking a place like this?
this little town is right between the states.
i mean, it's 000 miles from the nearest cop.
we don't get caught.
we're not even here.
just in case.
hi.
don't worry about the gunmen.
mikkel likes to carry a heavy weapon in case it's unpredictable.
i'm not worried.
it's so good to see you.
looks like we're doing a little work.
put the shotgun down.
on your knees.
excuse me?
i said, "get on your feet."
hey, hey, hey, hey cowboy.
what you're doing here... what you'
what the hell is going on here?
i'm sorry, wayne.
i made a deal, you son of a bitch!
everybody wins.
exactly.
what?
okay.
okay.
no confusion.
how was the meeting?
both unbelievable.
we'd better shoot both of them, get them.
son of a bitch.
i should have killed you when i had the chance.
enough!
let's finish this.
get the heroin in here and get out.
open the truck.
smell that?
come on!
come on!
remember, stick to the plan.
just the two of them.
we'll face the unexpected elements.
with a big attack, we'll disable them.
come on!
what the hell?
do you have a plan "b"?
come on!
shoot them!
traitor, son of a bitch!
i don't like the plan "b"!
it's a little early for you to visit here, isn't it, counselor?
i heard about the stark screw-up.
what happened?
it's about detective bailey.
it's usually warm.
last night i found an address on jack's desk...
hey!
we had a deal!
good day.
looks like you're in a bit of trouble.
not as much as it looks.
i think we're safe for now.
don't ever say "we're safe again!"
let's go!
who are these guys?
i don't know, and i don't care.
just kill them all and bring me the heroin.
cover me.
i'll call the lieutenant and call for backup.
lieutenant ruiz.
yes, lieutenant!
i'm detective bailey!
you haven't checked in for six hours.
where the hell are you?
it's a long story, okay?
detective stark and i need backup.
send code 0 or as many people as you can!
"lill's an antique shop."
it's 00 minutes from lubbock.
all right, we're under heavy fire!
it's 0 hours away, detective.
what the hell are you doing there?
long story.
just as many men as you can send, okay?
we're too late, man.
we're too late.
this stupid deal happened five minutes ago.
where's the address?
there must be somewhere around here.
man, come on.
here?
yeah.
he's back.
we just passed.
it's not a safe ride!
then you can talk about my driving.
backup comes in 00 minutes.
sounds about right.
we need to pull the bad guys towards the support team.
we'll cross the road with the cavalry.
good idea, dan.
right in front of you.
go!
if we're gonna die, this should be in a real car!
ready?
"let's go."
let's go!
get in the car!
go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
don't you know how to make contact?
what did they teach you at the academy?
go!
go, go, go, go!
son of a bitch!
you!
can't you make it go any faster?
it had a good engine!
this car is dead!
maybe we'd have been better off taking sedan.
you want some?
dan, when did you get that chocolate?
i went back to the store when you were on the phone.
it's got almond walnut walnuts... with
son of a bitch!
i want that heroin!
i don't think it's a very good situation anymore!
what, you think i haven't noticed?
take it!
come on.
come on!
hang on.
good!
that's exactly what i wanted.
that's what scared me.
no one's moving.
i think we're completely safe now.
you see what i see?
looks like a flaming truck.
got it!
i did!
get down!
are you okay?
yeah, fine.
but i was just fine.
yeah.
bastard!
got it!
he's taking the heroin and running.
jack.
partner, we have a bigger problem.
lower your weapons.
where's heroin?
you're lying!
he's not lying.
we left him in the middle of the road.
"paco" took him away.
who are you?
what were you doing behind the truck?
we're officers.
are you a cop?
are you kidding?
i'm not.
julius!
you did it!
i'll explain later.
can i hug you?
yes, you can.
come on!
okay.
you'd better get out of here.
sell your gun!
what the hell was that?
we hugged.
i'm a hugger.
it looked like there was a walnut stockade number 00.
anyway, he ran right over here...
no sign of paco.
what about heroin?
no sign of her either.
looks like he got away with it.
he doesn't have any witnesses.
and wayne young will testify against paco.
and i'm sure he's gonna say exactly the same thing...
"i'm gonna drag that bitch to hell with me."
well, that'll do.
yeah, but you know what's not gonna work?
i had no idea i'd be involved in this.
it just happened.
you came all this way because you were worried about me?
no.
i came all this way to see wayne young get arrested.
i'm so sorry, jack.
well, i stole a sports car and set the truck on fire.
did you even think about that?
we're questioning the south african guy.
did you know the giraffes lived there?
it's a holiday.
dan, we stole the pure heroin, okay?
it's hard to take as a victory.
"l can't say we're lost. "
what do you mean?
don't ever say "we're safe again!"
cover me.
i'll call the lieutenant and call for backup.
yes, lieutenant!
i'm detective bailey.
it's a long story, okay?
send code 0 or as many people as you can!
hey, old man...
sorry about the shooting.
how much is this gatekeeper?
five dollars.
that's bricks.
that's the paint.
i'll give you three dollars.
okay.
here you go.
three dollars.
how much for the chocolate?
00 cents each.
why would i do that?
i was hungry.
i'm not saying chocolate.
what made you change the packets?
well, you said everything would be good for the book, right?
yeah.
exactly.
i won't waste your time.
i brought you the best stuff.
it's the best heroin money can buy.
it'll be $000,000 in relief.
the price of the ball.
here.
"the alamo memorial"?
well, listen.
stop.
wayne young was captured within 00 hours and... and... and...
all $0.00.
actually, $0.00.
all i have to do... is... all i have
like i said, being a cop is teamwork.
but there isn't a lot of life like a desert.
hunters here spend their lives searching for rare and difficult prey.
000 tons of weight is the largest animal that ever lived with a 00-mile length.
despite their enormous size, the blue whales are the most aerodynamics and energy savings in all swimming animals.
they can travel over 000 miles a day in harts.
it takes a lot of effort to open your enormous mouth, so he only does it when he sees a rich, dense pack of crabs.
there's usually a lot of nurturing opportunities here.
when it's all over, the hunters have to continue their constant search.
frigate birds are pirates of open sea.
the frigates must be so light because they can't have the heavy grease that waterproof the feathers of other sea birds.
the little fish are trying to hide between the only protected dead waves in the ocean.
by the extra thrust of their tail, the flying fish can take off more than once.
with a good wind, they can float hundreds of meters.
all open ocean hunters can't go around looking for food.
he can barely swim.
this brown yosunfish has to lie in an ambush between the moss.
in this particular ocean, these knuckleheads are going to be very desirable with the cubs that want to hide.
finally, it's the first time in weeks.
only a few inches away from his prey can make a move.
he's hiding in the moss by trusting the perfect camouflage.
the oceans are so enormous that some hunters can only hunt for themselves by searching for the crew.
dolphins live in highly advanced social groups.
they can work together, cover a large area of the ocean.
little groups sometimes come together to create a thousand-dollar superpowers.
they use some kind of radar to find their prey.
but these little fish spend most of their time in the deep ocean, where dolphins can't reach.
they only hunt when they go up to the surface to feed.
when they find a lot of them, dolphins use their sonar for another purpose.
while the dolphins are feeding, they're coming from underneath the herd to keep their prey safe again.
as we go down there, food is scarce than at the surface, so the hunters must do whatever they can to protect their precious energy.
most of them are just dragged by tracing the tentacles full of deadly needles.
the others are slowly leading the darkness into the darkness with the power of the feathers.
beroe is the top jelly predator in deep water.
beroe's got special sharp-like spikes in her mouth to catch the jelatum hunt.
this deep inkfish uses long sticky tentacles to hunt.
the open ocean may be a large blue desert, but like every desert, there are savages.
the sea, by turning the direction of the deep ocean currents up into the surface, forced the nutrients to surface.
success here depends on delicate manoeuvres.
to conceal a false sense of confidence in his prey in a flat-seeking area.
the lions of the lion fish are visually confusing, so it's hard to imagine how close he is for his prey.
and the extravagant fins he used to hide his slow tail movements are making him more superior.
these deep-water currents that give a lot of quiet lives are also attracting visitors to these savages.
they travel hundreds of miles between the seas they used as a gathering point.
both sharkfish are traveling between the galapagos and the other sea mountains east of the great ocean.
no one knows why they've gathered so many, but some certainly come to these savages looking for food.
if these little fish stay close to the mercena, the sharks won't reach them.
as long as they keep the silverfish close to the ocean floor, they can avoid predators.
there's never easy food in the open ocean.
here, the blizzard was exposed to the storm, creating a place of isolated blessings, carrying food to the surface.
the black eyebrow is the same size as the frogat generation, but three times as heavy, so he needs a completely different kind of flight.
albatros is the type of bird with the longest wingspan, and that enables the power of the southern sea winds to exploit it.
first, they glide against the wind and use it to gain its energy from altitude.
and then they'll turn and swarm at the wind, and make speed.
most of the hunt, they spend weeks at sea without ever returning to the land.
as the winds are so strong here, albatross can't afford the weight of grease that makes their feathers waterproof.
they can dive to one meter, so they rely on you to steal the southern ocean that will carry your prey into range.
like all birds, albatross have to eggs on land, but there are very few available islands in the south atlas, which are very large.
every year, about a million albatross come here to raise their young.
the grown-ups are coming back to feed their puppies in a few days, sharing their parental duties.
when the feeding process is over, it's time to head for the sea.
the albatross are so heavy they can only take off where the wind is strong enough.
from the air, the ocean may seem unstable, but under the surface, there are strong currents that are constantly moving.
these currents are more effective than any other force, determined by the distribution of life here.
all the organisms that have been dragged across the ocean will be connected to these patterns.
they come together to feed on tiny plants and animals, and fresh plankton from the currents.
the hairs on their legs are slowing down their hairs, and they're floating up a few tails in their lungs.
the currents that carry these traveling crabs are also working for the ocean's big predators.
with the perfect aerodynamic structure, they can travel the longest distance of asagari effort.
these hunters touch a shuttlecraft between the ocean currents that often meet.
each predator has senses of extraordinary sense of smell that can trace unpredictable traces of the prey.
big shoals are attracted to the charm of plankton bolts.
a bunch of sardines could be miles long.
it depends on self-defense.
when the attack comes, the sardines move like one body.
each fish is able to fit into the movement of the one next to him and the entire herd is acting as a match.
even when more sea lion arrives, they don't seem to break the sardines' coordinated defenses.
the sea lions need to isolate a lot of other small control groups that are so big.
but with so little predators the fish still have the advantage.
all the sea lions can do is keep the sardines on the surface and wait for others to join them.
tuna attacks from below, so the sardines cut off their escape route to the deep water.
as the fish tighten the saplings, the packages are making the hunters' work easier.
tons of sardines run out in less than an hour.
the predators disappear into their own way once more in blue.
this blue whale is still searching for food to dispose of its hunger.
because he's so big, he has to find an average of 0 tons of food a day.
it's a crowded croquet that's trapped in the face because of the fish.
this blue whale has finally found what he's been looking for for so long.
a meal big enough to open your big mouth.
the rag is hundreds of metres long, and it's clusted down to the bottom.
the whale is targeting the busiest part of the pack, and it's moving at the track of his prey.
it takes a lot of effort to swim with a fully expand throat, and the whale is having a stand-up.
as he uses his tongue to throw the water out of his mouth, he's saving the creatures on the roof of his jaw.
but it takes time to wipe so much water.
the blue whales may not be as agile as the other hunters, but they don't have to be.
no other predator is more convenient to resign from the messed-up richness that the oceans provide.
the blue whale is the biggest hunter of all oceans in the world.
the oceans have created a lot of trouble for the "av" team.
it's been a two-year mission.
the team worked with john calambokidis, the world's most important blue whale expert in the world.
john received vital information from these harmless tags.
it's part of this research, and the reason we're working with the filmmakers is that it's a unique chance that we can't get us any scientific data.
so what they're doing underwater, how they're diving, how they're swimming, how they're feeding, we're doing this through our search warrant.
the team's success is based on a good six-pack of sight.
the lot and the whale are literally disappearing in the darkness.
we didn't.
the first year was touched by poor visibility, and the shooting ended in failure.
second year, sea conditions are better.
the blue whales only go to the surface in 0 minutes before diving in 00 minutes.
he's got to try to move the boat forward to the whale, but it's not right in front of him.
then he's gonna have to hop in the water and hope the whale passes close enough to get it on the record.
this year the water is unorthodox, but it still takes time to keep david in a good position.
after weeks of effort, all the elements finally come together and give david the chance of his life.
it took me a long time, too long.
i mean, it was big, like a freight train.
the blue whale images underwater are rare, so it's a tremendous achievement to record a simple- floating whale.
this series is all about hunting, so it's a nice shot, but we're gonna have to take a look at the blue whales eating krill.
and we're gonna have to wait for the killer to surface completely.
once a month, maybe twice.
the team is hitting on a promising realm, but it's a rather unpleasant source.
look at those birds in the water!
we're gonna go take a look.
look at that bitch!
i still don't understand what i just saw.
david saw her, turned the camera.
he took a turn, he went up and took a big bite.
they're called blue whales, you see them underwater, bright, flaming cobalt blue, and they'll come out of the blue of the ocean with their color blue.
i was upstairs trying to get another image of the krils, and, of course, his mouth was open, one last time.
it was probably less than ten minutes, but no doubt, without question, the most unqualified, most amazing thing i've ever seen.
it's something i'll never forget, to share water with a blue whale and to be in the eye.
and the opposite.
yeah, that's a unique perspective we'll never see.
with this intimate cooperation, the team has taken blue whales into a film that has never been seen before, and eventually started to reveal the secret lives of the ocean's greatest hunter.
you like him!
no, i don't.
every friend i've ever had inappropriate, likes her.
so sad, isn't it?
when mia went away as a exchange student, we made a list of pros and cons, and it helped clarify our feelings.
yes, ethan karamakov...
abigail sent over a list of pros and cons to the entire school.
look, i'm coming to stay with you for a while.
no, i won't cause any trouble.
i won't stay forever.
okay.
double brent frappe.
and petit battent.
everybody thinks farm's a dangerous place.
relieve.
i know every rabbit hole, broken fence and rusty nail.
and nice sleeves.
it doesn't matter where i am, i'm safe.
in, tara.
and blasce.
everybody out there.
tara, you can join us.
but the academy is a completely different world.
if you think you know your way, think again.
in fact, you'll notice you're in a minefield.
wherever i go, i see a new trap...
"it smells like christmas...
"her way of eating.
"everything he talks about is true."
could it be worse?
yeah, well, you're asking...
at least i'm not the first minus on your list.
i think i should be grateful for that.
i'm really sorry, kat.
i didn't mean to involve you in my confusion.
believe me, i've tried so hard not to feel this way.
here's a good reason.
my brother will break your heart, and when he does, i won't be there to fix the pieces.
i promise i'll stay away from him.
do you think abigail sent it to third graders?
ethan read it.
kill me.
yeah, one question for you.
who can tell me the true meaning of "pas de deaux"?
pas deux.
it means "dancing dance."
but what does it mean beyond french words, metaphorically?
pas deux.
two bodies, one soul.
a man and a woman are pure and dancing with the same emotions.
today's lesson is about it.
i've never danced with a man before.
right.
at home, the girls danced with girls.
there were no men.
the men in first class are just cute creatures that crush their fingers.
pas deux has three important rules.
trust.
throw it at someone.
unity.
great wonder great wonder great wonder great wonder
and, most of all, communication.
without these, yes...
ethan, isabelle, it's very nice of you to join.
remember, in order to be together, you have to trust and communicate.
do your hands always stick like this?
i'm allergic to you.
focus on who you're dancing with.
no one else should matter.
you want to drop it?
relax.
you're doing pretty well.
what a great class?
i mean, patrick's such a great teacher.
don't you think the universe is trying to bring us together?
la-la-la-la-la.
before you go, miss raine and i talked about not doing any lessons for the rest of your days.
don't get excited.
instead, you're gonna work out an exercise for me.
don't forget, you're going to be judged just as you are in other classes.
that was a blow!
i'll be walking a blindfold dog.
at least you don't have to spend 00 hours with abigail like me.
i'd rather rip my eyes off with a blind knife.
i know we'll ask our wives 00 questions in 00 hours.
this?
"you can ask each one of you any questions any questions.
"but you must answer honestly."
like i'd like to know something about christian.
so you're not alone.
i'm a bowler, my favorite dish is a pizza, a lucky number, and we're done.
i know all about you.
your whole school is being broadcast live life.
where are you going?
beach.
i love this town.
i want to check in.
i'm going to go find christian.
we'll be there, check out the pretty girls.
great!
oh, i'm beginning to like this assignment.
are you a slayer or something?
so where did you grow up?
a suburbs.
near the beach?
you're lucky.
you think i'm rich?
do you have a brother or sister?
he lives in broken hill.
i mean, are you emotionally close?
so, the room is made of flesh and blood.
he's doing something.
you have to answer.
says who?
rules.
how far did you go with a man?
there's a phase one.
and there's a second step.
did anybody ever get into your city?
have you ever kissed a man?
you didn't, did you?
maybe i can help you.
maybe you can get lost in front of me.
hey, there were questions i'd like to ask.
and i'm trying to strengthen my stomach here.
we can do these on the beach.
i don't come to the beach.
you allergic to fresh air?
i don't like sand, i don't like salt, and i don't like sun.
great.
i need water.
me too.
we hate you enough to want you to die of thirst.
i don't care what his favorite color or his family do.
so did he say anything to you?
he did it!
"oh, let's go to the beach to do homework.
"it'll be so much fun!"
i didn't know he'd be here.
really.
what are you doing here?
we come to ourselves as third graders.
you shouldn't be bitching here right now.
you can play with us if you want.
i may have a blind eye, but i'm not blind.
come on, it's just football.
whoo!
you coming, tara?
i think i'm staying.
i haven't finished my homework with christian yet.
come on, we're getting out of here.
you know, in this scenario, it's in the toilets.
you can.
no, i can't hold it for 00 hours.
i'm starving.
yeah, me too.
i'm gonna go, i'm
i'm gonna go get some food.
this place is closed against the incense.
find another toilet.
why do men have to smell the toilet so bad?
why do you have to be so bad?
that's right.
they stink.
what you did was more than just a crime and an eunuch.
just think about it, and get it done quick before we both die of oxygen.
i can't, can you please hum a song or something like that?
hurry up.
i still don't understand why you sent that list to everyone.
you're just as uncomfortable as a fly that's always buzzing.
it just made you look bad.
okay, don't say anything.
there you go.
hey, where's tara?
i don't know.
huh.
whoa!
hey, baby.
there's a lot of room in my lap.
hey!
i wrote this, princess!
come on, we'll catch them later.
you want to die?
didn't you see what they were trying to do to me?
you can't fight around here.
anyway, what are you still doing here?
if you want to know, i was waiting for the bus.
what did you see me in a limo?
you don't know anything about me.
i don't think i want to know either.
i've never met anyone as rude as you.
didn't your mother teach you manners?
he's dead.
look, if you're worried, all you have to do is call.
who says i'm curious?
i'm just checking my messages.
what do you know?
i can understand everything.
this whole communication thing must have started something.
yeah?
can you see that?
ow.
i can't imagine what it's like to lose your mother.
no, you can't.
was she dancing?
yeah, he was young.
is that why you wanted to get into the academy?
you're leaving?
i won't.
i don't believe you.
i saw you dancing!
right.
he lives in broken hill.
very good.
and let's say i'm in trouble.
i don't know, probably.
you said you were close.
so you're saying he answered, right?
brothers help their brothers?
maybe until you call him.
the room only opens when you call another number, so she doesn't know it was me.
now you know everything.
right or wrong?
i'd say it's wrong, but...
see, you haven't learned anything.
my brother and i are very close.
i have one question left.
question 00.
ask him.
why did you tell everyone i was dressed in the wrong dressing room?
you knew it was a mistake.
why would i even bother?
i don't believe you're still lying about it.
i know you did.
you know, i wasn't the only guy there.
have you thought about that?
tara, what were you thinking?
you think he's...?
do you think it's 0-0 or 00 written here?
two and four hours.
you want to know why i'm bad with tara?
because you three are so stupid!
i need to talk to you.
like you don't know.
you've been laughing behind my back all this time, haven't you?
sorry?
at the start of the audition week... you told everyone i was in the wrong locker room.
it was you, wasn't it?
come on, admit it was a funny thing.
and leaving me alone on the beach?
it's fun, isn't it?
but you weren't with us.
didn't you answer my pros and pros list?
i didn't realize i had to answer.
of course you were supposed to.
the whole school is laughing at me because of you.
why would it be because of me?
look, if you want to hear the truth, i'm ashamed of that list.
i mean, we only talked to you three or four times, right?
and you went and wrote everything you felt and sent it to the whole school.
i don't even know you.
tara?
tara?
he can't talk to you.
yeah, he can.
i thought you were sick of girls coming to you after ethan.
because i hate seeing my friends upset.
growing up, my parents used to warn me about all the dangers.
we're gonna have to realize it all by ourselves... here... all by o
prove to me yesterday's paper isn't a waste of time.
good job, boys.
whether we like it or not, we're connected with ropes that will never break apart for the next year.
so there's a long way ahead of us.
good morning.
good morning, bette.
mm-hmm.
go get dressed.
i want to be there when they open it.
okay.
i already threw a candy.
just one.
here's your napkin.
you want butter?
here you go.
good morning.
be careful.
the inspector's here.
good morning, mrs. tremont.
good morning, mr. korman.
mr. tremont.
hi.
yeah.
what can i do for you, miss tremont?
it says here that the pork chops are sold.
in the meantime, all of what you saw was in the commercial.
how are those pork chops?
we're not selling them.
the ad says pork chops, mr. korman.
no pictures or id numbers.
so what do you want, miss tremont?
i want these ribs off that price.
got it.
jake.
hey!
jake.
ah... ah... ah... ah...
well, first of all, i'm sorry it's up to you, john, but we have a personnel problem you should know about.
this guy we're getting, he can't decide between us and goldman.
i know you hate this, but you gotta come in here and use your magic wand.
is he that good?
let's not kidnap this guy.
these kids from work school think they're worth $000,000 a week when they work.
i hate your attitude.
okay, set this up with kathy for the weekend.
i got notes for the next day.
the vale project has given us a lot of directions, but management is objecting to our suggestions that we provide information that the investors are so profitable about why the company is so profitable.
they don't want to give so much information to their competitors.
i don't know why we have to cooperate with this vale guy.
a dark type.
we're risking the company's reputation.
if we turn him down, we'll never get a job from him again.
a giant fee demands it and the banking department wants it.
i'm worried about my wife's share this year.
lower your price.
i think it's the earlyest worries i've ever recorded in a cardiac arrest.
yeah?
your sister's on the line, mr. tremont.
he says it's important.
he said he needed to talk to you right away.
i'm in a meeting.
john, this is about our mother.
he had a heart attack.
he's fine now, but he's serious.
can you come?
hey!
how was the flight?
good one.
the guy next to me didn't leave me alone.
he heard i was on wall street, so don't ask.
"how are the stock options?
i see.
have you heard of a stock called chrometex?
mario.
seriously, someone mentioned the math department.
they're generating heat sensors for low temperatures capsules.
it's gonna be bigger than the phone.
no.
no?
no.
good.
at home with your father.
home or the hospital first?
whatever.
let's go to the hospital.
that's what i thought.
how's dad?
to be honest, johnny, he was a little shaken up.
that's why annie's staying with her.
she doesn't want him to be alone.
so how's mom?
how serious is she?
he can't really admit he had a heart attack.
he's lying there because of a heart attack, and he's claiming he's disgusting.
he blames me.
what do you mean?
he says it's because of the sausages i made for dinner.
he claims i was trying to kill him.
did you do it?
no jury can blame me, john.
i believe you.
if you're here, i'm a pretty sick person.
look, mom, that's why you're the best.
in your case, a lot of people wouldn't feel guilty.
how are you?
do you have any pain?
i'm alive because of my will.
he'll tell you.
i have the willpower of a woman half my age.
don't throw yourself in your face.
have you seen your father?
no, i came straight from the airport.
if you see him, don't say anything about a heart attack.
just tell me something's wrong with me.
okay?
mom.
listen to me.
just say something's wrong with her.
he'll think i'm sleeping because i'm getting my uterus.
okay.
if you must eat outside, go to mcdonald's or wendy's.
somewhere simple.
mom, you shouldn't worry about dad right now.
i think you should think about yourself right now.
you had a heart attack.
i'm not sure i had a heart attack.
it pains me more like gas pains.
mom, if it was gas pains, they'd give you acid cure.
they wouldn't have tied you to $00 million worth of machines.
did you see the doctor who took care of me?
because i don't believe he's a real doctor.
he was wearing a tight pants with a big silver belt.
not more than 00 years old.
nowadays they graduate everybody from medical school.
john!
god, it's so good to see you.
you came and saw your mother first, huh?
yeah.
how she looked at you, john, tell me the truth.
like my mother.
it was like he was gonna drag the iv bottles and get out of there.
i mean, it's just gas pains.
i'm sure he told you that, too.
and his will?
like a half-year-old woman.
you look so modern.
where do i put your bags, sir?
oh, put it down there for a bother.
thank you very much.
no luggage in the living room.
you know the rules.
i'm taking them out of your old bedroom.
is the living room still off-limits?
you're kidding.
this looks just like the smithson's.
dad's out there, huh?
yeah, green house.
what's he doing there?
mario said he was very difficult to accept.
he's scared, john.
he's really scared.
i'm not sure you understand what's going on with him.
what do you mean?
she saw him, didn't she?
i didn't want to drag him there.
i told her she wasn't allowed visitors, and she seems to understand that.
hi, dad.
hi, john.
good to see you.
you look good.
good to see you too.
i'll stay here a few days.
did you hear what happened to your mother?
how is he?
good.
good.
he wanted me to say hi, and he said he'd be home soon.
something's wrong with your body, isn't it?
something like that.
it doesn't work well in your old room, you know.
you should use a second blanket.
okay.
as long as you're here, the most important thing is to make sure everything's fine.
your mother has a calendar, and her life is a really long routine.
and a sugar.
they cut coupons in the morning, they make a shopping list.
it's very important.
i wrote you a list of pills.
when did he get so bad?
i haven't seen him in a year.
no, you're wrong.
what are you talking about?
i was here for christmas.
annie, i need to know that.
okay, i saw him two years ago.
a lot happens in two years.
why didn't you tell me?
i tried to get her to us, but she wasn't comfortable.
we both work all day.
but there's a garden and green house here.
he knows the environment.
i can only stay here a few days.
and then what?
can't you stay longer?
i have to go to boston.
impossible.
we have to bring someone home.
but we have to find the right person.
my father's old, john.
yeah.
come on, dad, let's hit the head, huh?
johnny.
i can't find my pyjamas.
i don't know where your mother put them.
here.
why don't you put them on, dad?
i will.
are you okay?
i miss your mom.
he'll get what he needs.
good rest.
he'll be home soon.
good night.
good night.
keep the lights on.
okay.
sleep well.
i don't eat much in the morning, johnny.
it was good, though.
thanks, dad.
you're cooking a lot, aren't you?
not really.
i've been eating out since sara and i got divorced.
yeah, she was a nice girl.
still is.
how's billy?
he's in santa cruz.
freshman in college.
she came to visit once.
so you've seen him more than i have.
look at this, johnnie.
it's a double coupon day at ralph's.
two cans of tuna is $0.00.
amazing.
how much is a tuna fish in new york?
it's not $0.00, i bet.
no, i disagree.
impossible.
listen, dad, i want to talk to you about mom for a minute.
there's something you need to understand.
mom's sick.
it's not cancer, is it?
no, no, it's not cancer.
cancer kills, you know.
your uncle ben's had five operations.
nothing's done to him.
i'm telling you, if you're in cancer, you should pack your bags.
look, it's not cancer.
a heart attack.
will he be all right?
yeah, he's gonna be fine.
but he won't work as hard as he used to.
he'll have to learn to take it easy, and you have to help him with that.
i'm always telling him you work too hard.
johnny, he works very hard.
you need to learn a few things you can do at home.
look, mom made you believe that no one else could look after you.
we're gonna try to fix him wrong.
i got it, johnny.
i'm gonna learn how to do all this.
you'll see.
we're gonna make fun of him.
okay, dad, let's see what we need to do first, let's see,
"cut the coloredites from the whites."
so, dark matter doesn't mix with white colors.
copy that.
i think that's what your mom used to do.
now we know we're on the right track.
okay, let's start with the colors, okay?
these are colored.
color.
white, color, color.
white.
color.
color.
and this?
him?
he's white.
okay, this is colorful.
dad, he must be one of these.
i think we should call your mom.
i'm gonna do a job here.
okay.
what do you think we got?
"e, normal.
i'm trying normal.
what kind of water should we use?
"cold, cold-cold, warm, warm, warm, warm, warm-foot, warm-hot."
what the hell is this?
hot-hot.
i think he was white.
she'll be ready for thursday.
yeah.
what's the easiest way to get to the store, dad?
i don't know about these streets, john.
your mother will take us where we need to go.
you never drive?
never?
i can't.
my license expired a few years ago.
didn't you get another driver's license?
well, they wanted me to go through a test for my age.
you failed the test?
i didn't take the test.
i was afraid i wouldn't pass.
what are you talking about?
you used a great car.
johnny, a good driver knows when he can't drive, that's all.
i couldn't remember what you liked, so i took a little bit of everything.
great.
well... well... well... well... well
these are beautiful.
i want to see your mom, johnny.
i don't think that's a good idea right now, dad.
i mean, my mom's fine, but they wouldn't want to accept visitors.
i'm her husband.
i need to see him.
that's not true.
excellent.
he made me breakfast this morning.
no, i'm not serious.
i don't know, he's built a box.
yeah.
everything's fine.
okay, bye-bye.
okay, dad.
annie's meeting with the people at the hospital.
or he thinks they'll let you see him in a day or two.
good.
yeah.
what?
i can do the dishes.
i've coded these cards by color.
there's a different code card here for the housework.
for example, now, the pink ones are for washing dishes.
go ahead, take a look and see what number he's got.
number one: number one: number one:
"f fill it with water."
okay.
number two?
"gave some soap."
okay.
"put dishes in soaked water."
i made these for you to work on your own.
these are great, johnny.
if i follow these cards, there's no reason for me to make a mistake.
i'm gonna watch these.
i'll show you how to burn the stove, dad.
no, on the other hand, the stove is off-limits for now.
no stove.
and stay away from that blender.
no flapping.
i think i should work with this.
your mom wouldn't want me to wear this.
i look so rude.
like johnny cash.
you don't think that when you put this on, do you?
no, dad, i don't think so.
don't take your guns into town, son.
leave those guns at home.
bang, bang.
"fill the powder."
professional floor wax, father.
you can see yourself on the floor.
no trace of cila.
you know what i think?
i think we should reward ourselves.
what do you mean?
let's go out and have a good time.
what do you say?
okay.
okay.
what do you and mom do here for fun?
"i" 00. 00. 00. 00.
"i" two-zero.
"o" 00. 00. 00. 00.
seven-five.
"b" 00. 00. 00 "b" 00.
"b" one-one.
look up, all right?
"g" 00. "g" 00. 00g
"g" is five-eight.
are you kidding?
does the air conditioning work here, father?
or a fan or something?
"i" 00... 00... 00...
choo-choo!
i love what they do.
do they always?
"b" 0. "b" 0." 0.
and after!
boy, it's fun tonight.
"i" 00. 00. 00. 00.
bingo!
bingo!
jake tremont, is that you?
hal mccarthy.
how are you?
remember gloria?
my son, john.
she's visiting from new york.
how are you?
is bette here?
no, he's in the hospital.
that's good to hear.
give us our past lives.
we will.
thank you.
you heard about nick price, didn't you?
he's dead.
oh, yeah.
nick, robin, dorothy, twins.
all of them.
the whole table.
and delores patcher in the next desk.
gone.
he's dead.
well, it's good to see you again.
it's been a while.
a long time.
nice to meet you.
they're like fresh air.
i know your bingo.
haven't you been here long, dad?
when was the last time you played here?
it's been three years.
you're kidding.
why did you stop coming?
i don't know.
we had a lot of fun with your mom here, more than anybody else, but...
we don't do what we love anymore.
i don't know why.
i think you should remember what you enjoyed and start doing them again.
that's a good idea.
john, i'm gonna write this down.
i'm gonna make a list of the things we enjoyed.
yes, sir.
bingo.
what?
i think you did bingo.
hey, i got bingom!
i was worried about you, john.
i'm afraid you'll have an addict.
we should take a look at this.
we can win, and we can get regular profits.
i know a kid in new york, i'll consult him.
it's super between numbers.
he'll make a system for us.
you'll see.
we're gonna beat these guys, dad.
sorry, i didn't want to leave you so late.
it's like it's christmas night tonight.
the only thing missing here is guy lombardo.
he's dead.
i'm afraid hal mccarthy didn't mention that.
big day tomorrow.
let's go to bed.
good night, john.
good night, dad.
"b" 0. "b" 0." 0.
and then.
there they are, dad.
hi, dad.
you're kidding me.
you ready to see him, dad?
i can't believe dad looks so good.
you think so?
thanks to you, john.
i'm fine with her.
that was fun.
listen, i hired someone to keep an eye on the house.
he'll be back in a day or two.
i can stay home until mom gets home.
really?
yeah, no problem.
hey, bette.
are you okay?
mm-hmm.
you swallowing blood pressure pills?
are you eating?
yeah, i'm fine, bette.
i can make my own bed now.
and i'm washing dishes.
john teaches me how to cook.
she's like a real wife.
just keep him alive until i get back.
thanks for the tip.
mom looks good, doesn't she?
yeah, great.
i can't go anywhere without my tubes.
i meant your face, mom.
my color?
what are you, a decorator?
don't call me mom.
do i call you son?
don't be so nice to mom, mario.
you're gonna kill him.
why are you cooking?
there was food in the fridge.
i told you.
we just wanted a little change, that's all.
we had salmon last night.
and we ate 'coq au vin' one night.
your father doesn't like foreign food.
just chicken with red wine.
he shouldn't drink red wine.
mom, that was it.
i don't want her to turn into a drunk when i'm here.
nobody's an alcoholic who eats coq au vin.
easy, bette.
don't worry about everything.
just focus on healing here and don't worry about me.
you sure you want to come, dad?
it's gonna be a long meeting.
no, i will.
sounds good to me.
i can buy you lunch here, and you can watch a movie.
i'll sit down, i'll read a magazine.
i'll be fine.
okay.
john tremont, i'd like to see vic walton, please.
he's waiting for you.
dad, are you gonna be okay here with all this repairs?
of course, nobody's gonna drop anything on me.
john, glad to see you.
sorry for the confusion.
good to see you, too, vic.
this is my father, jake tremont.
dad, this is vic walton.
nice to meet you, mr. tremont.
me too.
can we be here in an hour?
like i said.
okay, well, take care, dad.
wait a minute.
we can't leave your father here.
come on, mr. tremont, why don't you come in and sit with us?
i don't think-- think i'
ralph, we've given you all the privileges, and our predictions now show that our wife is 00% less than yours.
how can you be so sure of yourself?
you-you've never followed a job like this before.
and if you're wrong, we're gonna be the laughing stock and we're never gonna do business with you again.
stop running the canned factory.
he loses money every minute he's open, but the land he's got is worth at least 00 million.
how can you be so sure of $00 million?
we could give him a little bit of a jackpot for 00 million.
do you have any backup information?
can i get back to my position now?
we don't have a problem with all the moving jobs around $00 million.
they can handle all the overheads, but the plan we have is that we have to eliminate 00% of the executive personnel within a few months.
isn't it enough just to sell it?
that way the accounting records will be handled.
if this goes well, you won't have to.
i don't think they're focused on that.
we can change that.
it's about the food wholesalers, and it's a good sector on the promise.
now, our cash flow in our department seems to be a trespasser, but it's not satisfying.
when we consider everything, we have no problem getting credit from the banks.
yeah, that looks good.
johnny, what's going on out there?
well, we're gonna buy a salmon canned canvas factory, dad.
i didn't know you knew about something like this.
actually, i don't know.
the man who came to us for money has no knowledge.
we're just gonna get the company, and then we're gonna put an end to the activity.
is that your job?
you buy companies, and then you turn it off?
my work is a little complicated, dad.
we're taking this canned factory.
then the company gets a mess.
this third generation is taking over, and the production is horribly down.
but there's a small amount of patio companies, and that's what the job is about.
the factory is built on a precious land near the sea.
so we buy the factory, close it, then take it over to the front desk, and then sell the land.
and you never thought about running these companies?
there's no money, dad.
the world has changed, johnny.
you can't believe how the world changes.
when you were a kid, you used to go to work with me to lockeheed, remember?
i'd take apart the shells and touch them.
they'd give me 00 cents a day, and i'd buy a ham-cheese sandwich for that money.
when you grew up, you'd tell me you wanted to work there, with me.
but what you do now is buy and then turn it off.
dad, did you hear about those lockheed guys?
rick malinson?
tommy williams?
they're all gone.
to the valley, palm springs... to palm springs...
there was nobody there to say goodbye to me.
the next morning, there wasn't someone who did my job.
the two worlds split into two groups:: the
...workers and bosses.
i don't know, dad, i-i-i don
it's all right, johnny.
there's nothing wrong here.
i'm a businessman, that's all.
but you're different.
you like to be in control.
you like responsibility.
you're a boss.
mom?
what do you think?
yes, father.
"if you hit a car parked in a car, and you don't find the owner of the car... and you don't find the owner
why are you doing this?
i've already passed the written test.
i know, but you may not be too careful.
a lot of the samples here could be on the driver's test.
i want to get you ready for this.
very good.
thank you.
we've come this far.
i don't want to see anything go wrong now.
they want us to pull over there.
go.
slow, slow down, not so fast.
okay, stop.
there he is.
jake tremont?
actually, it's jake tremont.
i'm his son, john.
i guess you didn't need to know that, but you heard.
you can't sit here during the test, sir.
oh, sorry.
oh, you can't stay in the car.
what are you talking about?
this is my father.
that's the rules.
i'm not gonna test you as long as you're in the car.
either you get out now, or your father is a failure in the test.
everything okay?
it'll be fine if you do.
as you walked out of your car parked out of your car parked-- traffic
john?
i'm going.
i'll check the bikes and the other vehicles.
yes!
while waiting on the left turn, give it priority to the cars from the warehouse.
make sure all the cars that could be dangerous have passed.
yes!
oh, look who's here.
hey, dad.
hey, billy.
hey... hey... hey
my grandmother's sick.
i just ran.
i thought you might need me, grandpa.
don't even think about helping grandpa.
when was the last time you had lunch?
why are you americans so obsessed with food?
you know, when in rome...
what were you doing in mexico?
semester break.
a couple of my friends are there.
dad, you say that every time we meet.
and i haven't grown up in two years.
how's your mom?
good.
it's the third year of law and class number one.
if your mom's taking more notes than you, it's embarrassing, but we're working.
send my love.
how are you?
you win, sometimes you lose.
if i know you, you're earning more than you've lost.
if you're finished, why don't you grab a piece of cake?
he looks great.
what's going on?
well, we spend a lot of time together.
pretty good time, huh?
they say this is very good for parents and children.
maybe you and i should spend more time together.
this place looks great, grandpa.
too much.
looking good.
i'll give you a name after you, bill.
who wants butter?
you want some butter, honey?
i want to make a toast.
aha.
a lot has happened in the last two weeks.
we've overcome some difficulties, and we've had some pain.
we put it all together as a team.
now it's thanksgiving.
great, mario.
it's my usual conversation.
actually, i'd like to say how nice to see our family together and happy.
my chicken's getting cold.
it's over.
very good.
i'm having a toast.
hmm.
wow, dad.
to my dear bride.
your bride?
have you had a drink today, jake?
before you came, mother, we drank two glasses of scoq au vin.
to my dear bride... my dear br
bette, welcome back to our family, where you belong.
it's so good to be home.
listen, listen.
nice speech, dad.
it's nice to have everybody here.
and i don't remember the last time john billy and i were together.
billy looks good.
i like that earring.
should i put it on?
i have a needle for him if you want.
oh, leave her alone, mom.
it looks great.
i bet the girls are gonna jump on you.
don't worry about me.
it's not embarrassing.
the dorm is a man with a girl.
is that true?
yeah, there's a girl-man mix in our dorm.
i'm glad it wasn't like this in our time.
if i had, i wouldn't have finished school.
it's like you're a student to me.
mario was a great student, mom.
he graduated from physics.
he hasn't read a book, he's finished a licking switch.
yeah, but all the good students read books with me at the same time and ended up with a licking switch.
but john was a good student.
thank you, mommy.
every friday we went out of the nest and went to the library.
we'd buy two books.
you'd read them, we'd give them back, then we'd get 0 new books.
you've done more than that.
and how did it work?
were the girls on the other floor?
somebody shut that guy up.
i'm just happy.
let's make things easier for grandma and grandpa while you're here.
of course, you're used to hearing it, but you can't believe it's real.
i do, believe me.
my fillings are still ringing.
sorry.
so when do you have to go back to school?
i'm not going back to school.
i'm thinking of hanging out in mexico for a while.
what's the joke of mexico?
all mexicans try to come here.
did you know that?
there's a couple of kids at school.
they have a lot of similar side.
oh, that's good.
yeah, it's fun, but believe it or not, but someday you're gonna want to work, bill.
lying on the coast of mexico won't do you any good.
if you don't want to be a mariachi singer, you have to finish a school no matter what.
i'd say i went to college.
i got a phd.
i did the right thing.
two phds.
one is chemistry, one of the physics.
i'll be back in new york soon, and i'd like to get this straight.
what does your mother think?
he thinks i can make my own decision.
i'm not sure how i feel about this.
we need to talk more about it.
i don't understand why.
he hasn't been talked about it until now, and i know what i want.
johnny, something's wrong.
can you come here and take a look?
that's enough, mr. tremont.
you can get dressed if you want.
is he okay?
yeah, good.
it's a difficult process.
it hasn't spread yet.
what do you think is the problem?
it could be one of a few things.
i doubt it's the kangists in the bladder.
the problem is whether he's got a good heart.
will this show up on your tests?
not completely.
his bleeding isn't a good sign.
so it's serious?
i think we should get him through a general operation.
if it was serious, father, they wouldn't leave you.
they'd open it right away and operate under the spot.
i wouldn't be surprised if it was just a cyst.
i don't think we should tell mom about this.
why worry if there's nothing out there?
whatever you say, johnny.
you're the boss.
he told you, didn't he?
of course he did.
then you know it's not serious.
if it's not serious, you should have told me yourself.
look, mom, you need to stay away from a possible stress case right now.
you'll be sad for nothing.
that's why i didn't tell you.
he says it's just a cyst.
that's right.
it's going to be a simple operation.
yes, it is.
mom, if anything went wrong, i'd tell you.
make sure.
okay.
i'm just gonna walk around here, john, like all the nurses here, you want me to walk around with your ass open?
yeah.
that's what it says in your acceptance form here, in here
"grow is forbidden."
go to bed.
you need to sign this, dad.
what is it?
i don't have any baseball gloves.
bad joke.
dr. santana prepared these medications.
it'll just help you relax.
if you've got too much, i'll drink a bit.
extra money for the private room.
what time is it?
it's evening.
isn't it late yet?
no.
are you comfortable, dad?
fine.
i'll let you get some rest.
it'll make you sleep like a baby.
okay.
remember, if you need anything, just ring that bell.
that's all, huh?
you'll be fine.
you know, john, i see some men, they hug each other.
we've never embraced.
shall we give it a try?
come on.
i love you, johnny.
i love you, too, dad.
okay, mr. tremont, i'm afraid it's cancer.
cancer.
we ran into a couple of bad guys.
your father won't be with anybody his age.
well, it's gonna be a silly question, but are you sure about that?
yeah.
the good thing is we can reach him and destroy him.
listen, dr. santana.
whatever you do, don't tell my father it's cancer.
he's very alarmed, and he's terrified of that word.
say something more reasonable.
calm down, mr. tremont.
you'd be surprised what others have been through.
they don't even care about the kids.
i'm not taking this lightly, doctor.
i just want to tell him myself, that's all.
it's cancer, isn't it?
mom, i told you.
it's just a cyst and they'll take it.
i want to see him.
mom!
mom, you can't see her right now.
will you listen to me?
you shouldn't be subjected to this kind of stress.
if it's all right, let me see him.
oh, come on, mom!
john only wants what's best for you.
you know.
you have to listen to her, mom.
he's my husband and i'll see him.
now you take me there, or i walk, but i'm going.
what's there?
billy, go quickly, find dr. santana.
come on!
get out of here.
what happened to him?
jake, it's me!
why didn't he know me?
jake!
mr. tremont, this is dr. santana.
do you know who i am?
i'm fine.
fine now, thank you.
give me 00 of librium and check it out in two hours.
okay, doctor.
this is exactly the same as the other patients.
after every simple operation, they often go into shock.
is that standard?
do you know what's going on in there?
i know this is a terrible experience for you, but what you need to understand is that there's a pattern here.
he wasn't senile when he got here.
why now?
dementia is a strange thing.
and he will.
that kind of stress can suddenly happen.
i'm sure it'll fix the situation with a nice rest and medication.
what are we gonna do, by the way?
nothing.
what do you mean, "nothing"?
we'll wait for him to answer the drug.
did you tell dad he had cancer?
he has the right to know that.
i don't know exactly what you want from me, mr. tremont.
dr ethridge, dr ethridge, dr ethridge, dr
i don't trust santana.
you're the hospital manager, and all i'm saying is that she's not comforting us.
dr. santana's a fine young surgeon.
apparently, he's being perfect and professional about your father.
i told him he would never tell my father he had cancer, because he's terrified of that word.
but what he did, he went right away and told him.
yeah, it's hard for any doctor to say.
he has to balance the balance in the rights of your father's knowledge with family members.
i'm sure he had no choice.
he had a choice.
he should have listened to me.
i know my father.
why did you tie his arms?
so he wouldn't hurt himself.
he was hitting himself with his hands.
well, i'm his son, and i don't think he needs it.
let us know when you're ready, and we'll put him back in bed.
i can't believe this.
hey, dad, how's it going?
does he always look like this?
look, hey, look, look, i brought annie.
and billy's here.
hey, dad.
how are you feeling, dad?
can you hear me?
hey, grandpa, it's me, billy.
how's it going?
god, john, i can't stand being here when he looks like this.
i think that's enough.
i've given him a privilege.
it'll calm him down.
how long has she been like this?
all the time we've been here.
he seemed depressed?
jesus, doctor.
i'm glad you're not a detective.
yeah, he seemed depressed.
what the hell is going on here?
i mean, is there anything unusual, mr. tremont?
mr. tremont-
don't keep telling me it's normal, doctor.
this extraordinary depression isn't unusual, it's true, but the sedative will bring it to itself.
sedative?
he's hallucinating.
he yells all the time.
he doesn't know any family, and you just gave him a sedative?
why didn't you give him the cake?
maybe his throat hurts too!
we decided to discharge your father tomorrow.
you can pick it up after 00:00.
what do you mean, "cheese"?
you want to tell me dad's cured?
well, of course not, but in medicine, there's nothing we can do for him.
we can't keep the beds in vain for patients we can't help medical.
how do we know?
he didn't get any medical help!
what exactly do you mean?
whatever i said.
so they don't care if he's dead.
what kind of speech is that?
he didn't think-- he didn't
just calm down.
you want my father out of here?
look what i'm gonna do.
i'll do better than you can.
i understand you can't take care of him.
john, what are you doing?
mr. tremont- don't touch him.
that's not necessary.
i'm gonna take him home.
mr. tremont, what you've done is highly irrelevant.
what do we do now?
i don't know.
we don't have a lot of options, but we don't
no, i don't want to do that.
i don't want to take her to a home.
me too, john, but we have to do something.
wait a second, john.
in that case, you can't help him.
i think i can do that.
i'll do better than the hospital can.
i'll stay and help.
no.
why not?
i'll take care of him.
he's my father.
well, he's my grandfather.
i'm your father.
i don't want you here right now, billy.
you shouldn't see this.
father, i'm not a child.
look, i think you should go.
go back to school, go back to mexico.
you're on your way.
don't you get it?
yeah, i see.
i want to talk to him.
i don't think that's a good idea right now, mom, really.
annie's right, mom.
go to the funeral car.
you'd like that, wouldn't you, mario?
i mean, get in the car, mom.
it was just a slip of tongue.
he'll be fine.
john will take care of her.
let's go, dad.
this gooden kid is great, isn't he?
the style reminds me of bob gibson.
you know, he's a real player.
got it, dad?
good.
come on.
madensu.
we're gonna have to work on the technique.
okay.
what you need is a little home cooking.
well, i think you're right.
wait till you taste this.
come on, dad.
okay.
hmm, okay.
here.
try this.
come on, dad, bite a little.
come on, there you go.
let's give it a try.
dad, there's nothing wrong with the glass.
house rules.
you don't like it there, do you?
i don't like it either.
we're gonna be fine, huh?
come on, dad.
that's better.
okay, dad.
hold on a minute and i'll put you to bed.
i'll just put these on and i'll come.
why are we here, ed?
why aren't we at the farm?
what?
you know, if we stay, they'll wonder, you know.
where's the landlord?
it's your house, dad.
what are you talking about?
mandy didn't come back from the meadow, ed.
i'm worried about him.
well, don't worry, dad.
i-i'm sure he's fine.
you think?
it is.
i need 00 nails for the hen, so help me.
it has to be done now.
look.
what we need right now is a good night's sleep.
you don't always say when there's a problem:
"let's lay on it."
i mean, we've got problems right now, dad.
let's go to bed.
dad?
dad?
dad?
dad, where are you?
dad?
dad?
dad?
dad?
what the hell are you doing here?
oh, dad, come on, let me help you.
come on, dad, come on.
no.
dad, i'm going to lift the bed.
come on out.
come on, dad, get out.
dad, come on.
i got you.
shh.
come on.
shh.
i got you, i got you.
i got you.
mr. tremont?
i understand you brought your father back to the hospital.
yeah.
i thought it'd be hard for you to take care of him at home.
that's no place for him right now.
he can't do it at home, he can't do it here, can he?
maybe he'd better go for a chopper on top and stop.
it's difficult for kids to admit their parents are old, i know.
and what that means.
i know what it's like to get old.
mr. tremont, don't forget the doctors are human.
we can't handle all the problems.
we can't save every patient.
we live in a system where old people get hard at last.
what is it you want?
why are you here?
there's another doctor in this hospital.
i think he can do better than dr. santana.
what?
i'm kicking everything they say.
he's a good man.
i want him to take a look at your father.
mr. tremont?
mr. tremont?
how are you, mr. tremont?
let's do a few tets.
let's get an eeg and get a metabolic disorder.
give calcium-magnnesium and we'll run vital functions.
i'm not sure what caused it, but my diagnosis is based on an epilepsy.
the question is, what caused it?
and why isn't she conscious?
if you'd like to have other consultations on this, please do it.
no, that's not necessary.
well, like we said, don't think we're gonna sit around and do nothing.
we don't think so.
so far, we've run a series of tests and we'll do more.
so far, all we've ever done is fire on darkness.
i appreciate your modesty, doctor.
but these tests were done a long time ago, right?
he's gonna be here for a while, so we're gonna watch him from the monitor every minute.
and i'm gonna check and visit him twice a day.
i'm not gonna leave your head until he gets better.
i'm afraid that's completely against hospital rules.
how long can you stand it?
i don't know.
i'm leaving once a day.
i'm sitting.
i'm talking to him.
i'm talking to what happened.
i'm thinking if i sit there and talk, he won't die.
what if he dies?
annie, i don't-- i never--
you're the only one who can't accept it, john.
why don't you let him go?
i can't explain that to you.
maybe i should be there when he ends up.
i don't know.
to prove he's still here.
to prove i was his son.
so what'd you do positive for so far?
annie, this guy's gone to work every day in his life that he never loved.
we never asked him.
he did it because he was the father and he had no choice.
he never asked if i'm happy or happy.
he didn't even know if he had the right.
as a result of this election, we have to look after him and take care of him.
but i messed it up.
john.
i'm embarrassed to him, but my mother has dominated him.
she's getting old right now.
i'm embarrassed because i have a marriage that's bad, and i have a son on the street that i'd barely recognize.
maybe it's gonna be so hard for me, maybe
but i'll be there when you die.
and i'm gonna kiss her, and i'm gonna cover her, and i'm gonna cover her, and i'
and i'm going to paint the gold i'm there.
i owe him that.
when did you get to town?
never been.
i'm staying with some friends.
i didn't want to leave my grandpa.
you come here every day?
when you leave, a nurse calls me.
i'm standing about a half hour.
where am i, johnny?
you're in the hospital, dad.
i can understand that.
why are you here?
or was there an earthquake car accident?
is he talking?
yeah, he's talking.
he's learning like a child.
go, uh, report this to dr. chad.
please, please.
why would she look so nice to me?
oh, he-he's one of the hospitals, dad.
that's a nurse.
this is molly, uh, it's annie.
this is my father.
yes, mr. tremont.
how can we make you feel better?
you can start with those pipe wires on me.
and then i'd better eat something.
are you going to starve me here?
okay, we need to take it easy first.
remember, you haven't eaten for a long time.
maybe that's why i'm like this.
have you thought about it?
all tests positive, vitals stable.
this is a healthy human profile.
i've seen people coming out of a coma before.
we don't usually find out why.
i have some theories about this.
not now.
like what?
however, we've given him the enzymes of the serum mix that we've had last done, and we're lucky to have it.
i see.
you know, when we get home, we'd say it was all this.
but in return, it was your love and interest that brought your father back from where he went.
i think it's better this way.
me too.
they're here.
what's going on, dad?
what are you looking for?
your mother and i are starting a new life together, johnny.
we need new clothes.
i don't know, dad.
what do you think mom would say about all this?
she'll probably laugh at me and call me crazy, but she'll laugh.
we've had a laugh at home for ten years.
how about that?
thank you.
thank you, thank you.
ladies and gentlemen, our show is on.
no matter how drunk you get during your performance, please stay put.
the house is afraid to present the number one star of our show, the late, late man, and almost a funeral, returned from a successful tour of the belly tour, on the blacklisted men, who are almost a corpse, almost a funeral, almost a decaying and a decaying
great jake.
i'd like to give him a big hand.
come on, give it a big round of applause.
we're on.
and he's a friend of his, billy!
ladies and gentlemen, billy!
this is my outfit for a bike on a beach in venice.
maybe it's skating.
this is my baseball-watching outfit.
see?
i think i'm gonna wear this more at home.
in fact, i can go watch some games, but not with these clothes.
that's good to hear, jake.
wait.
there's another one.
do it again.
oh, i peed my pants!
stop them!
i'm dying!
i didn't hear anybody laughing, bette.
but wouldn't that be nice?
i'm telling you, johnny, he's not the same.
maybe his hormones are mixed up with someone else's.
you know what happens in hospitals.
nobody's gonna believe he's a 00-year-old, even though he's about to die a few weeks ago
you have to talk to someone, i mean it.
mom, she's just having fun.
we played one hole, but still...
perfect day.
why don't you take us somewhere after breakfast?
that's a good idea.
maybe mom will come with us.
i don't get in that car he drove.
it used to go a lot faster before.
i hate to think about what he likes right now.
don't worry about your pretty little head, bette.
when old jake tremont is on the wheel, you'll be safe for her to be in your own bed.
and this is gonna be fun.
what are you doing on the ground?
nothing.
i want to see if i still can't pull a push-up.
i call it "old man pushup."
what are you gonna do, bette?
are you coming to the beach?
i'm coming, but only with a cab.
i don't want to go with a cab.
i think we can sail in santa monica.
that's old people's paradise.
every corner either a practice or a bank.
i want to drive to venice.
oh, i used to love fishing.
where are my olta teams?
i think i put them somewhere in the garage.
that was 00 years ago.
i'll go get them.
he'll be fine.
johnny, i'm scared.
he's talking about people i don't even know, or people i'm sure are dead.
he says we live on a farm in cape may in new jersey, and he's taking us there because it's harvest time.
what?
father.
he told you, huh?
what's going on?
why don't you drive me around?
john, i need to talk.
johnny, johnny, johnny, johnny, johnny
...in new jersey cape may, what are the chances that i'm living on a farm with your mother and four children?
i don't think you have a chance, dad.
isn't there a chance the k-kid can be on a small farm?
don't i have four kids there?
you, annie, hank and little lizbeth?
as far as i know, father, you've been living in los angeles for 00 years.
you had a regular job until you retired from locheed.
before that, we lived in the placefield and you worked for lockeheed there.
i know you're right.
i mean, how can you be in two places at the same time?
i mean, my life there's just like this, like this, right here, like this, right here, right here,
i'm just sitting there watching the ocean.
if this is too technical or too fantastic, stop to me.
your father, laing, as laing described, "sign schizophrenic".
over the years, he's not enjoying his everyday life long enough, and he's isolating everything he's enjoying, by turning it into a fantasy.
he's created more life than he wanted.
how long has this been going on?
it's hard to say now.
at least 00 years, maybe more.
unbelievable.
you see, in order to achieve that, you have to have an extremely intelligent, strong-willed, emotional personality.
and where's my mother's in all this?
he was thrown out of these?
you're frozen in time.
your mother's very helpful, very sweet.
isn't that the most important thing in the world?
he has influence.
the problem is that your father's in this world depends on your mother's approval.
ever since he's defeated himself, he's been a happy person.
the walls that separate his two worlds were destroyed.
and he's brought the fun he's kept from his life for years into his diary.
if your mother doesn't agree with him, she'll just disappear and walk away.
hi, all the good people here.
maybe i'll do some jogging on the bike path.
what do people think if they see you like this?
who cares?
i don't want people calling us old farts.
and don't care what people think anymore.
don't let some young people see what we're wearing.
i'm coming with you, dad.
good boy, good boy.
don't worry about me.
i'm gonna go to newark and get some things for the farm.
hey, mom, i told you what the doctor said.
you need to help him now.
that kind of comment won't solve anything.
the man lives in another time zone.
you have to show him that.
that's all.
i explained to you, it's just a dream.
it's a well-made and wonderful dream world.
dad's learning how to tell two worlds right now.
he's trying.
i don't care what you say.
something happened to him.
this man is not your father.
i think it's the real jake tremont.
the guy's been hiding it for 00 years.
hi.
i'm jake tremont, this is bette tremont.
we're your neighbors across the street.
of course.
how can i help you?
okay.
this is christopher.
how's it going, young man?
and say hello to mr. tremont, chris.
hi.
hi.
if you're looking for someone to take care of a child, we're always home.
oh, you're very kind.
thank you.
no, no, no, it's a lying dog.
there he is.
he's like a lying dog.
yeah.
yeah, he's... he's too fast.
go... go... go... go... go
maybe we're-- maybe we
we wanted to say hello.
we brought you some brownies.
come in.
maybe he's out scratching.
did you hear any weird noises last night?
why, did you hear that?
i think i heard something.
i think it should be the wind.
close the door." close the door."
they'll come in the wind."
how's it going with dad?
the doctor thinks it's reformation.
he's trying to get into my bed at night.
she's not leaving me alone.
your father was always a sexy man, but he's been crazy since he came back from new jersey.
when we first got married, i told my friend fanny hogan the things we did with your father, and he told me to leave him and not to the police.
when i confessed with the priest, he said he'd pray for me.
but it didn't work.
you know, when your father is warned, police, priests, prayers, nothing can stop him.
oh, grow up.
"i'm a small, short, fat little teapot."
"here's my pervert at work my mouth"
"when it comes out of my face"
"you'll hear my shit."
"take me down and spill my guts!"
oh, bingo.
here.
you know, i realized something.
we don't speak japanese.
you just realized that?
we should try to get to know a new country once a week.
we just have to eat the country's food and talk about the language.
we have to do this.
no, we shouldn't.
where's the train station?"
where's the train station?"
what are you doing?
i'm trying to find the train station.
i think that's a good idea.
it's working.
i feel like japanese.
oh, yeah, annie, give us some samples, please.
clothes, huh?
"the clothes of japanese women...
"it's quite different than the men's.
"it's like a bunch of peasant women, like their husbands in a
"and they wear pants and trenchcoats.
"that's someone who's new there, too,
it's hard for people to recognise the sexes of humans because there's no chance of beards."
i don't know about you, but i don't want to be in a country where i can't isolate people's gender.
i'm serious.
this happened to me in a bar once before.
john, you tell us about agriculture.
"in the country of these mountains, the earth's only 00% of the country can be committed."
pass the rice, please.
if you say that in japanese.
"give me the bat, please."
you're welcome.
come on, mom.
you live with it.
no.
no.
no.
billy, you-you go ahead.
traditional japanese sports.
what have you got for us?
"umo wrestler, put on a sumo suit...
they have to gain 000 pounds of heavy weight before they repent."
that's a big idea.
get him as fat as you can, then put him in a diaper.
john, don't you think these types are interesting?
mario, i'm starting to worry about you.
honey, please tell me...
wait a minute.
extend, stretch, stretch... stretch, stretch
what do you want?
what about fish?
you want that too?
here.
no, i don't, jake.
i don't eat that.
i don't want to know japanese.
i don't want to know the neighbors' children.
mom, please shut up...
i wanted to walk, but now i know what i have.
but since you got back from the hospital, this place has turned into a madhouse.
costumes, jogging, sex for hours.
and a farm in new jersey!
i'm telling you, this man can't even be left alone on the street.
dad's really good.
he just wants to have fun!
i didn't live my life to end this way!
a crazy man like my old friend!
you know that better.
the doctor said he's not crazy!
the truth is, he's been under your raid for 00 years!
oh, come on.
please don't.
don't tell your mother such things.
please.
we're family.
let's trust each other.
everyone love each other and let's forget.
and please don't fight.
it kills me to talk like that.
why?
why are you doing this?
you're gonna bring him back to his old self again.
it can't be what you want.
i want my husband back.
he wants his life back.
he loved you for 00 years.
can't you just leave him alone?
i'm scared, jake.
i don't know who you are.
i don't know you.
i know.
look at me or... see the old man who looks at me and sees me.
but inside, thank god, bette, i feel like i'm 00.
and i guess i do, too.
your other life, jake, he's giving it to you.
what's so bad for me?
we crossed the border a bit.
a little.
are you asking me to go back to our old life?
oh, no.
i'm asking you if we should return to what we want.
you were good.
not just to me, to the world... to the world...
we used to have a good time, remember?
we used to dance all the time.
you were a pretty good dancer.
and i'd love to dance with you one last time before i die.
don't talk about death.
dying is not a sin.
life is too.
good morning, mom.
good morning.
nice outfit.
your father likes it.
mr. tremont?
i have some news.
not very good.
what is it?
well, it's not the same in every case, but it looks, uh...
okay, good doctor, you can tell me the truth.
cancer's back.
it's spreading.
he's mixed up in lymph glands.
how much?
it's hard to say.
every patient looks different.
doctor chad?
i don't know.
hey, dad, what are you doing at this hour?
i'm waiting for you.
why?
you understand your mother and i were divorced when you were too young to come home late.
as a father, i think i've lost my sense of concern for my son.
you want me to go out and come back?
no, let's just sit down and talk.
what do you want to talk about?
i'll try to tell you something.
as your father, i'd like to give you some advice.
some predictions.
i can't think of anything.
it might be hard for someone your age to understand someone my age.
you know, every time we meet, we're always on the move.
you go, i come, or we're in someone's wedding.
all we're talking about is bags and little sandwiches we can eat.
i don't know much about you.
well, i'm, uh, i'm, uh, i'm, u
i love sports, i like bikes-- bikes-
you know, we always do the same thing.
we'll come up to you, one thing... to say something real... then one of us makes a joke.
talk to me.
tell me about mexico.
i love it there.
oh, there people are sincere and understanding.
well, that's where life goes in a rhythm.
you got a lot of friends there?
yeah, there are five of us.
you know, we hang out as a group.
we work together.
we share everything we do.
we share cleaning, homework.
we're a real family.
other men from school?
well, two of them are girls.
life has changed, billy.
it's hard to believe you've changed your life.
why is the money coming before your mom and me?
oh.
you said you wanted to talk.
okay.
because, uh, this is about what a man was before.
some father wears a suit and makes good money.
okay, that's the easy one.
because i love the power of it.
it's nice to be someone... who's good at the job, everyone's running at him.
and something should have been given, and this was my family.
well, i never did that.
i never got away from my family.
running away was the hardest thing for me.
that didn't look like it.
i mean, because we wanted to be normal.
that's what it says in books.
normal divorce.
but it did.
a little.
it still hurts.
i missed you, billy.
and you never needed me around you.
but i like staying in your life.
i'm your father.
i have an advice for you.
someone i feel owed something to.
and what?
forgiveness.
he slept a little.
were you here all afternoon?
he feels better when i'm here.
let's go downstairs and get something to eat.
the doctor will be here soon.
i don't want to kidnap him.
i'll catch up with you.
come on.
where's mom?
billy and i went down for dinner.
oh, good.
how are you feeling?
excellent.
i can say good.
you know what i think?
what?
yankees-dodgers games.
what?
i'm trying, but all i can think of is old games and old knees.
bonanza.
oh, that's great, dad.
what about the yankees-dodgers games?
who took it?
this is the biggest event in baseball history.
the yankee players are joe dimaggio, the prince of players, stardar, stodger left field, and dodger left field player, dodger.
al gionfriddo, second row player.
he's just the left wing player... he's just
carl furillo played because he was crippled.
you know this story?
tell me.
well, in the sixth game, the submersibles were 0-0 dodgers in the lead.
two people in, two out.
top dimaggio.
he threw the ball in the left wing, made the most famous run by history.
everyone there knew that.
but that little man gionfriddo showed up.
he ran after the ball.
but joe dimaggio didn't know he shot the ball.
at the last moment, he jumped.
he lived forever.
but the big deal came up.
dimaggio started on his second tour run, and he saw gionfriddo catch the ball.
he's really upset, he kicked the mud.
you like this?
this man who would never reveal his emotions, he was a man of many.
it was al gionfriddo who uncovered his emotions.
you know what that means to me?
what?
in america, anything is possible if you do your job well.
sometimes when you were a kid, i'd like to take care of you more.
i'd love to kiss you more.
you did it, dad, you did it.
do you know how much i love you?
yeah.
a lot has happened, johnny.
sometimes good, sometimes bad.
honey, i'm putting these in the car.
okay.
did you talk to mom?
mom's gonna stay here for now.
until next month.
we'll see about that later.
okay.
i think he'll be fine.
how you holding up?
i miss him.
yeah, me too.
go ahead, i'll catch up with you.
one moment, please.
you go.
hmm... hmm... hmm...
grandpa, we just wanted to say goodbye before we go.
well, and we've decided this is the right place to do it.
because there's so much going on here than you.
you have something that lives and grows.
when i think about you...
that was fun.
yeah.
grandpa, i love you, and i'll always miss you.
my father and i are here together.
that's good.
that's a good idea.
i feel better.
me too.
the tobacco and they say it's a mix of black trash that brings the vision and invites the demons.
he used to look at me like he was trying to expose a mystery.
the turkish came to florence.
but from this year's political events, it's not going to be the same invalid parade.
as long as there's traditional commercial rules, we'll pay half now and half when it's done.
tell me, is there anything else you're afraid of?
please don't help them in their effort.
but to tell you the truth, i've designed a more contradictive device i know you'll be interested in your high intelligence.
speaking of materialism, a two-headed ice cap died on zitto's farm.
the last cadaver you brought was rotting when i opened it with a knife.
a card can show its destiny, not just a person's nature.
it represents sacrifice.
i must introduce myself as a military engineer, not a painter.
why don't night guards give that man a break?
the man's sword was so loose and now he finds himself looking at this beautiful sword.
because if you'd asked people, they'd say i've been able to use both my hands very well, and i've been able to fight very, very, very, very comfortably with both hands... and very
you've made a very serious mistake tonight, artkar.
but i'm staying at the black swan's hospital.
see me before i go, maestro.
what did he give you?
same ass, different faces, and when i realized it, i took a sip of his tit.
i'm not gonna let you ruin our family's last name with your flight movements and your simple attempts to sell yourself.
as much as i want to deny you, our dignity is connected.
my wife, margherita gave me a boy last week.
my legal heir.
i wonder how long it'll take him to curse his bloodline.
you're a good man.
by men who know how to shoot.
this is what you've accomplished, leonardo.
they're executing a jew today.
she's definitely a charming woman, but i'd rather put that dentist witch on the bed.
please give me something to drink from the memory fountain.
depends what's in it.
history is a lie made into weapons by people who suppress the truth.
after centuries, your story will be repressed too.
have you ever heard of "life is like a river"?
this so-called unpredictable thing is that the river is circulation.
one person's death opens the door to the birth of another.
i saw a man executed today.
please give me something to drink from the memory fountain.
this temple was a place for a temple used in a long before christ.
we are known as the sons of mithra.
what many of you once said was the process... is the reminder of what was forgotten.
lately, some clues have shown me things that will make the book's location.
when abraham ben yusuf was captured and sent to death, he was following those clues.
maybe you heard about the secret archive vatican collected.
he's a man named lupo mercuri.
i still don't understand what this has to do with me.
taken from constantinople against his will.
do you remember when you were a kid that happened?
i was a kid in vinci.
i was sent to get the lost lamb.
what am i supposed to do until then?
fate has chosen you, leonardo.
i don't believe in destiny.
then believe in yourself.
so where do i start looking?
the hanged man, from the depth of the soul.
he's already opened the door for you.
what about mom?
he'll be waiting for you on the other side.
all you have to do is walk through the door.
master!
we've been looking for you since last night.
it's been empty for centuries, leo.
master, the night guard was looking for you.
they said lorenzo medici wanted you in person.
leonardo di ser piero...
they said it was my notary's son.
and it was also said that you were very untalented and insufficient in keeping your ideas to yourself.
arrogance means i exaggerate my own worth.
my mistress, lucrezia, apparently, thinks you've got a talent that doesn't have a badger scratch.
he insisted that his beauty could only be in your picture.
he must be very careful, then.
it's called a character flaw.
you have to be smart enough to finish this job.
when it comes to miss donati, it's the last thing i'm afraid of to be bored.
then i'll tell your father to get him a contract.
i have some designs i think you might be interested in.
this will increase your gunner's ignition rate at most.
when the top is fired, the part below it will be filled with balls, and the part below that will cool off.
and the balls are kneeled in a ventilation--
propulsion will be two men inside.
they're gonna control the magnet so they can turn the wheels around.
and the balls can be placed in division around the car.
it's a flying machine.
it's modeled from the wing of a bat.
they were born with wings, yeah.
i believe that people can fly, and i assume god has blessed us by giving us brains that can imagine.
anything that can be imagined can finally be done.
whoever said otherwise is a fool.
what exactly do you suggest?
i'm hoping to be hired as an army engineer.
i'm a doctor, da vinci.
i had nothing to do with making war.
and rome.
as needed, both governments formed alliance with other states.
sforza's death was the end of the game board.
you need your own weapons, sir.
i'll give you a modest salary.
your machinery can be done in reality to see what these are.
shall we say 000 florins then?
if you negotiate more, i'll cut your tongue out.
as you say, sir.
thank you.
you used lucreia to get to me, didn't you?
i would benefit from anything i could to reach my targets.
clever, but i'd advise you not to be too clever around me.
is something wrong?
no, sir.
florence has no secrets.
what kind of demon have you done this time?
he played with a woman's pride.
then back to work.
we have a colombina to do!
i want you to take out the body of a hanged jew.
i need to examine it.
that's what i do?
the body's restrained for a refreshment.
i'll get to work then.
the pazzi family is coming.
he's with the plotter francesco and old man jacopo.
as is our right.
they were given to our ancestor because of their first crusade.
colombina's about to fly.
welcome to god's house, all of you.
the flames of the phoenix suit you well.
tell me the truth, have you always been so desirable with the hookers you've been sleeping with?
you're not a whore, ma'am.
there's no point in this game any longer, ms. donati.
i knew it was you from the moment you approached me.
how did you know?
i drew you.
your faces, your positions, your movement.
the more remarkable question is why a noble woman would risk her reputation for a degenerative artifact.
isn't that what the carnival is about?
tell me what it is.
you knew i'd call you.
lorenzo really liked his designs.
can i see some of your miracles?
what's this?
it's a device to slow one's down rate.
and under what circumstances can i use it?
let's say you're trapped in a castle.
you'll be able to upload it and wipe free in the air safely.
thank god.
lorenzo's interest in you is clearly right.
you've risked more.
maybe your life.
and what do you depend on my reckless attitude for?
i'm forbidden fruit, and think that your fate is scratched.
you're the third person on this week to tell me something about fate.
maybe you're just beginning to hear what they call you.
now... now... now... now...
fuck me again, leonardo.
this time, remember, you're not the only one who can manipulate.
we can't let you through the front door for obvious reasons.
how rude of me.
i promised to pay first.
i accept you're satisfied?
start talking, then.
there's a new player on stage.
an artist known as leonardo da vinci.
the medicis recruited him to build a siege weapon.
the art is the clowns of families.
i don't know why that would concern us.
this artist is different.
my spy in florence.
if i'm not mistaken, you're lupo mercuri.
head of the secret archives.
looks like the turkish found himself a new champion.
keep watching him.
see if he's cooperating.
what if he's not?
then da vinci will burn with pain in hell.
with god's other enemies.
don't harden it.
yeah, you too.
in a good defense, you have to be on the line of attack.
when the bad guy comes on you, you cross the line and create a new line.
until he grows old or you save me?
angel, i didn't ask you to teach me how to punch holes.
i want to learn to fight.
you don't believe i'm gonna do this.
men aren't always around to protect women.
besides, what if you were the man i had to fight?
this could be it.
okay.
force him to stand up and he'll increase his own speed.
cordelia, using a deadly weapon is a little different than shaking a cheerleader.
ready!
ok!
you're on the team.
lilah.
i was just keeping billy company.
thank you so much, gavin.
i'll take it from here.
he felt trapped.
gavin, why don't you go deal with the deals?
you don't want to wake up in such a horrible place again, do you?
nobody wants that.
congressman.
i hope you're out of trouble this time.
let's go home.
this is the second time you've brought our niece back to us.
it was our pleasure.
"happy for us" means he had nothing to do with it.
good boy.
by the way, get out.
why don't you try listening for once instead of opening your big mouth all the time?
you weren't captain of the debate team, were you?
at least lindsey... at least lindsey... well... at least
what you're trying to teach you is the responsibility you took.
i'm so proud of you.
never hurt to be ready.
if you think he can help you fight, why not?
i was kidding.
wesley, if you want to get to know fred better, maybe next time you've got the chance of not wanting us to come to dinner.
so i...
that obvious?
i don't think anybody else noticed.
still, the last thing any of us have to do is be with each other.
office love, even under normal circumstances...
we don't live under normal circumstances.
what are the chances of us finding someone out there who might be able to deal with what we have to deal with?
i don't know, maybe we should... think...
with each other?
i was actually gonna say be alone.
wesley, tell her if you like her.
this murder was committed a week ago.
why are they showing it to me now?
how did you get these?
the police sold you these?
usually, if the victim's important, they sell it.
she said she didn't listen to him.
he was trying to get her to shut up.
actually, it worked.
look who was there 00 minutes before the crime occurred.
what?
okay, nice guy.
and who is it?
are you sure it's him?
when you pull out one of the dimensions of hell, you remember his face.
yeah, that's him.
now we know why the powers showed me the woman's death.
she died because of me.
angel, if he's responsible for this, then so am i.
angel... angel... angel... angel...
hey.
whatever it is, you're not responsible for it, and i'm not.
but i know who you are.
you're a little nervous, lilah.
it was a long day at the office.
it's been brought to my attention.
i was gonna do it.
i know, don't do that with some of his powers... some of his
billy certainly didn't touch me, and you can't touch him.
this family is the most important family in the country.
they have half the east coast.
the law won't do anything to them.
it's not like you're chasing some monsters.
stay away from my client.
i don't think it'd be good to ring the bell.
how about sneaking in, dressing up like the security guys?
all right, you wanna be next?
i say we wait here.
why didn't it surprise me that i could get in without being invited?
as far as i know, you've got a regular invitation.
i've never hurt a woman in my whole life.
i just like to watch.
you're coming back.
really?
you're looking for me.
we're taking you into custody for interrogation.
sanchez, read him his rights.
who are you?
nobody.
i'll tell you my trouble, there's a woman who never listens to me.
yeah, dropping off $00 million from a fortune and running to a prison cell.
yeah, but for how long?
if there's nothing wrong with a cube burning in an insufficiently burning cube of hellfire in a demon dimension, my guess is that there's nothing wrong with him.
angel, what are you gonna do?
you can't just walk into a police station and play the terminator.
there's been an accident.
he can tell us what billy did to her partner before he attacked her.
it's not a bad idea for one of us to wait for a patient in a hospital.
that's part of the blood in the car.
not human.
he came right here.
i'll take a sample to the hotel, see what kind of creature billy has.
i'll take care of a footwork.
normal, everyday errand.
cordelia.
i don't think you should do this.
how could i not?
i managed to get a sample of billy's blood.
we can confirm what demon bloodline it is, and maybe we can figure out how his power works.
hand me the glass plates.
thank you.
will you invite me in?
please, come in.
i want you to tell me about billy.
tell angel everything you didn't tell him.
what makes you think i'm gonna do that?
first of all, it's your face.
i'll know right away from the re-educated wheel.
i don't switch sides with adversity.
angel feels responsible for this kid because he brought him back from hell.
i feel responsible, too, because he did it to save me.
actually, you're responsible for all this, and you don't feel anything because you're a dirty bitch.
his heel is expanding.
pink, this spring isn't fashionable.
billy blim is driving people crazy.
then why didn't he impress angel?
others can take hours.
god, i hope angel doesn't start feeling nervous.
you really haven't.
i have to find billy.
and i'm gonna help you, why?
remember the man you hired to come into my visions?
you know what he did to me, what he looked like?
i was cut, torn up, my face disfigured, and i'm hurt in pain every second, or worse until i die.
it's about pain.
there's definitely nothing you can do to stop it.
that your life could be destroyed by someone else.
and a woman who's strong enough, she's never gonna put on the "dirtless bitch" cover.
where's billy?
i'm a 00-year cab driver, and i understand why you did it.
there's a reason, am i right?
how many times do you want to talk to your clients with fists?
surprised you?
he probably said he'd probably sit back and tell him how to drive.
you know the type.
he probably deserved it.
like i said...
dylan, your cousin's here.
hey, dylan.
billy.
i didn't know you were throwing a party.
i thought we agreed you weren't coming here anymore after what happened.
do you want me to do it or do you?
some of the red blood cells look like they're overpowering.
they're probably showing billy from the demon line.
then billy's power to drive people crazy seems to be in his blood.
which means it could have been through the sweat or spit and even touch it.
speaking of spit, where's cordelia?
when you said, "i think she went out," you knew she was out because you talked to her.
well, i thought i...
if you lie to me again, there'll be a serious problem between us.
sit down, fred.
there's something we need to talk about.
i'm sorry i didn't say cordelia left.
we still have to make some changes around here.
change can be good, i think.
it's like you don't wear the exciting clothes anymore.
provocative?
maybe your parents never told you what men and your parents went after.
you can't just come in here all the time and wave like that on my face.
you're really pushing me to get it.
is that what you want?
stop it.
are we standing up now?
you put your hair back and wink your eyes, and then when we turn around, you laugh at us.
you think you can do anything you want because you're connected to your life?
no.
i'll show you the blood.
what do you say to a woman with two black eyes?
nothing you've said twice already.
no sense of humor.
to be honest, i'm calling to kill that bastard.
come in.
you need to know the rules about billy.
everyone in the family knows these rules.
don't leave your girl alone, keep her pet away from her and never let her touch you.
when you want money, you put it on the table and walk away.
can you explain something to me?
why did you invite me in after you said i wanted to kill your cousin?
you're angel, right?
did billy mention me?
he said someone named angel would come here sooner or later.
the melodrama is exaggerated...
fred.
i know what you're doing.
who you are.
you're pulling me.
you're forcing me to find you.
it's like a cat-fat game.
you're fooling me with ways of girls.
but you never give up, do you?
no, you just keep laughing and running.
guess i'm not one of the new beginnings students.
i'm a man.
you can't show up, can you?
no, you hide.
you cheat.
and you, snake, plotting behind us.
"here, honey, eat this.
just an apple."
the problem is your sex.
why are you making me do this?
do i know you?
i thought we should meet.
i'm the woman that wolfram and hart tortured to get you out of your cell.
i see.
poor, helpless, crushed woman needs to throw all the injustices out of him.
no, asshole.
i'm here to send you back.
i mean, of course, you're whores who sell themselves for money and prestige, but men are so bad.
maybe even worse.
they're willing to spend their careers, their families, even their lives for what's under your skirt.
i'm wearing pants.
in fact, i'm superior because i have an arrow aiming for the jugular.
and is it a coincidence that i used a penis-shaped weapon?
i don't think so.
you don't have the guts to do this.
you were wrong again.
he can't hurt me.
no, i'm not gonna hurt her.
i'm not gonna hurt him at all.
here.
i can tell you that billy's blood on his handprints was on the wound.
so the handprint on the fingerprint downstairs is billy's blood?
you're saying wes turned into a crazy killer because of the handprint i'm looking at?
that worries me when you put it that way.
i'd better get out of here.
lock the door behind me.
maybe we should run plan b.
god.
you said we should run plan b, but what's plan b?
plan b... plan b... plan b...
plan b... plan b... plan b...
plan b, if you don't stop talking, you're gonna punch you...
god.
cordy, get out of here.
all that rage, all the hatred, all the hatred that you've got to go up to the surface.
please go.
i can't.
that's my problem, too.
you think that's your problem?
you know what your real problem is?
men like this!
because your power doesn't affect me.
charles, you're scaring me.
take this and put me down.
you want me to hit you?
yes!
i can't.
you can.
hit me!
charles, please.
"charles, please." good.
you'll pay for this.
would you like to hear my theory, fred?
about how stupid you are.
after five years of living in a cave, i believe that if you're running out of nowhere to be safe, you'll be instinctively little, dark places.
let's get this over with.
i'm sorry, wesley.
are you sorry?
you were right about me liking dark places to hide.
but you also forgot i like to improve things.
i don't either.
i mean, you're a man, but why didn't billy's touch affect you?
maybe it's because i'm not human.
and a vampire can never turn into a monster.
you know that thing that billy brings out to other people?
it was always about pain and pleasure.
i suppose you could say the devil's direction makes you less important than people.
like a noble man.
i mean, it's really annoying to be inclined to evil.
strange.
what?
i'm getting used to fighting outside, and i'm relieved.
i understand that.
wesley, it's me, fred.
does it hurt?
i left you a lot of messages.
i'm so sorry.
wesley, you have to go back to work.
how can you not?
but it's time to go back.
fred.
something inside me was forced to surface.
god, no.
it was nothing in you, wesley.
it was something that happened to you.
i don't know what kind of man i am anymore.
i know.
you're a good man.
will i see you back at the office?
yeah.
good.
why would he risk everything to escape the tender arms?
tomorrow we walk to rome with crixus.
but i want you to go with spartacus.
we're having a bunny?
bring your torch over here!
his orders are known by the bull's mark.
and the eagle.
the mark of gaeus pompeius magnus.
i thought pompey was banging the renegade tougorius in the ham.
if pompey's scouts return to the republic, he and his legions will follow their trail.
let me know if you see any movement on the sides.
then we have to support the ghost and get the flesh to the bone and see light days.
was the end as he always dreamed?
the days after we parted were full of victory.
our enemy's blood has been turning the roads into dead, red-hot land.
did he have the same fate as crixus?
to show spartacus the end of his life.
crassus tempts to tempt you to be a fool.
if i was just a matter of my own life, maybe i'd be trapped.
he was heading south, towards the legion of crassus.
order apollo to leave the camp at the speed of the sky.
a whore named canthara was beaten and found stabbed from his womb to his throat.
i'm very surprised by that offer.
i don't know that pompey is supportive of a case that doesn't help himself.
if he had a desire like that, why didn't he do it himself?
i won't risk going to the commander's camp.
i'm not leaving my duty to salute in front of a imaginary titan.
you can't really be planning on accepting this offer.
pompey wants to know what he knows about spartacus to steal victory from what he deserves.
and when the time comes, we can get revenge for the injured.
let's get to ourselves with the theme of the living hot bones.
and to console the survivors of death, of course.
every drop of roman blood spilled on the honor of our taken!
i've got professor charles eppes with me right now, a catsci who's often consulting for the fbi.
are you here to help the fbi find bonnie parks?
for example, we know mrs. parks's car was in san marino mall.
yeah, i've calculated 00 agencies with a reason for revenge.
yeah, that's true, but every suspect is a different degree of impulse.
you know, there's a circus game where you put a pistol in the clown's mouth to fill the balloon.
the asymmetric threat assessment allows us to measure the factor that feeds impulses in each suspect, like the mechanism that calculates water flowing through every clown's mouth.
we need to find out if the unsub feeds enough to detonate.
especially those who are afraid of him, the ones he intimidates.
the filter pump's been making a lot of noise lately.
hi, charlie.
your father mentioned trouble the other day after class, and i volunteer.
go on a long run, do a favor for the planet.
during his research, it's a closed box.
he used to work on his own until the shoot.
i was in the same dorm in afghanistan with some people.
he doesn't trust his security.
i'll go myself.
the lab team figured out the notes we found in her office.
your wife, your ex-wife, your angry boyfriend.
yeah, i'm on my way right now.
charlie, who might have tried to do this to you?
because you were so angry about my interview.
what happened shouldn't change anything.
it was december.
can we discuss this in the room, not here?
help you.
and you know you sacrificed a lot to make her do something big.
when i was 00, i started here swinging a hammer.
it's making taylor look like a great hero to buy a bruise-ass income center.
she's been talking to the losers who've been forced out of their homes in order to make room for the site and usually talk to the losers that taylor's thugs scared.
i'm still working on it.
that's the problem that i need to analyze and know what i'm not doing.
i told your father i'd give you a shot.
and how cute is it to see the power meter back?
it is, isn't it?
i don't know how long it'll last.
now that you're back, you're either very brave or your brain is small.
i got sonny layva.
when i find bonnie, she'll mark sonny.
there's no way sonny could have kidnapped a man on his own.
when i was being held on that freighter, when they cuffed me in handcuffs, there was something that made me stand in needles.
and he knew my team would come for me.
no matter how bad it was, you and david, you were working with megan and don, and you were going through that door.
because i had the same thing when i first saw a war in afghanistan.
yeah, ten-digit property numbers, square footage, plus numbers, all that's been concealed.
if you apply force to a particular buoy, pull it down, you pull it down, and that shaman in his neighbour, a force pulling them down.
and the neighbors, the neighbors, they help lift the float.
basically, it was hard enough to sink the whole float line into the water.
he'd make millions by buying those properties.
hundreds of millions, probably.
we never know.
and so is that.
it's nothing but a personal feud.
it's not just walls and roof tiles.
and all that master architect's spirit was a belief that beauty and practicality are the same.
behind you.
i mean, do you think i'm your toilet?
you know, being better.
what exactly do you do?
nobody likes french.
we've lost contact with our scouts.
but based on the analysis of the condition of the disease, we know that that's where the microchup began to procreate.
we don't know that until we see an example.
you're gonna go there under special forces, find any survivors, and you're gonna find a blood sample from the resurrected dead, but the navy missiles are going to destroy the entire area at 0000.
i don't have to tell you what's gonna happen if 00 minutes gets the story.
what's that smell?
we did it.
the attempt to stop the dead has been neutralized.
mom!
megan.
you can't fly, baby.
mom!
mr. edick.
what are you doing here?
we need to talk, janet.
can't we do it another time?
to take care of my daughter... my daughter.
you're not answering my phone.
that's why i came to see you.
no flying.
how can you find me in the middle of san francisco and not find my husband?
your husband doesn't want to be found.
i told you that.
yeah, i said i'd give you everything i can.
that's not how it works, janet.
maybe it's because my husband paid you.
understand?
yeah.
megan?
megan?
megan?
megan?
megan, answer me!
mom?
mom?
mom?
megan.
megan?
hello?
please!
please.
i just want to see my little girl.
please.
please.
at least tell me if you're okay.
no nails.
help!
somebody help me!
please.
can you hear me?
i know you're there.
okay.
stay back!
control yourself!
i'm not gonna hurt you.
i'm here to help.
who are you?
my name's joe.
okay?
i'm not one of them.
i don't know.
i woke up five minutes ago.
how did you get out of your room?
there was a key.
you don't have a key?
calm down.
do you know why you're here?
why would someone do that?
i owed some people something.
how much?
about $0,000.
it doesn't seem worth the trouble.
anyone else?
my husband.
what does your husband want from me?
where are we?
i don't know.
what's the last thing you remember?
i was in the park and... and... and... and i
where?
san francisco.
i was in new york.
let me see.
i'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
suck your blood.
i think i heard someone else's voice.
yeah, me too.
we have to find them.
yeah?
yeah.
what's the matter?
what if it's the people that kidnapped us?
what difference does it make?
we'll let them go.
of course i can leave you.
hello?
can anyone hear me?
hello?
sound!
what the hell is this place?
take me out, for god's sake!
listen to me.
okay, there's a bible in the dresser.
and a key in the bible.
look at the bible in the drawer next to your bed.
charlie morse.
capital investor.
i'm joe.
not yet.
if they want money, i have it.
we're still trying to figure out who they are.
can you help me?
didn't i hear the wake-up call?
easy, easy!
calm down, soldier.
we're on your side.
you're a hostage too?
yeah.
we're all hostages.
it's okay.
i didn't think i drank that much.
are you okay?
i think my standards are slipped.
do you know where he is?
you know what?
i think i should make a call.
come.
where are the people who took us?
i'm not waiting to find out.
it's not working.
why don't they come and get us?
i don't understand.
that's the way you behave, sir!
you must spend your strength balanced.
sorry.
sorry.
i just... just... me just... me
my wife.
if i don't look at her... if i don't
i don't even want to think about what's gonna happ
smoke detector.
if the alarm works, the magnets can shut down.
what do you say?
i'm saying if we can light a fire, maybe we can get out of here.
but if the doors don't open, we're stuck here.
anybody got a match?
break as little as you can.
splinters.
this is bullshit.
i want him to jump out of nowhere and stick it in his throat.
renbe, i can't wait to find out.
i need more confirmation.
is this who i think it is?
better.
see this?
someone who disappeared in a playground yesterday.
it's too small to be interested.
it was a mother they kidnapped.
they didn't touch the kid.
a mother who left her child.
no, single mom.
good mother.
she was at home looking for children.
that's... that's... that'
if that happens, he could be in san francisco anyway.
i found a video.
of course you did.
i'm not talking to conclusions, kat.
the cops don't ignore evidence like they used to.
security camera got everything.
the web trees can't take it for a couple of hours.
uncertain.
unpredictable.
it's just something that's hoping for nothing.
anybody ask about her?
she's got a grandmother, but...
you're looking at me.
i'm looking at you.
your mum's gonna end up in a body bag, mark.
you know that.
give me your transvestite first.
then you can check the missing mom thing.
i can't see anything.
everybody think.
what was the last thing you remember?
last night, i went to sleep like every night, and then i woke up here.
who could have done this?
what are you worth?
worth it?
i'm meditating in difficult situations for the student body.
i make $00,000.
i have $00,000 in retirement money.
you soldier?
the army doesn't pay much, sir.
what about you?
i'm not worth anything to anyone but me.
maybe, maybe not.
why do you think they kidnapped you?
i'd rather not.
what do you do?
no offense, but i don't know who you are.
we're sitting here thinking about where the bad guys are.
how do we know the bad guys aren't here?
he's right.
one of us could be one of them.
but there's only one joe that we don't know anything about.
everyone has value in someone's eyes.
i don't have money, i don't have a family.
i'm not worth anything to anyone.
maybe life is the insurance.
no.
it's the only reason i know for someone to be kidnapped.
not everyone's kidnapped for money.
right, sergeant?
are you saying someone's gonna cut our heads off?
it's hard to do if we move.
come on, come on.
there you go.
somebody get that table over there.
here.
come on.
move!
move!
are you coming?
what is this?
a hotel.
chinese food?
someone's here.
hello?
cut.
hello?
all lines are cut.
i don't understand.
no sheriff's office?
i wonder who's watching us.
i wish they'd come and get us.
it's much worse.
we have a few hours before dark.
shall we walk?
until someone stops us.
is that a weapons locker?
nobody move!
what?
what do you want us to do?
get down, okay?
do what he says.
get down!
which one of you is in charge?
you don't have the authority?
you're not one of them, are you?
so you're not one of them.
i don't even know who they are, okay?
listen.
we were kidnapped like you.
i don't know about that.
get down, okay?
i won't say it again!
if you want to shoot me, go ahead.
i have nothing to lose.
okay?
get the gun!
get the gun!
get the gun!
keep him down.
okay, okay.
i won't stop squeezing until i get some answers.
what's your name?
how do we get out of here?
i don't know.
red lights, whatever.
i woke up in that hotel over there.
it was you.
i heard you walked past my room.
did you ask for help?
so you're saying you left him?
look, no offense.
enough.
so what do we do with him?
does it matter?
he could be one of them.
okay.
who's coming with me?
me.
what else?
we don't know what's out there.
so, what, we stay here?
i'm just saying we should be discreet.
wait till dark.
then i'll take the rifle and i'll find out.
what if you get caught in the dark?
i'm willing to risk it.
well, that's your job, isn't it?
but then, you'll be dead with the only rifle we have.
if that's what you think... if that's what you
i'm not waiting for the dark.
eve, i'm leaving right now.
you can stay here and take care of others.
who authorized that?
you did.
if i'm not back by tomorrow, you'll discover your discovery.
i'll get help.
no, no.
please don't go.
i have to.
were you in the army, joe?
me?
are you kidding?
where'd you get that idea?
what you said.
it's the way you communicate with that soldier.
what profession?
janet, she's probably very good.
my daughter's 0.
he's allergic, and he's got a special curtain to do.
well, what if something happens to you here...
okay, but if something happens to you, you have family, right?
i mean, your life can't wait either.
who's waiting for you at home?
exactly.
no one can wait.
joe?
joe, can you hear me?
what happened?
wait a minute!
we can't leave them to die.
we don't leave anybody behind, but there's a way to do it, a exhaustion.
okay.
okay.
you think they were shot?
i didn't hear anything.
i don't see any blood.
there should be a lot of blood.
i'm coming, too.
if i'm gonna get shot, you're gonna have to find out where it was fired.
okay.
mcnair!
obviously this doesn't work.
we have to go back.
come in!
come in!
let's go inside.
do you remember the last time you saw your daughter?
not recently.
we were both so busy.
he had a babysitting, so i...
to be honest, i wasn't talking to my daughter.
in fact, he wasn't talking to me.
until recently, he took me out of his life completely.
i never even met her husband.
he thought megan should know his grandmother.
he never thought i was a good parent.
he said i was being mean.
but i never hit him.
once.
i hit him with a hairbrush until it broke.
me and my daughter... with my daughter... me and
you see, both our wills are very strong.
i found this in your room.
no.
no, it's not mine.
who then?
thank you, grandma.
i can't wait for mom to come home to show me.
yeah, i'm sure he'll be very happy.
now take your baby upstairs and play with it.
i need to talk to mr. renbe.
come on.
come on.
if there's a good thing about this job, it's that i won a second chance.
it's a chance to be a good parent that i can't be.
yeah, that's definitely a blessing.
thank you for your time, ma'am.
and don't worry about your daughter.
i'm sure you'll be back soon.
i'm sure it'll all end well.
the supermarket is empty.
what about the others?
they're still lying there.
someone who's just passing through.
yeah, it could be anyone.
you gotta be kidding me.
oh, my god.
okay.
okay.
do you speak english?
i blinked, and then i woke up in that van.
it was like... it was like...
you ever use any demerol?
do as i say.
you heard me.
take off your shirt.
come on.
excuse me?
you heard me.
do as i say.
if it's drugged, it's got to be a print.
take off your pants.
hey, moira.
how about you and joe go into a room?
yeah.
look at this.
what the hell is that?
put your clothes on.
all right, everybody, pants off.
okay.
all right, hold your eyes, pervert.
we all do.
if i'm not mistaken, these are vaccines.
biometric vaccines.
they've been used to do a long-term drug, and they can be controlled from afar.
great.
i think we all have a large amount of sedative.
you know a lot about this.
my life is on drugs.
can you get them out?
they're very deep.
even if we had tools to open it and shut it down...
food.
come.
please.
eat.
sit down, please.
please.

here you go.
please sit down.
here you go.
please sit down.
we'll bring food.
please.
anybody got any food?
how are you?
best chinese food i ever had.
i can eat every day.
or if they kidnapped him?
what if my daughter is in a place like this?
don't think that.
you don't understand.
i wish they'd missed him, too.
then at least i knew you were safe.
thank you.
you've got to leave the decision to fate.
"your wife is waiting for you."
no... nobody else... nobody else
"your judgment is a bit excessive."
"you'll soon win a big prize."
you help others, you help yourself."
mine's chinese.

very strange.
janet?

what does yours say?
just... just... just... just...
"let him find his way."
irish fortune cookie?

she turned that thing around.
you can't think it's for you.
so don't let yourself down.
you like the food?
who are you?
i'm the night manager.
at night.
is that loaded?
how long have you been working here?
i started last night.
then you must have seen the men who brought us.
excuse me, ma'am, but when i started, you already checked in.
yesterday's records.
it says we checked in at 0:00 p.m.
yes, it is, ma'am.
excuse me, sir.
can i see your lighter?
great.

now listen.
we had a very long, very strange day.
at your service, sir.
what does he want to know... what he wants to
where are we?
i'm afraid i don't know.
that's not an answer.
okay, charlie.
where did you come from?
behind the hotel.
i think he meant before.
a man called and said i'd start work the next day.
and that doesn't seem odd to you?
i'm done.
take a good look.
look closely, ladies and gentlemen.
i was like this before.
see?
and now look.
now look.
it might seem impossible, it's me.
it's me, ladies and gentlemen!
and you ask yourself, how did he do it?
kiloaway!
how did he do it?
kiloaway!
and you think at home, this man is here to sell us kiloaway.
this guy's here to tell you how great he is.
wrong.
i'm not here to sell you kiloaway.
i'm not here to talk about kiloaway.
ladies and gentlemen, i'm not doing this.
my name is enrique fresan, and i'm a nutrition expert.
i'm here to tell you 0 steps of methods.
let's start with step 0.
bingo!
ladies and gentlemen, we have bingo.
this round ends.

how did he do it?
kiloaway!
where you are now, later?
you don't fit.
here we go.
smile for me.
come on, smile.
fucking fraud.
i don't treat people who want to lose weight, i treat people who want to find the cause of their obesity.
it's the only way to lose weight and stay away from him.
i won't put you on a diet.
eat whatever you want.
no more time, no more frustration.
before you hurry, with your own steps, you must find your own way.
the key shows up with a plan so we can help each other.
we're gonna ask each other questions, and we're gonna look for the answers in ourselves.
basically, we're gonna expose ourselves.
let's get started.
i want you all to stand up and take off your clothes.
nobody should be ashamed.
then you'd better leave.
honey, come on.
let's go.
i like being fat and naked.
it's as if you're a swimsuit models... as if you'
honey, please, let's go.
this has to be a cult...
be quiet.
i'm not fat, i'm overweight.
i lost 00 pounds four months ago.
then i started to lose weight.
one, two, three kilos... three kilog... three kilog
a little diet and exercise and they disappear.
0, 0, 0, 0, 00, 00... 00... 00... 00...

i've had insomnia since i was ten, so i have more time to do something and especially eat in the day.
me too.
i'm using sleeping pills because if i wake up at night, i'm starting to eat.
sofia, what are you doing?

you should go and let him stay.
you're not even fat.
i told you not to come.
you insisted.
and i'm glad i came.
come on, move.

what agony!
okay, we can start now.
let's get dressed.
what are you doing?
paula!
what are you doing?
so we can see it.
to see her or to control her?
to check.
what if we need a little privacy?
privacy or sex?
we can hang the spider.
we have to make no noise because it's a noise.
wait, don't tire yourself.
no, i want to finish it!
no tiring myself, no sex.
i'll do all the work, you can rest.
apples.
how's the new group?
did you take your clothes off?
you said you wouldn't.
yeah, but i did my speech, and i kept going...
and now you're horny and you want to fuck.
well, more or less.
i don't know about you, but i'm coming back.
i think we should talk about this community.
if you already know, that will answer the question.
and if you don't tell your family about it, you should give you a clue.
alex, i'm sick of this.
you're such a rebel, sofi.
we haven't even seen each other naked yet.
the future.
when, on our wedding night?
what if you don't like me suddenly?
we saw each other at salou last summer at the may.
it's not the same thing.
same thing.
then let's do it now.
yeah.
your parents will be here soon.
then we better hurry.
i'll open this button.
come on.
what do i have to say to give you up?
i'll do it anyway.
you never listen to me.

don't worry, do as i say!
because you're a pain in the asshole.
it's you, you're a troublemaker!
a sewer rat!
idiot!
where are you going?
my pictures are in a couple of magazines, on tv... and sales are down.
it'll cost you 0,000 euros all night.
0000 uero?
i'll show you what's worth.
how about a signed poster?
i've had more pictures in the magazines, and i've gotten even fatter, i ate more, and i'm more worried.
and more and more... and more... and more... and more
that's enough, my partner sued me, and as a precaution, he froze all my accounts.
do the pills work?
they can't affect your mood.
it's not my fault you're fat, asshole!
they object to daily energy.
and the others?
how does being fat affect you in your business?
i knew a new perfume brand at a mall.
but you'd think i was selling poison instead of perfume instead of perfume...
sofia, how can i help you?
now i'm working on a phone-dating business in a big company.
sofia, how can i help you?
i'm too fat to pursue bad guys, so i'm looking into dead men.
i was examining a body in casa isaac, a very expensive restaurant that i always wanted to go to one night.
the ring was stuck in his throat and drowned to death.
the waitress did it, but when the ring came out, it was too late.
there was something in the ring that i couldn't read.
i got curious and... licked the ring cleaned up.
i did it without thinking.
as a reflex.
the thing is, i like it.
she tasted fresh oysters and galicia wine.
i was wondering, what did the story say?
"i'll love you even in the barn."
fair enough.
how does being fat affect you in your job?
i work at home, so it doesn't.
i'm writing internet ptotics and system codes.
let me get this straight.
my boyfriend's an engineer, too.
we'd go to the gym together, eat healthy food, we'd be together in the morning... and we'd be together in the evening...
he doesn't know that, and i won't tell him.
a telecom specialist who doesn't have a webcam?
i didn't want to buy one.
why don't you tell him and get rid of him?
how about you help me lose 00 pounds?
when's he coming back?
in 0 months.
don't worry, if he's in america, he'll be back as fat as a pig.
does it work?
no, wait a minute.
then i'll give you a special treat.
did you go to him later?
no, i didn't.
maybe you should go.
it's not just about saving ourselves.
it's about saving the others, or at least trying.
i'll go if i have to.
you don't trust alex?
but i don't like her looking at naked beautiful women.
maybe that's why he doesn't want to see me naked.
sofia, please... please... sofia,
there are more effective ways to get to know each other.
why is everything about sex bad or wrong?
you just have to wait for the right time, the right reason and the right place.
speaking of which, why don't you tell them about the cult you joined?
they do strange things.

i'd hit you, but i don't want my hands to be pig fat.

under stress?
when you're satisfied?
i mean all day.
one cupcake, two cupcakes, then i'll go to the chocolate, another cupcake, and then i'll have my lunch, a cup of chocolate, a cupcake, a little later dinner, and then a dinner, a tiny piece of chocolate.
isn't that what everyone expects from me?
look, he's fat again."
i'm guilty.
i found an effective method to deal with it.
sharing.
so you're making the people around you fat.

don't be so ungrateful.
since we know you don't love him, we got you this.
you're putting the electrodes in your body, and it's pissing off the saggy areas.
if there was a zillion electrodes, it'd be good.
cell phone!
he's got a camera and everything, and you won't bother your sister anymore.
the megapixel's higher than yours, big ass.
eat, honey.
then use your body shaped and you're done.
guess where i am.
i'm on a plane.
where?
teo, teo!
teo, come here!
teo!
teo, come!
teo!
teo, honey.
see this?
amniot kes is over.
you can lose the baby.
what should i do?
paula, what do you think about spending the rest of your pregnancy in bed?
wait... wait... wait... wait... wait
ready?
one, two... and three.
what is it?
latex bed.
it's a gift from mom.
it's not a bed, it's two mattresses
no, look.
you're putting two together with this zipper.
of course, you don't know that... or your mother.
don't start with mom again.
you really... really... you really... you
you want someone else?
that's pretty comfortable.
and we're gonna fit in a meter.
you didn't get excited at the sex shop the other day, did you?
no.
you're all i love.
i'm scared.
why?
you can get tired of me.
that doesn't mean anything.
it means i love you more than anything.
ugly, fat and disgusting.
i don't believe you, i don't...
how can i prove it?
you're not touching me.
touching.
what am i doing now?
that's not touching.
it is!
that's not touching, alex.
that's touching.
and abraham said:
creation, creation, creation, creation, creation
chapter 00 episode 00 episode 00 episode 00
the right moment is the right reason, and the right place.
don't film me!
go, fat, go.
go on.
what do you want?
you don't have to sue me for that.
i've never seen you run before this trial.
you obviously need a little push.
you're an asshole and you'll never hurt me.
then get lost, snot.
i sold the loft.
you sold my penthouse?
you have one week to move.
son of a bitch!
i'm not moving, okay?
what are you doing?
don't pretend to me.
up, there are people around.
jesus... jesús... jesus... jesú
help!
help... help me... help me... help
relax now?
well, yeah, i don't know.
shall we do it again?
the sin is already done.
right.
maybe this time you'll last long enough to get him in.
we need protection for this.
the mattress is in a baggage.
it won't stain.
alex... alex... alex... alex...
that's not what i meant.
if we do this, we face the consequences.
okay.
you had a little memory.
you just panicked.
what about the other guy?
you know him?
my partner.
he's got severe trauma to the skull.
it triggered an aneurysm and severe cardiac arrest.
we're trying to keep her in balance, but she's probably brain damaged.
enrique... enrique... enri
oh, jesus!
my jesus!
what happened to him, enrique?
i'll die!
what did they do to him?
do it now.
be brave enough to do that.
i know you're gonna leave me.
because i'm fat.
because you're not gonna want to be with someone as fat as me.
because you always hated fat people.
that's why i want you to leave me now.
don't touch me.
stop.
stop!
i haven't left the house in 0 months.
all i do is work and eat.
i don't have a life without german.
i can't do anything without her.
you can't spend your whole life with a man.
i didn't try different things, i didn't live, i didn't experience it.
i feel like i've been missing the opportunity of my life for 00 years.
i got fat because i wanted him to leave me.
leave me, leave me, leave me!
i was running and my partner came to cheer me up.
all of a sudden i heard a sound, and i came back and a man was fighting with my partner.
i thought you robbed him.
he pushed it and ran.
i tried to call for help, but... clearly my heart couldn't stand it.
did you see the man who robbed him?
no.
it was dark.
did you have someone with problems with your partner?
no.
last question.
you're the kiloaway man, aren't you?
kiloaway!
kiloaway!
kiloaway!
kiloaway!
kiloaway!
kiloaway!
kiloaway!
look at you, please.
in the privacy of your houses, in front of the mirror.
if your answer is yes, forget what the doctors and the community say.
stop feeling bad.
forget my method, kiloaway pills.
let's move to step 0.
i'm step one step one step step
it's not important to lose weight, it's how you feel.
define yourself with a word.
light.
happy.
terrible.
let's see if your feelings are connected to your weight.
00 kilos lighter.
i beat the happy nun.
looks like the only person in connection with the weight loss is sofia.
why do you think you lost weight?
i don't know, i've been more active in the last few months.
i have a purpose and motivation.
but i think it's because i'm actually more satisfied in spirit.
a lot more.
i've got some cold water, that's good for your heart.
you wouldn't believe the fuss they made for the ramp.
we must support each other in this life.
i put your clothes in the closet.
i was tired of seeing them all scattered around.
disaster!
right away.
what's this?
i checked every test personally.
i can't believe it either.
what happened?
eat shit, big ass!
i've only failed one less lesson!
asshole.
you're out of one p.e. class.
this teacher must really like you.
paula, what's wrong?
i don't fit in my pants.
if you know they won't be yours, why are you wearing them?
they used to be and i wanted to look nice for you.
you look great.
i'm gonna break this fucking mirror.
you've been staring at yourself all day... all day
look at my tits, grown-ups!
good.
you don't like big tits.
don't lie to me.
i'm so scared.
listen to me for a second.
paula, i'm not sick of you.
you're tired of yourself.
how many four months pregnant women look better than that?
all of them.
they all tell me how wonderful the pregnancy is.
that's not what i expected.
you can't go on like this.
it's pointless.
i know.
you didn't invite anybody?
put something on.
i told my parents i wanted to take special lessons from you.
or staying at school.
i can't stand being anywhere.
you're the only one who's been nice to me and has a bigger belly than me.
you can't move, can you?
i can do your shopping, keep you company, do some cleaning...
you want shelter?
a little.
take off your homework.
how's the new p.e. teacher?
he's an idiot.
he's running us nonstop.
but i just walk like i do with you.
i'm holding it in case my blood drops.
in case your blood drops?
give me that.
open the book.
give me the candy.
open the book.
is it fixed?
yeah, all right.
if it breaks again, i'll break it in your head.
now in cab 0, erika...
erika...
hey, honey.
how was work?
good.
he was staring at his ass.
who, carlos?
i'm so excited!
i don't find it funny.
you're jealous.
no.
you think that's true?
do you like me looking at other girls?
you wouldn't, would you?
i don't think it's funny either.
because i'm not good.
i just think about having sex with you.
and again.
i see you dressed like that, and... and... and... and... and
we could stop by the way.
did they bring another furniture?
we're sex addicts.
no, we're addicts.
pilar... pilar... pilar p
we should start sleeping apart.
i can't, i'm scared.
fine, but i gotta go out and find a new apartment.
find a place to stay and someone to take care of you.
pilar!
the doctor says i'm good enough to live on.
what's wrong?
you're my partner's wife.
we can't play the happy couple.
fine, but you're gay.
you'll be fine.
besides, we were friends before i met jesus.
remember when we slept together in college?
it was awful!
i was sure i was gay that day.
jesus hadn't been with me for 00 months.
i guess he was a little gay.
pilar, no.
i'm horny.
close your eyes and think i'm a man.
no!
it's like i'm one of those hot kids you fuck 000 euros.
let's see what happens.
use some teeth.
that's it, gently, careful... careful...
until you bend over and give me a blowjob.
have you become a ereksion?
how was it?
blow job sucks.
you'll enjoy this experience as much as i enjoy it.
what about him?
did you do something to her?
like what?
like what he did to you.
no, gross!
one question, mr. therapist.
isn't it a little extraordinary for you to discuss personal issues at the bar?
a beer can reveal things in therapy that don't reveal themselves.
like your heterosexual relationship.
the nun really bothers me.
he's always talking about his happy and muffins and another cupcake and another cupcake and another cupcake... and another cupcake... and another
boy!
i think i just saw leonor leave.
i swear it was him.
another one!
what happened to the greedy manager?
i don't know.
one day he came to the wrong group.
sorry, i think i came at the wrong time.
it wasn't the wrong time, it was the wrong day.
and he never came back.
i did, but he didn't answer.
then he sent a message saying he quit.
potato chips anyone?
take one.
what was our deal?
i'm just suggesting potato chips.
if he gets it, i'll get it.
i feel guilty when i eat alone.
you said to stop blaming ourselves.
giving up is another thing, putting it on other people's back.
give me that fucking chip!
no more guilt.
feel better?
much better.
how much more pizza are we gonna look at?
all i can get is a cold pizza.
"i'm a fat, pushed out of society, i can eat whatever i want" excuse.
i don't want to hear any more of this, you understand?
your excuse is ready.
yes, it is.
what's this?
it's a school trip collecting tickets.
you never sold it.
i'm not going to a party or a trip.
samuel's not going?
i don't think so.
alas, it looks good.
come on, like dad said.
one for you, one for me, and everybody's happy.
okay.
you're right, only the fat kid in class might like me.
fat couple, how nice.
"how nice." do you like him?
incompetent, ridiculous, irresponsible, completely pathetic... pathetic... pathetic... pathetic... pathetic
great.
if you send him a message, you can eat a slice.
no 0 slices, no deal.
i'll take the candy from your purse and 0 slices.
there's no sugar in my bag.
okay, okay.
not the big one, take the small one.
aren't you eating?
i don't eat snacks.
you never mentioned him.
he's learning spanish, and he's becoming a good christian.
he's gonna sing us a religious song from his country.
okay?
come on, champ.
i dedicate the song to my friend sofia.
that's how you marry me.
how cute.
imagine walking down the aisle to the altar.
no, we're gonna have a proper choir.
koro can make a good fund music.
if you don't let me catch my beard, you can forget this music.
like tarzan.
spear.
okay, therapist.
you sure you don't want to close your eyes and let yourself go?
no, it's not ethical because i'm your therapist.
so bye.
can i have another beer?
you brought your boyfriend.
he's not my boyfriend, he's a jerk.
he told me he was crazy about you.
i just spoke to him, and he said you were great.
i hate alcohol.
relax, you'll get the job.
come on!
i hate alcohol too.
hi.
pilar, what are you doing here?
the pills aren't working without you.
you don't belong here.
why?
i can help you, idiot.
there are less busy ways.
don't pay.
why would you pay for sex?
you can't have someone who really loves you.
i don't want to love anyone, understand?
for not finding the right person.
i'm not the right person for anyone, pilar.
come on.
pilar, i'm gay, okay?
i like men, don't you see?
go away!
go!
why?
i can't hear you.
i pretended i was asleep when you came home late, and you still fucked me?
yeah, i remember.
i saw my gynecologist today.
you know, normal life.
okay.
i have something to do tomorrow.
relax, i'll be right in.
you want me to fall asleep.
i want you to come to bed with me.
and i'm telling you i'll clean up first.
paula?
aren't yours helping you deal with your brother?
mine just think about themselves and their perfect marriage.
all they do is fuck all day.
whoa!
you have to learn to protect yourself.
i found a rat poison on the internet that's unpleasant.
paula, if she's staying, i'll sleep on the couch.
you're gonna sleep on every sofa anyway.
come on, put it away.
one for you...
come on.
and one for me.
tastes good, doesn't it?
i used to feel different when i was a kid.
i didn't like girls playing soccer or anything like that.
because if you're fat and alone, no one's gonna ask you why you're not acting like the others.
no one would have noticed that i was gay.
but i didn't give up my mess until the special olympics in '00.
they let me volunteer, miraculously, miraculously, miraculously, mirac
and they gave me to the swimmers.
there was an incredibly handsome australian who was holding her to me to get her out of the pool because she didn't have legs.
i don't know what makes me happier, if he smiles on his wheelchair or if he's on my virginity.
my first joke was an obstacle.
i'm tired of being gay.
really.
we're supposed to be sensitive, happy, full of life, tolerant.
it's a priority of mankind.
and that's not me.
i can't wait all night for muzice.
go.
you have to pay anyway.
i'm a con man.
i'm the worst faggot of all time.
i'm a lying, evil, ruthless cramp.
i'm a contradiction.
contradictions don't have to be bad.
they can always be explained by something we're not ready to face.
so it's better to avoid them, face them, see where they're taking us.
because a lot of contradictions would bring out the answers we're looking for.
put your hands on your belly.
close your eyes.
let's all breathe together.
drink up... drink up...
breathe, breathe.
i thought it was my pregnancy, but it was me.
we all have contradictions.
they're on the first step in order to understand what we want or what we don't want in our lives.
you're deported, but you worship?
i broke the machine on purpose to get back there.
i broke it.
that you worship, but you press?
the one that you pushed, the one that freed you?
the one who set you free, but the shame?
you're a shame, but you love?
what is it that you refuse, but what you love?
are you doing this because you want to or just keep acting like everything's okay?
society wants you to be fat.
if you're fat, everybody feels better because they feel superior.
not anymore.
it's time to take my first step.
hang on to the reins of your life.
one move could change the dynamic.
but one day of enthusiasm isn't enough for a bottle of kilo-away.
kilo-away doesn't work miracles.
it gives you the support you need in the long, hard road of success.
believe me, there's only one way to do it.
let's take step three.
white, pure and clear.
00 kilos lighter.
it's almost brown shit color.
00 kilos lighter.
once again, i beat the happy nun.
shall we choose a flower that recognizes ourselves, an astronaut, a tropical bird living in the amazon?
i don't like big tits.
let's see.
your glucose level is higher.
not exactly pathological, but you have to be careful.
you can be diabetes.
your blood pressure's up.
after what you said, it's not weird.
don't worry, paula.
everything's gonna be all right.
just watch what you eat.
if you weren't always with that girl...
what?
nothing.
what are you doing, big fuck?
you can use blood, hair, nails, body fluid or something.
to separate the dna, it's taken by proctological enzymes and separatists.
years ago, this process was taking weeks.
today, with this machine, it can be done in less than 00 hours.
so i'm half your note.
we're a pair of egg twins, so these are the last four apartments... and they should match.
i wasn't closed.
i even had a lovely boyfriend.
the thing is, it wasn't from the community.
i tried to get him into the community, but he wasn't into the spiritual stuff.
i mean, he didn't want to be a virgin until he got married.
he got tired of waiting and left me.
i'm depressed, but then alex came.
actually, alex was always there.
two eggs, fried rice, shrimp noodles and moo shu pork.
any fries?
a portal.
i want a salad with a bean sprout.
i got really fat when i started dating alex.
i can still examine another body.
why?
you gotta eat, you're big bones.
that's why i brought you to the chinese restaurant.
let me eat whatever i want.
it's not gonna work.
what happened to your cousin who lost weight in his gym?
now look, he's fater than he used to be.
cover it up, sofia, for god's sake.
that's how girls wear it.
how long?
come on, you like it.
of course you do.
you like it.
you always do what you know.
you're forcing me to make a scene.
i'm not hungry anymore.
you like what you did?
you've lost my appetite.
sofi, really... really... sofi
you're such a rebel.
how am i supposed to eat more than you do without losing weight?
i looked around and all i could find were you two big boys.
you know, you're out of class and your sister's a little heavier than usual.
that fat bitch just ruined my life from the start.
you have a lot of baby pictures.
i just found one.
and i was 0.
being adopted doesn't matter that much.
it's not biological, it's an emotional issue.
stop kidding!
don't say such things.
i'm gonna go crazy and leave home.
thank god.
luis, you're not adopted.
what about the dna test?
if it's applied properly.
nuria probably forgot to do the hybrid of the samples.
i did, i put them on the thermomix steam cycle.
how did you transfer the pieces to the nitro cellulosis?
i wrapped a aluminum foil in a 00-minute heat oven.
ten out of ten.
how did he do it again?
thanks to what?
thanks to me.
pilar, i'm rehearsing.
so i can fuck you.
it's a good thing you think of my anal needs.
you don't... you don't like
of course i do.
great tool.
you want to try?
this is our routine now.
we bring him chocolate, but since he can't eat, we eat.
then i vomit.
then, movie, we share a super year.
then i'm super sick.
then dinner, some champagne, a nice view...
and i... vomit.
then it's comforting me.
then i comfort her.
i'll die!
why do you think you're so sick?
i've come to conclude that some reason isn't long in my body.
he used to watch the digestive normal thing, but suddenly he's working the opposite.
i know what you're thinking, therapist.
aren't you tired of this crap?
aren't you tired of reality?
my life is normal for the first time.
just like i know you're here to justify yourself to keep eating like a pig.
he's condemning himself to a man who doesn't deserve him.
what is it, paula?
what's this?
you tell me.
let's discuss this later.
no, we're going to argue.
i don't care!
it's your fault i'm unhappy all day.
is that how he treats you?
does he throw your food away?
does it make you feel like shit?
or is it just me?
explain to me why you don't love me, that you don't like me, that i feel sick!
if you knew how much i hate you.
and you, take care of your fucking kids.
now we've learned your nonsense, therapist.
"and the light came to earth... and the light came to
"because the bad things that do bad things stay away from the light, they hide from it so that their surgeries are not punished."
stop, stop.
what are you doing?
go on.
my turn, not yours.
what's your turn for?
since when do you have more than one orgasm?
you wanted to be on top, now you want to be an orgasm twice.
what's next?
i don't know, we'll find out.
were you touching yourself?
is that why you stay in the bathroom so long?
stop it.
are you crazy?
don't mess with me.
come here.
don't be stupid.
you made me do everything!
shit!
look how angry you make me.
you think i like being like this?
look what i'm in.
you think that's good?
look at me, sofia.
look at me.
you think i want this?
no, my love.
i look at you, you look dirty.
dirty, dirty, dirty!
you... you... you... you...
fucking device.
what are you doing?
i'm trying to start it.
drowning him won't help.
tell me the truth, father.
i want to know the truth.
just because you're weak doesn't mean you're not family.
you're gross, fat and ugly, but you're smart, like my mom, like nuria.
you always treat me like an idiot.
i don't fit into this shitty family.
okay, i'll repeat the test to prove it to you.
but, luis, you're so smart.
there's no stupid part in his body.
what the hell are you doing?
i need a test.
i gotta cut off his balls.
what a smart son!
i've been with you for ten years.
as soon as something starts to sound difficult?
or is it difficult?
am i the tough one?
therapist who treats fat people can't stand the image of his own fat wife.
you brought your job home.
look at me.
you can't even look at me.
you don't like me anymore?
tell me.
tell me what's difficult.
i don't want to look at you!
i love you with all my heart and i can't imagine life without you.
it's like i'm the most retarded person in the world.
because you are.
it's called "letter letter."
"my nicodemus asked jesus,
'how can an old man be born?
yahuda 00. 00. 00. 0
the part i wrote.
"ofi, i know i'm not gonna be born again, i can't go back in time to fix my mistakes.
all i can do is learn from them and not repeat them.
you're the one i want to learn to be better and be happy with.
i want to get on the road to adventure and salvation.
alex.
deal?
yeah, we agreed.
will everything be the same?
it'll be like before.
no sex until the wedding.
and my orgasms?
okay.
and you're gonna get fat again.
what?
you said: everything will be the same.
don't i look better now?
of course you do.
that's why i said it.
to stop us from obstructing the devil.
bastard!
you've been pulling me all this time, making me think i can't do better.
i'm ashamed to be with you.
i'm glad this happened today because i realized i never wanted to see you again.
dirty!
jesus?
i'm sorry, jesús.
first, me or you?
you.
leave me, leave me, leave me!
i left him.
i love you, but i don't love you.
this kind of relationship creates a lot of addiction.
we decided to stay friends.
and when we agreed to that, we were together.
typical goodbye sex.
i wasn't fat.
and i was charming.
and lightly wild.
my doubts have begun.
maybe break-up wasn't a good idea.
we decided to be together.
every night, the insomnia and anxiety came back.
he wasn't there to comfort me.
i felt so bad i came to therapy on the wrong day.
sorry, i think i came at the wrong time.
it's not the wrong time, it's the wrong day
i came to the bar.
i didn't want to go home.
suddenly, i realized a man looked at me all the time.
i thought you were amazing how fat i was, and i wanted to get up.
i asked the waiter for the check, but he said he paid for my drink.
i don't know how it happened, he showed up with me.
we were drinking whiskey instead of coffee.
he kept saying how beautiful i was, and it wasn't bad.
and then i remembered what i said about trying new things, experimenting with other men, and i found myself comforting...
that's how i met the second guy i ever laid.
what can i say?
it was better than any therapy.
i was desired, i wasn't fat.
of course, the next week i was feeling fat and gross and i couldn't stop eating.
i'm supposed to be consoled... consoled...
i needed to be consoled.
that's how i met the third man i ever laid.
but something made me feel like you wouldn't approve of my behavior.
it may not mean a lot to me, but i guess i wasn't ready to hear it.
let's go.
where?
to meet your wife and children in london.
where did you think you were?
that's how i met the fourth man i've ever had.
that's just like the second and third, he was handsome, and he had a happy marriage.
so i decided to continue sleeping with handsome and married men for three reasons:
i didn't want to get attached.
i was convinced it wouldn't happen again this morning.
what convinced you?
the return of german.
i guess that's why i slept with all those guys.
i thought it would be easier to forget german.
if he hadn't left because i lost 00 pounds, maybe he would've left because i slept with 00 men.
you see, there's something i've decided to go after.
what did you decide to go after?
i don't know.
i don't even know if i want you to help me or fuck me.
or help me by fucking me.
because you're handsome and i know you're married.
what about you, what's up?
jesus!
i loved you so much!
paula!
pregnant lady, are you there?
ice cream is melting!
paula!
hi, it's abel.
i had no idea why men with handsome and happy marriage would want to sleep with a fat woman.
i was wondering.
until one day you stop worrying.
so don't worry, i won't ask.
what's wrong?
you've ruined everything.
everything.
luis, it was a joke.
if i let your jokes get to me like this, i'd have killed myself already.
i'm glad you're not my big-ass twin sister.
stop yelling.
of course we're twins.
if our fathers are different, we're not.
what?
the twins have different fathers, different fathers, different fathers
you screwed up good this time!
tell me who you are!
say it!
say it!
what's going on?
what's going on here?
tell him who his father is.
you're my father.
at least tell him!
tell him who you are!
he deserves to know who his father is!
tell him who you fucking instead of me!
i've been with you my whole life!
i put up with this shitty life!
hi, it's abel.
please come.
