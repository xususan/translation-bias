gosh, there was so much traffic.
i just talked to him.
who's miss k?
you know him, right?
"should i say something like, ""oh, i'm not that kind of a woman."""
get me the address of one of our rookies.
i know you think it's absurd.
then sing while you wait for me.
no problem.
it's a bad year for us.
since when do you care?
i've liked darling oska for eight years.
her stunt team is filming oska's music video.
are you trying to prove just how incompetent you are?
i stole something.
but you see, it's just that... we've never even had friendly hello sex.
it's just that... you see, this is actually my first time.
seems like just yesterday my dad picked me up after my first year at college.
"we popped a couple of beers... and he said, ""now, you're a man."""
"i think i bring new meaning to the word ""cool,"" honey."
it's a perfectly normal thing for two human beings to do.
it was brought up at a pta meeting.
anyway, my point is... these little sexual debacles should not get you down... because you know what?
"well, she referred to it as ""shrink wrapping."""
and then my social-psych professor in baskin-robbins.
but i'll tell you, none of these women even compare to--
my name's christy.
well, i put the word out so high school chicks would come.
just 'cause you fuckers don't have dicks doesn't make it okay for you to be here.
is it true that paul finch nailed your mom?
did you see those fuckers i had to boot out of here?
"splat. ""oh, wait, nadia, don't go."" splat."
and vicky got hot!
yeah, jim, i see her.
and i would know.
look, we'll-- we'll just do this, okay?
nova, as in casanova, the guy who had all the moves.
hey, everyone, listen up!
nova's back, baby... and he's taken the lock off his cock!
come back here, you little fucker!
you two relax and shake hands.
why is everybody taking a piss right now?
hey, man, you're the guy who boned stifler's mom.
if i didn't have to hold my dick 'cause i gotta piss, i would shake your hand.
i've been saving this for a special occasion... for a special girl, just like you.
you know, they warn us about these situations in college.
now, you may be intoxicated.
are you certain that you wish to engage in consenting--
how 'bout i give you a little champagne?
this is kind of kinky, and i like that.
half these got east high parking passes on them.
okay, now... do these high school kids think we're cool... because they're at a college party... or are we those weird older guys... that try to hang out with high school kids when we come home?
no, man, stifler's got shut down.
we can't party anywhere any more.
yep, things are gonna get weirder.
my friends and i knew that it was up to us to stick together.
we treated every day out there lie it was a post-prom party.
yes, i am sure to go see the lion king.
i know they've done wonderful things with that city, but, you know, for me--
you have not forgotten about me, have you?
i hope you're ready for me... because i have not forgotten about you either, you sexy boy.
no, finch, it's not the hot dogs.
she's coming here at the end of the summer and she wants to see me.
nadia is gonna be expecting filet mignon.
okay, and all i'm gonna be able to give her... is rump roast.
ah, yes, you would be referring to... the flute-fetish band geek that made me her bitch, then ditched me after prom.
you just gotta find the right girl, jimbo.
she just sells her cottage and takes off to parts unknown.
my romantic life has passed its peak.
everybody on the beach is gonna know us.
plenty of opportunities to practise for nadia.
throw a huge party at the end of the summer to cap it all off.
i've been running these numbers here... and i don't think the four of us can afford this place.
so, i invited someone else.
stifler, if you're gonna be living with us, you gotta behave yourself.
all right, you and finch just stay out of each other's way.
kevin, stifler's stench is unavoidable.
will you idiots tell me what this fucker's doin'?
"""tantric?"" what the fuck is tantric?"
you learn to channel your body's energies-- your chakras.
when you can do that, you can have sex for hours, even days.
it's been around for centuries.
with tantra you can make an entire session of sex... feel like one giant orgasm.
eventually, you can sustain that feeling by meditating.
maybe you can teach me sometime?
come on, jim.
i guess there's only one person that really knows for sure, huh?
hey, are you here for the mid-session performance?
you're really here?
we're not supposed to have visitors... 'cause this one time, here... this kid had these cookies--
let me guess.
a bear came.
it's like you know all our stories.
do you wanna answer it anyway?
i left you like-- like three messages after prom.
you didn't think i was weird... because of the way i acted that night?
weird, no.
i get nasty when i'm horny.
that's kind of why i'm here.
you remember, was i any good that night?
you didn't know what the hell you were doing.
but wasn't it fun even though you were so terrible?
i could give you some pointers if you want.
what are you doing?
it's piss-poor to be this late.
you can tell by the tone of my voice i'm angry.
well, that explains everything.
but we are just so overjoyed... to have someone with your kind of talent here.
i know it's not yours... but you are going to make beautiful music.
you just own this and break a leg.
kids, entertain yourselves.
folks, he's just a little nervous.
thank you!
and i have gigantic balls!
he is special.
he's my bitch.
well, michele has confirmed it.
i gotta get some practice.
we plop a keg on the deck and the girls come in off the beach.
it's like a hummingbird feeder.
fellas, nice pad.
high likelihood of a sausage fest in progress.
the sherminator's got a point, kev.
since when do you start listening to the sherminator?
since he made me realize there's an abundance of wiener here.
i mean, look around, dude.
all right, now it's your turn.
you know, we're just trading war stories about college-- who hooked up with who, who slept with who--
so, vicky?
you know, there was a few girls-- three.
now that kevin told us, what about you?
you haven't had the slightest bit of attraction to any girl at school?
even if i did... it wouldn't be anything more than just a momentary thing.
very uninteresting.
how many chicks did you sleep with this year?
where are the fuckin' females?
jim, can't you leave your shirt on?
the force is strong in that one.
the sherminator detects serious heat at a distance of two metres.
preparing to deploy beer.
dude, let me give you a valuable piece of advice, okay?
please repeat previous statement.
look, i know your last name is sherman, right?
but you can't tell me a girl's ever really gone for it.
vic, hey, you guys are leaving?
you know, we barely had a chance to hang out, you know, catch up.
what are you doing this weekend?
bye, kev.
see ya, jess.
no, no, that's all wrong.
"so what does he mean, ""meet up""?"
well, we're friends.
but it's not like i see her making plans with anyone else.
hey, vicky only slept with one guy since we went out.
i mean, that like makes me 50%% of her entire guy-related life.
you dipshit.
when a girl tells you how many guys she slept with... multiply it by three and that's the real number.
didn't you fuckers learn anything at college?
he did not sleep with three girls, much like sly and the family stone... aren't gonna dance in here and gang-bang me... between the afros and the bell-bottoms, okay?
the rule of what?
if a guy tells you how many girls he's been with, it's not even close to that.
it's an exact science, consistent as gravity.
ozzy, i'm happy for you.
at least you've seen a nice bod while heather's off sucking' dick.
keep your fantasies to yourself.
dude, use your fuckin' brain.
"""i'm the american college chick."
your european cultural shit is so charming.
"love your ding-dong."""
i'm tellin' you, right now there is a dick in your girlfriend's mouth.
guys, check it out.
lesbians.
you know, mr homophobic wizard... that it is possible for women to hold hands and not be gay.
hey, finch, i don't wanna hear about you and your boyfriends.
go jerk off.
unnecessary.
tantra teaches you to hold an orgasm over time... in anticipation of an ultimate moment... to release it upon the world.
i'm filling up to the brim.
that's fucking disgusting!
i'm gonna throw up.
i'd hardly call it studying.
he's got a girlfriend back in france, so we've kind of got something in common.
yeah, i've overheard them on the phone at night.
and, well, it made me think.
hey, oz, i'm reaching under my shirt and i'm rubbing myself.
i'm going over to my bed.
and i'm lying down.
and i'm slowly... reaching downstairs.
listen, heather, i'm feeling kind of awkward.
if we can't be with each other, then we have to learn to be more vocal.
right?
okay, here we go.
i'm reaching in my pants now.
and i'm rubbing it for you, heather.
and it feels so good.
i got--
i got my hand on my dick right now, okay... and i'm trying to have sex with my girlfriend over the phone.
good for you, man.
i think you were reaching for something.
oh, yeah.
hey, oz, i'm touching myself.
what else do you want me to do?
heather, baby.
why don't you tell me my dick is as big as stifler's.
i am getting off just listening to the two of you guys.
we should try this another time.
nice talking with you, steven.
potential lesbians leaving the building.
i need confirmation.
hey, man, what are you doing?
go get him.
big blue rubber dicks for everyone!
dildo, dildo, dildo!
danielle, amber, hi.
just needed the paper, huh?
which room?
i'm in a lesbian stronghold.
happy painting, boys.
very original, steven.
don't call me steven.
i can wear that little leopard bikini of mine.
help me zip, please.
they're getting naked.
oh, man.
this girl is so hot.
two possible lesbians in their bras and panties.
did you say lesbians?
that better not have been what i thought it was.
i'll get you the blue stringy number.
johnny west is missing.
maybe you kicked it under the bed.
didn't you have it when we were downstairs?
guys, get the hell out of there right now.
i'm just so glad i found him.
he's my favourite collectible.
i know.
guys, we got nothin' to worry about.
i just remembered, i got that dildo from the other bedroom.
there's a dildo in my drawer.
oh, my god!
you could have asked me if you wanted to borrow it.
stop it.
my god, it's the painting kids.
i'm still calling the cops.
but we just followed him in to get him out.
i just wanted proof that you chicks are really lesbians.
you wanna mess with 'em?
yeah, it'll be fun.
let's do it.
you guys like that?
ozzy, stand by for confirmation.
that's a big 10-4 on the confirmation.
sounds like your little friends outside wanna play too.
you won't be needing this.
who wants me to touch amber?
i do, i do.
i'm turning off my radio now.
where should i touch amber?
i got some painting i should--
and i would love to see that show.
bravo!
one finger on the cheek.
we want... palm grasping.
you don't touch, we don't touch.
red leader, what's your position?
i'm touching his ass.
i'm touching his ass.
that really wasn't bad.
danielle is feeling my breasts.
no way, dude!
her breasts are so luscious.
what a wonderful christmas gift you bought the boys.
my nipples are so hard.
i think i can fix these.
one, two... three.
as you were.
them girls sound like the two transvestites we picked up in biloxi.
okay, i think that's enough now.
i need to keep this party goin'.
i'm takin' one for the team.
why can't you guys be team players, huh?
i was the one doin' all the sacrificing'.
and now for our devoted listeners, back to the show.
let me try that dildo.
stifler wanted to give you two hand jobs?
stifler wanted one from us.
"you guys, you wanna play some ""asshole""?"
just watching the game, kev.
i just wanna do something together.
now, just so there's no confusion...
santa porn has just brought us some heterosexual entertainment.
and the stifmeister's provided us some complimentary lubricant.
whack away, jim.
stifmeister's palace of love-- straight love.
i didn't really think you were gonna be in michigan this summer.
yeah, you're more than welcome to be here.
stifler's mom is coming here.
efforts must be doubled.
"""efforts must be doubled."""
jenny, where'd you put my clarinet?
i'm a bad, bad man.
jim, what are you doing here?
well, i thought you had said--
you can't just stand out here.
loo, i need your help.
well, i know that feeling.
spend your life playing in the band... it doesn't exactly give you the ultra-cool hipster image.
i think you're pretty cool.
michele, why did you ditch me after prom?
i mean, did you want some... funky, weird, next-morning goodbye?
it's not like i wanted you to pretend you were in love with me or something.
why would i pretend that?
yeah, well, i'm not like other guys.
okay, i'm gonna help you.
really?
let's just get started.
no, you dingbat.
you don't just go groping away.
you gotta preheat the oven before you stick in the turkey.
good, jim.
no, i was just saying that so you could practise.
does direction matter, like clockwise, counter clockwise?
okay, jim, this is what i'm talking about.
your main problem is you're so uptight.
do i seem uptight about my sexual stuff?
the biggest pointer i could give you is... you have to feel comfortable in any situation.
gilligan's island, mr howell.
you've got to control yourself and think of something nonsexual.
i haven't even touched you yet, and you're turning into the sears tower.
cleaning my bathroom.
dung beetles.
now, don't freak out.
i'm gonna do something to push your threshold.
okay, i think you've just crossed my threshold.
pointer-- less tongue.
"""best thing was the blow-out at tom myers' place."
guys, this is what our party's gotta be.
chicago is beautiful, but it would be better if you were here.
well, i wish you were here, nadia.
do you want me to clean you?
"""apply a few drops to achieve desired lubrication."""
all right.
i that a loofah, or are you just glad to see me?
what the hell.
shit.
god!
i been missin' out.
oh, shit!
everybody okay?
shut the fuck up or i'll break down this door and pummel your ass!
okay, good night, then.
yeah, i kind of...
super glued myself... to myself.
no, no!
don't send an ambulance.
look, is there anything, you know, around the house?
paint thinner.
stay where you are!
hands where we can see 'em!
get the other hand up, god damn it!
i can't!
i'm glued!
sorry.
relax your hands.
i'll take it from here, okay?
you're gonna be fine, buddy.
jim, this happens to the best of us.
left foot first.
okay, sir, you're just gonna have to wait here.
this summer's turned out to be great.
mucilage is dangerous territory... and i would think any adhesive product... would have a warning right on the tube.
i thought it was a lubricant.
i was trying to use lubricant.
son, couldn't you have left that disgusting thing at home?
excuse me?
well, that kind of material is offensive to me.
oh, well, we're sorry.
but, you see, my son couldn't leave it at home... because he's having a bit of a medical emergency.
your opinion of his taste in video rentals, i'm afraid... is not a priority, lady.
it's at the bottom of the totem pole.
thank you.
my son... is sitting here right now... with his hand glued to his penis!
but that doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
because you don't have a penis!
or maybe you do!
i'm sorry.
you know, it just bugs me when people speak before they think.
you know, they speak.
boy, that doesn't look too bad, jim.
good job, doctor.
the swelling should subside in about eight or nine days.
eight or nine--
beach party's in a week.
nadia's coming.
i'd tell your son to keep his pants on during that party.
but if his pants... decide to come off during the party... could he have full use of his... penis?
okay.
this should shave a couple of days off.
oh, good.
thank you, doctor.
jim... that's good news.
little chilly out there.
well, here we are.
i think the whole glue thing might get her a little queasy.
i don't know how i get myself into these things.
but thanks for understanding.
you've been really cool.
i mean, between this and... you know--
you know, you may be jimbo or jumbo... or jimbodinny to these guys in here, but...
i want you to know there are two people... who still remember where james emanuel levenstein came from.
we're awful proud of you, son.
thanks, dad.
don't forget your penis cream.
that was it.
one more stimulant, i would have had full release.
finch, stay the fuck away from that fiicus.
that's a jizz-free fiicus.
my dick looks like a paint-by-numbers.
you're the only guy i know whose dick needs an instruction manual.
casa de stifler.
you know, if you want to hang out with these guys.
i'll meet you out front.
my lady has arrived.
not unless stifler's mom drives a moped.
fuckers, fuckers, fuckers.
take a number.
is that a fuckin' dress?
are you wearing a dress?
shitbreak, meet my little brother.
little brother, meet shitbreak.
my lady's not coming.
so my entire stockpile is wasted... and i look ridiculous!
excuse me.
i can't believe i finally got you alone.
that only took, what, six weeks?
so, are you alone too?
i'm all alone.
guess what i had in mind?
hey, marco, can you get your balls off me?
it's just my flatmates.
i guess this is kind of a lost cause, huh?
bye-bye.
jim, i got so tired of sightseeing.
but you're-- you're early.
i can stay here until then?
yeah.
i'm gonna be right back.
okay.
all right, i've got a plan.
"""hello, this is michele, my girlfriend."""
and obviously, nadia won't expect you to hop in the sack.
and then we break up the day of the party.
and you're all healed and back on the market.
you're evil.
i'm like cupid.
and i know how to make a girl jealous.
this is gonna be fun.
i'm sorry i didn't tell you sooner... but we just started seeing each other a few weeks ago.
but i'd really love it if you stayed here.
i think you should stay and have fun at the party.
good for you, jim.
of course i will stay.
she just loves my nipples.
no.
i'm fine.
i might have to actually go through with this.
what's the big deal with nadia, anyway?
i mean, okay... so she's 50,000 times hotter than most girls... but come on, it's just sex.
oh, no.
you saw the thing on the internet.
did it look like i might have had... a slight interest in nadia then?
add another year to that.
okay.
hey, why don't you bring nadia to the concert first?
it'll be a cool date.
we'll see how things go.
michele, you have been great.
thank you.
anytime.
come on.
you ready to break up?
you big, stupid dummy!
theatre is so cool!
i don't care if you are the best lay i've ever had in my life.
and i don't care if you did give me ten orgasms in a row... because you smell really bad.
i smell really bad!
so, don't you go being all super sexy guy any more... because i am now impervious... to your unrelenting machismo and sexual ardour.
we had something special.
vicki.
i'm so glad you came.
you want something to drink or--
can i help you?
that's my date.
you saved them all.
how sweet.
you don't think i'm a dork?
whatever you are, jim, it is what i like.
kevin left.
didn't look good.
kevin left?
just wandered down the beach.
you okay, kev?
wanna tell us what's up?
wanna feel finch's ass?
no, i went to say hi to vicky... and she was there with a date.
rule of three, oz.
you remember that day after prom?
you know, we made a toast to the next step.
i guess i never took it.
my brother said that by the end of the summer i'd see the big picture.
and i see it.
no matter what, times change and things are different.
the problem is, i don't want them to be.
you know, kevin, i haven't moved on either.
i got to find a new goddess.
it's gonna take patience, but i've been celibate all summer.
you kinda get used to it, though, huh?
are you insane?
look, kev, different does not necessarily mean worse.
as a matter of fact, i think things are just getting better.
or am i gonna have to drag your ass back to that party and prove it to you?
i'll walk.
you know, you have beautiful eyes.
that's a really nice top.
you're making an ass out of yourself.
you're ruining my mojo.
and you're not the stifmeister, okay?
it takes years to develop true stifmeister style.
all right.
gentlemen, this appears to be a party.
guys, if you'll excuse me, i'm gonna go look for nadia.
good luck.
so what was this year like for you?
did you miss high school?
well, no.
when you travel as much as i do, you get used to moving on.
but i have great memories.
yes.
yes, we can.
how romantic.
jim, come on.
it's beautiful!
cool!
jim, i have told you my memories from high school.
what are yours?
you.
you have not changed.
jim, relax.
we are just, how do you say, tooting our horns.
actually, that is quite difficult.
what do you mean?
well, this one time at band camp--
holy shit!
and i can't play anything at all.
so i totally sucked.
and everyone thought i was this petey guy... but i didn't know what to think, so i just kept playing and playing... and i didn't know what i was doing.
it was so funny!
please don't take this the wrong way... but you're-- you're everything that i used to want.
and as much as i may really... really regret what i'm about to do... there's somebody else i want to be with.
you want the band geek?
i just never joined the band.
you go get your geek.
someday i will find mine.
hey.
kevin myers.
sorry i was a dick before.
it's okay, man.
my name's brett.
can you give us a sec?
look, you don't have to do this.
maybe i was being selfish... in wanting to be your friend.
maybe it's just not gonna work.
i would much rather have you as a friend than not have you in my life at all.
party on!
what are you doing here?
i was gonna pick you up at the airport in two hours.
i took an earlier flight, and i thought i'd surprise you.
we'll get used to it.
steve, this cop-watch thing is horseshit.
hello?
man, this sucks.
who is it out there?
it's the stifmeister, baby.
i that so?
life's a bitch, isn't it?
i'm used to girls ignoring me.
or making fun of me.
"be the sherminator."""
i get it, okay?
maybe i am a geek.
whatever.
yes!
yes, you are!
all right.
i am the sherminator.
a sophisticated sex robot sent back through time... to change the future for one lucky lady.
i am lucky lady?
that's right, nadia.
you've been targeted for shermination.
come with me if you want to live.
help!
no fuckin' way!
cheers, bud.
hey, steve, look what i found.
good luck trying to break through that force field.
we never said that.
oh, man.
i will do anything-- anything-- to sleep with you chicks.
i'll grab every guy's ass in this room.
because i am comfortable with my sexuality.
oh, yeah.
at least have a drink with the stifmeister.
all right.
that's fair.
all right.
you truly are a stifmeister.
welcome back to the party.
steve, those are my lesbians.
ladies, i am down with the funky shit.
one time at this party, i was drinking champagne--
thank you.
thank you.
our next soloist will be michele flaherty.
petey?
this kid is killing me.
i'm a very special boy.
how's this for a band camp story?
come on, guys.
let's hear it for petey!
that untalented bastard.
we'll be back.
come on now, baby.
you know, there's only one word for that party.
later.
you drank him under the table.
he couldn't hack it.
best summer ever, huh, fellas?
absolutely.
i have all the time in the world.
so, are we gonna do this every summer?
well, we're gonna try.
how did you know i was here?
i called a couple of weeks ago.
didn't steven tell you that i was gonna drop by sometime?
i guess it slipped his mind.
what's your name?
jeanine.
there's a whole world out there.
i can't be obsessed with one woman.
good.
you want to get it on?
you better clear your schedule.
see you guys later.
give me, like, three days.
wait, was that who i think--
i think it was.
who the hell was that?
that was--
everything in.
yeah, i do.
yeah, i do.
let's go!
let's go!
where's shitbreak?
the movies.
wait a second.
who the fuck was in that car?
oh, finchy, i missed you.
oh, jeanine.
jeanine.
call me stifler's mom.
oh, stifler's mom!
i'm amazing.
i hate morphine addicts.
well, i... he... my friend isn't just a morphine...
there are pages missing.
bad borsch.
and then it's gone, lost without trace.
what is the point of having your own hospital if all you can find is cocaine.
i don't think it does.
you know there isn't.
mika, please.
thank you.
not to anna's bedroom.
to mine.
it was an accident.
honestly, these bolsheviks, they come in here, they treat the place like a hotel, they've no respect for other people's property.
in this case, the deep red of the blood spilled in the fight for freedom.
i must say, doctor, it shows tremendous courage to display this symbol with the white guard moments from the door.
of course you are.
i once, cut a leg off a girl called natasha.
tell me she had more than a injured shoulder.
oh, yes, yes, she fell in a lathe.
she was eight.
how many legs did this girl have?
although we did kill a horse, last week.
this is a hospital, not a summer retreat.
and what am i gonna talk to them about?
although for different reasons.
right now all you can think about is morphine.
you have to realize there's so much more to you than just morphine.
and you don't want to let pelageya down?
oh, thank you, but, that's the horse soup.
i'd call it a small hamper.
she cracked her skull open, on a gate post and died of a brain contusion.
once again, thank you for your kindness.
i haven't felt such warmth, since... since i sit and watched the bolsheviks burned down my childhood home.
i'm told you made this splendid hairpiece out of a dead horse.
matron, please, it is a buffet.
of whom?
extraordinary.
well, this is almost beyond fauvism so deceptively childlike.
this is exactly what you need.
good company, a bottle of wine.
oh, you wouldn't believe what we have to endure.
the last two weeks we've been to hell and back.
you didn't mean the town of hallenbeck in bavaria.
but war is unkind to the rigorous *cartiphiles,
sooner we can get out of this fetid cesspit the better.
people would tell you, you can only catch syphilis through sexual contact with an infected lesion.
you can actually infect a new born child in labor.
i'm sorry, that doesn't answer your question about syphilis.
i didn't ask about syphilis.
you'll love this.
oh, doctor, not the moscow quacks again.
i'll help you upstairs.
cause they took your morphine?
put the boy on the table.
feldsher, fetch the amputation saw.
whatever happens, don't pity me.
you're awake.
i just love ophelia song.
i feel terrible.
if i hadn't suggested you join the white guard, this would never have happened.
you had a terrible fever last night, you were hot and then cold, and hot and then cold again,
pelageya, i don't think it's appropriate for you to call me mika, in front of the others.
yes, doctor.
but you can't resign from love.
you want to end us.
i just said i loved you because i was on morphine, and i was only on morphine because you injected me.
i bid you good night, doctor.
you look so much better.
now we're even, doctor.
please, call me mika.
grigory, your brother?
i have it in emerald green, too.
"or if you prefer, this red is very ""in"" right now."
but this color is one i'd buy for any woman.
take eight of these and four of the ones i showed you earlier.
they'll be sold out before you even get them on the rack.
are you all right?
iole.
start with the business suit, please.
"and try keeping it ""smooth."""
but we should always remember that seeing each other again should be a celebration.
we must take advantage of our nonverbal language, make physical contact with our partner.
that is very enlightening, dr. silvestri.
let them bloom.
did you hear that?
know what my dream is?
i want to be a flight attendant.
you get paid to see the world.
don't waitresses get paid?
you just don't get it.
well, what's your dream then?
cuddling in front of the fire.
where's benedetto?
yes, do you want to try it on?
no, it's not like you can take it back.
what's with the hat?
guess.
the latest fashion?
and you didn't even...
isn't this going a little too far...
they're just kids.
i want a novel for my brother-in-law.
how old is he?
he must have a hobby.
i don't know.
well, that helps.
i have just what you're looking for.
it's a very captivating story.
already finished?
could you give me another?
four books in one week.
i wonder if you actually read them.
all right.
i know that one.
cecilia undresses and jumps in to get the pieces.
that was too easy.
ask me another one.
all right.
what mistake does robbie make when he's writing the letter to cecilia?
he doesn't write one, he writes two.
yes, that is very nice.
when does she say that?
perhaps you should read it again.
shall i find you another book?
that's why i'm here.
i think you'll like this.
is it about atonement as well.
does it have anything in common...
my sincerest apologies.
that's a very special book.
unfortunately his second book was disappointing.
gustavo?
of course we're meeting tonight.
isn't that what we planned?
what a day.
thanks.
serena said she drove you all over bilbao on her motorbike.
it's very nice.
gustavo, i haven't seen my daughter since christmas.
couldn't you be just a little more thorough for my sake?
she has lots of friends at the university.
she's doing great.
then what's wrong?
is it ines?
am i not good enough for you anymore?
very good, not at all or average?
tetrapak is cardboard packaging.
i'm listening.
mommy.
my boy, finally.
good news.
one of the local hairdressers is closing down.
he has seven helmet hairdryers just like you want.
he's giving me one.
you're the most wonderful son any mother could ask for.
my misfortune has led to fortune.
she figured it out.
figured what out?
that i don't have much time left.
mom, you really shouldn't give up.
did the nurse leave early today, too?
there's something i've been keeping inside all these long years.
what is it?
remember... when you used to play with those fabric cuttings as a child and i was always afraid that you'd swallow a pin?
how long could one stay in that position, if i may ask?
goodbye.
careful with the boneshaker, we've just painted the walls.
have you done the aerial view?
not yet.
try lowering it a little to highlight the volumes.
i'm on it.
sir, the fax from stubbekobing came in.
the entire delegation will be at the airport, including the mayor.
you'll be visiting two of the largest scandinavian velodromes.
hello?
speaking, who is this?
can't you tell me on the phone?
mr. d'avanzo?
romeo d'avanzo.
i'm torregiani.
please, have a seat.
what is this about?
my mother is waiting for you.
she is dying and her final request is to see you.
i've come to get you.
why me?
you because... she's your mother, too.
i didn't know until three hours ago, either.
you must have the wrong person.
thanks.
thanks.
her mother was a servant, and earned very little.
small town, fear of scandal.
so she was forced to give the child away.
but the regret has tortured her her whole life.
thoughts of her abandoned son haunted her dreams.
you mean he made it all up?
do you believe it?
no.
neither do i.
but he did get to me.
why me?
tell me about serena.
how is she?
she follows her mother's footsteps.
xavier perez, marine biology professor.
nice guy.
what's wrong?
why did that guy pick me?
do you remember when i was born?
of course i remember.
don't be ridiculous.
sorry, i can't talk right now.
what are you doing?
i'll tell you tomorrow.
should i lock the car?
i'll lock the car.
open the door.
come on!
eddy is a very special person.
then i leave in the morning when he gets back.
can't he get a job in a café during the day?
he's a night animal.
anyway, who drinks cocktails during the day?
weren't we keeping this until the end of the month?
mom bringing you home.
they had been on a trip, but i'm not sure.
i may have read it in a book.
why, what are you doing?
i'm working.
young werther is here for you.
who?
hello.
hello.
you can't have finished yesterday's book.
i started it but i can't seem to get into it.
you don't like it?
what can i do for you?
have dinner with me tonight.
i have a dance class tonight.
till when?
i'll gladly give you suggestions when you finish that book, but that's all.
is something wrong with me?
no, you're just fine as you are.
you think i'm too young, right?
you're a liar.
agata...
my sincerest apologies, but i have a problem.
i told you that edition is no longer in print.
she dies from smallpox?
"it might be ""nana."""
you're sure you don't have the one with the green cover?
yes, but i can paint one for you.
where were we?
excuse me...
pardon me?
where can i buy a bottle of butane gas?
you speak italian?
i don't remember much.
thank you very much, mrs. kierkegaard.
kierkegaard.
kierkegaard.
agata, hello.
don't you ever sleep?
so it's true, i was adopted.
what was that trip you mentioned?
i vaguely remember mom and dad going on a trip...
just a second.
where are you going?
what were you saying?
no, you were saying.
mom and dad took a trip and...?
i only remember when they came back and...
gustavo, hang on a minute.
agata.
i don't believe it.
and you never mention that you're married?
is it really that important?
just one, but he left.
there is something strange.
when do you get back?
okay, i'll call you tomorrow.
good night.
can i help you?
this is for me?
open it.
it's your father.
"""dear madam, this is my first and last letter."
please burn it immediately.
we've named him gustavo.
"benedetto torregiani, architect."""
the agreed sum?
350,000 liras.
it was worth much more back then.
daria, get the check book, please.
mother left 18,000 euros.
you are entitled to half.
do you need it?
because i do.
welcome back, my lord.
what's wrong?
i need to talk to you.
tell me.
your words shall be received like river water in a valley.
ines.
let me get acquainted with them all.
this is my father.
that's right.
let's start from the beginning.
he looks different.
i thought not.
350,000 liras...
it was worth much more back then.
180 euros or so.
they were always harsher with agata.
that explains her tendency to rebel.
have you told agata?
yes.
when?
the other day.
i knew it.
i should have known.
do you realize your behavior is a detriment to our intimacy?
i'm always the last to know things.
don't you see the efforts i make to keep our relationship from turning into dull routine?
what contribution do you make?
i know all about hardwood floors, but i know nothing of your most basic emotional processes.
dear madam, this is my first and last letter.
good evening.
we've named him gustavo to erase all signs of the past and to link his name to his grandfather.
good luck.
you called, sir?
post this immediately.
consider it done.
agata.
i'm not your sister anymore.
one month later
we moved to different cities, different homes.
i thought i'd miss her like crazy.
i got used to it so easily.
that's good, isn't it?
yes, but...
now gustavo never calls me.
when i call him, he answers in monosyllables.
i don't know how he's doing.
three years and three months.
what?
spain.
you lived there three years and three months.
i counted the days.
what do you mean?
don't say you never noticed.
don't worry, it's all water under the bridge.
can i ask you something?
why are you here?
what's wrong?
light bulbs burn out.
what do you mean?
i mean, when i walk by lights, the bulbs burn out.
how satisfied are you with the product?
very, not at all or average?
bianchina.
she's out of mourning.
no, i'll call you.
mr. rambone!
the wiring is fine.
i've changed three bulbs.
call me if you have a problem.
if we each focused on our own field, we'd do less damage to ourselves and everyone else.
that's so true.
very enlightening.
thank you.
goodbye.
everything fixed?
he flatly refuses to communicate with me.
he hasn't talked much to me, either, lately.
maybe he needs a little time alone.
he has a mistress then!
no.
am i like my mother at all?
when you bend over.
what?
i don't know.
that's all?
you don't talk much, but you ask a lot of questions.
romeo said you could get an operation.
why don't you?
did he ask you to convince me?
no, i was just curious.
i hope it's not because of money.
agata, i have some horrible news.
marisa kicked him out.
she'll only take him back if he stops drinking.
and with eddy's job, the place is full of alcohol.
i can't live like this.
what's wrong?
i think i'm in love.
your life is so full, and you find time to fall in love.
he's married.
and his wife is one of your friends?
no, i've only seen her once.
why?
adultery is committed with the wife's friend in 78% of cases.
he's 1 3 years younger.
i know what you're thinking.
when you're 60, he'll have just turned 47.
but don't worry about that.
in 96% of cases, people break up before then.
good night.
my eyes were closed.
were yours open?
"""the sky turns toward the east and shines vermilion red with the setting sun."
where night releases the day, where flowers produce unrelenting scents and the corollas are chalices for a revitalizing toast.
"serve between 18 and 21 degrees."""
what do you think?
nice.
down south?
i'm going to nard with the general manager on friday, to present the label to the winery.
i have to do inventory.
inventory?
read together in the bathtub.
when we wake up, when we swim, when we go for walks, at breakfast...
i came home at noon as usual.
that's why i think...
let's go to bed.
okay.
what kind of opinion have you formed about this?
can something like this really happen overnight?
the signs are always there.
it was a ritual.
what was hidden behind these acts of love?
what was hidden?
nothing.
will you bring me jam in bed tomorrow morning?
of course i will.
but i'll spread it all over you.
sir, i consider it my duty to inform you of the situation at the torregiani architect office.
the bilbao boutique awaits your authorization for the flooring.
it's been 46 years since i was hired by that good man, your father, when he arrived from his hometown.
my best wishes.
sir, in my opinion, we should take the bull by the horns.
what do you suggest?
my granddaughter has just opened a detective agency.
have her try to find your father.
how are the guys at work?
they insisted on coming with me.
they'd really appreciate a sign from you.
we'll keep our fists clenched, sir.
we shall resist.
the lord is closest to those who suffer.
be strong.
this will ease the pain.
sister, tell me the truth.
they'll amputate, won't they?
you must be strong, my son.
sister!
quick, bed 22!
life can be cruel...
fight it, you can do it.
lamberto will be here soon.
my time has come.
rosa, remember the promise you made me.
since i can't... anymore...
i hate to think how much i've traveled over the years.
but you've had some nice encounters.
some bad ones too, believe me.
what are you going to do?
other people's free time, not mine.
this is the piece i told you about.
you're not a model, so to speak.
in fact, i have an idea.
since you are an architect, you could help with the trout farm.
think over it, brother.
i'm going up to marinella's to talk about some things.
here's another idea.
basically, you're my brother and an architect.
i can just see it.
"""the trout ranch."""
you like it?
we'll talk about it.
are you free?
good evening.
yes.
i think i killed someone.
i don't know.
two cars crashed at a junction.
can i come in?
yes.
but you have to calm down and tell me what happened.
i've missed you.
i know nothing about myself.
i caused a crash.
i have no self-control.
i'm always picking the wrong men.
and light bulbs keep fizzling.
how about dinner in a nice restaurant?
romeo has taken care of it.
besides, i have nothing to wear.
what size are you?
you never said we had a sister like this... so to speak.
agata, romeo.
how do you do?
how do you do?
thanks for the dress.
pink certainly suits you!
thanks.
you don't look that much alike.
we have different fathers.
that makes a difference.
all i know about him is that he's held a pitchfork before.
i never have.
i had to wait until i was 40 to hold a chicken.
i have a son.
to agata.
to agata.
right foot... left foot...
no, forget it.
he talked more tonight than in the whole previous month.
i own a book store.
no, not at all.
i would have imagined something else, like...
is it tiring running a book store?
kind of.
but it's what i've always wanted to do, my trout farm.
a book farm!
have you had it long?
five years.
five years?
i bet you've read a lot of books.
i bet you were reading when he was four and not talking.
do you remember every book you've read?
no, you only remember the parts that moved you the most.
sometimes images, sometimes the characters.
or the emotions.
other times you can't tell the difference between what you read and what really happened.
as if it was all one big book.
i read a book once, too.
basically, i don't remember anything.
images, characters, emotions.
i remember the hero.
i remember riding my grandpa's pig to imitate him.
you haven't read anything else?
here.
you don't need it?
good night.
good night.
goodbye.
finished?
"""if personality is an uninterrupted series of completed acts, then there was something wonderful about him."
a sharpened...
another idea came to me as i was reading last night.
a dance hall.
instead of everyone going home at night, the lights come on, the music starts and the dance begins.
no, with the trout.
we have to broaden the offer.
it's part of the game.
can you dance?
so, shall we make our dance hall?
i can see it there.
over here.
we could set up a nice bowling ground over there.
we could build two ziggurats.
mesopotamian towers...
people will see them from afar.
okay.
basically, being ruthless wouldn't be appropriate.
did you know i lived in granada?
how did you end up there?
his name was ramón.
he had an estate and made olive oil.
serena's father.
the professor.
she got bored.
and waited for a man to come take her away.
i'm lucky, i got one.
i was living in the sticks when romeo came to get me.
he was working in a pastry shop and was sick of doughnuts.
are you being ruthless, too?
get my mind off it, let's rumba.
sister, you're an endless source of surprises.
get off.
is it ines?
the mayor of stubbekobing.
the velodrome?
if she asks me about it, i won't know what to say.
i've decided to go into business with romeo.
really?
since when?
since now.
have you ever seen cyclists balancing on their bikes with their feet on the pedals?
i've been feeling like that for weeks now.
just waiting for the right moment to take off.
i'm glad you've taken off.
agata,
i'll always be your brother.
good morning, giovanni.
i've been calling your cell.
serena has been wondering what happened to you.
and then there's young werther.
i've never seen someone so totally desperate.
and my father was hit by a car friday.
at the crossroads round the corner.
at 3:00?
it's my fault.
it's my fault he was hit.
it wasn't even his fault.
the traffic light went berserk.
no, it's his fault.
i'm the only one who missed out.
what's going on?
ask your blonde bombshell.
what blonde bombshell?
you and that blonde.
agata, what are you talking about?
will you tell me?
agata.
you were kissing her, and she had her hand on your ass.
i haven't been around there since i helped my grandma move.
no, i don't want to see you again.
starting the unsold inventory?
he is very perceptive and has diagnostic abilities.
i feel so bad about your father.
can i see him to see how he's doing?
he's bandaged up like a mummy.
look on the bright side.
he can't drink.
that dress is just stunning.
romeo gave it to me.
it's nice.
will you turn that lamp on?
denying it is futile.
i have witnesses, friday afternoon
can you?
be rational.
one second and i will.
agata, it wasn't me.
agata, i love you.
agata!
some people have to work tomorrow.
like caterpillar to butterfly.
when energy big, really want out.
important always leave door open.
important.
count ten.
like dishwashing gloves?
heavy duty.
now you think,
"""my number one problem light bulb."""
many people in world make light bulb pop.
but not many people can command light bulb to go off.
you not yet ready.
mr. rambone, listen to me.
it's yours, but first sign this damn...
let me count it.
how about this...
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10...
who is this?
dad.
dad!
he's my dad!
something tells me you're romeo.
maria libera.
you like sad books, too?
well, you know...
"""we beat on, boats against the current..."""
it stays with you.
are you ready for another one?
"""ivanhoe."""
yeah.
where's gustavo?
he's busy until tomorrow morning.
if your invitation still stands...
can you help me?
so he's not deaf.
of course not.
listen, sister.
i've been thinking...
could i have seen gustavo's wife somewhere before?
dr. silvestri?
dr silvestri is my sister-in-law.
why didn't you tell me before?
i must tell daria straight away.
conservatives win in denmark local elections
can i help you?
same to you.
mr. torregiani here?
no, he doesn't live here.
i know, he's out of town.
like inside easter eggs.
easter egg?
no, no easter egg.
what about benedetto's school?
i doubt he'll miss his classmates.
cicognara.
act like a father for once.
no, not whenever i want!
do you like that painting?
it would be perfect for my dance hall.
do you like it?
have you seen the title?
you modeled for it?
i painted it.
what do you say...
congratulations.
has that big fish hypnotized you?
hi, i'm delfina.
agata.
weren't you the one who worked with crocodiles?
you could say you've moved from still water to the open sea.
hello.
i've been expecting you.
"""the individual in question goes by the name of arduino sassini."
thank you, but i've already found my father.
if i'm no longer needed...
when would you like me there?
it's a shame, so to speak.
it was perfect for the dance hall.
listen, i have to go now.
i'm sorry.
we're fine.
yes, he told you?
did you get the book?
just a second.
thanks for everything.
you're still here?
where's your brother?
brother... he left.
god, he's a weird one.
would you like some coffee?
did you sleep well?
is he dead?
here are the light bulbs.
i brought the hairdryer, too.
thanks.
can you see to this, too?
if it falls within my field of competence, i'd be glad to.
two werthers.
after you.
do you admit that may 16 at around 3:00, you were crossing the intersection around the corner from here?
i do.
do you admit you were accompanied by a 23-year-old blonde female, cinzia bonicatti, with whom you have a relationship?
now do you believe me?
if i'm no longer needed...
i'll be going.
let's take it from the top.
now follow me.
music, please.
i don't want to listen to reason.
there's no need, i told you.
you fell over on the floor.
i'm fine now, really.
you are not fine, believe me.
i'd much rather stay with you.
we could have gone down south and fallen even more in love.
then you'd say you wanted to leave your wife.
she'd fall at your feet crying and you'd get second thoughts.
you'd say you couldn't leave her because she'd taken barbiturates.
then, when you kissed me, a tidal wave pulled me out to sea.
my name is arturo vitale.
i've never been down south.
i don't have a dog.
the door.
lesson three.
what a surprise.
pernille margarethe.
pernille margarethe.
oh, come on!
what happened?
maria libera.
thank you for coming to save us.
what happened?
everything blew.
what do you mean?
maybe you should sit at the wheel of your roadster, so to speak.
i wasn't paying attention or something.
i got off with a broken arm.
daria lost the use of her legs.
and we both lost the baby.
but that's just how i am.
i love daria with all my heart.
basically, i think i am what i am.
if i'm messed up, i was four years ago and i am now.
i do the same things i've always done.
the same stupid things, so to speak.
i can't seem to feel guilty about it.
well, the horn works.
that's a good sign.
christmas crackers.
can we go tonight, too?
you have school tomorrow, kid.
whose idea was it to put in an art gallery?
they can't go in the bookstore.
and tell him the bookstore can't go next to the kiosk.
yes, the velodrome project was wonderful.
it wasn't even finished.
so you're going to handle outside communication?
is that what romeo said?
i think so, too.
you'd be perfect.
isn't she the one who gets burned alive?
yeah, but don't worry.
ivanhoe comes and saves her.
i am terribly fond of these colors.
you have good taste.
it's a choice you pay for.
wow.
just focus on the pins, just the pins.
i found my butane gas.
bianchina.
pernille margarethe.
yes.
no, i mean... where have you been all these years?
i'll get the skewers.
want some coffee?
he was everything to me.
i know.
he had faults, but i liked everything about him.
something to drink, ma'am?
thank you.
thank you.
like crazy.
know what, arturo?
i was starting to miss you, too.
i'm going to the toilet.
what did you two say?
you know what i'll miss most about tokyo?
oh shit.
did i use a rubber?
how the hell should i know?
what are you doing?
i have to see if...
i have to check!
jesus!
give me a hand.
what are we looking for?
no, i can't tell.
7 years and 9 months later
"""who are you?"" -""i am death."""
how's your article coming along?
okay, i guess.
what does our scholar say?
carnival, guys.
bakhtin writes that rabelais transposes   the structure of the carnival, turning everything upside down.
reason just disappears.
the body takes over.
can you feel it, norwegian bastards, can you sense the smell of genius?
the mind sparkle, the body tingle?
and what, in reality, are we witnessing?
we are here.
we are there.
we are participants.
participating in the celebration   of the huge, bewildering plurality of organic life.
we become children.
we become children again.
for we are newborn.
the proustian body is famous...
can't i just pop a pill or something?
no, i'm afraid we need your blood.
klepp.
so what do you do, mr. klepp?
i'm a literary science student.
i'm writing my graduate thesis on proustian onomastics.
uh, marcel proust.
i'm writing on him.
will i know the result immediately?
congratulations.
bloody hell!
how many kids do i have out there?
i don't want anything to do with that kid.
forget it.
klepp, klepp, klepp.
it'll be okay.
birte, beate.
little trine with her pacifier.
been to the movies?
does it bother me?
no!
right, a daughter.
seven years old?
jesus.
one day you sealed the tomb of a ninth-grader.
he means her pussy.
you're seventeen, drink, read bukowski, dig rock.
you've got no idea who you are.
hasse, please?
please?
so you fuck anette hansen from sola's brains out while she's asleep...
so to speak...
you don't know what you've left her, but know you've been a bad boy...
okay, hasse!
i'm just trying say that there's some logic to your life, jarle klepp.
"yes. ""for all is different from what you believe."""
"""what i believe."
"""secrets conceal themselves,"" jarle."
it'll be okay, buddy.
i have to get back home.
you should reconsider.
jesus!
look at him.
he's a fucking dad!
and you...
jarle.
hey, gothenburg...
a man of your talent, get it?
give it all to your talent.
i've got a kid in skien.
skien, malmö, costa del sol, -
stamsund, gothenburg, berlin, fårö.
hi, jarle.
it's time for you to stand up and be a man.
and it's time you met your daughter.
she'll arrive in bergen at 1 1 :45 a.m. on 6 september.
the ticket's bought and paid for, so there.
yours, anette.
feelings are so global.
i don't know.
even though it's far away, it touches me.
and i really loved what he said.
mom, i can't find my pokemon cards.
did you hear the ruckus in the block last night?
that's global.
hey, are you heading out to the airport as well?
i'm picking up my grandchild.
the essence of life.
life is meaningless until you have children.
i'm a student.
have no time for kids.
"""she'll arrive in bergen at 2:45 p.m. on 8 september."""
will the following passengers please proceed to gate 22:
torger johanson and martin kristiansen.
you must be charlotte isabel?
darling, i can't follow you all the way home to daddy.
right.
i'm like... your dad.
so how was your flight?
charlotte isabel?
and what do you have in this huge suitcase?
bloodthirsty crocodiles?
my presents.
right.
your birthday's coming up.
is it thursday or friday?
exactly.
right now i'm writing my graduate thesis on proustian onomastics.
which means i'm writing sort of an article on a new biography   about the great french poet and writer marcel proust.
marcel proust.
marcel proust.
good.
the university.
but what do they do here?
do they make anything?
well, what they do...
do they fix stuff?
daddy!
can't you even turn on the tv by yourself?
well, there you go.
but mom says he's a jerk, because he loves someone called camilla.
look at that guy.
it's really sad that she died.
it's the media pressure, charlotte isabel.
hey, look!
have you seen it?
"""e.t. phone home!"""
why do they call her the people's princess?
because people like her, i guess.
but are there any princesses people don't like?
well, that's a good question.
so what does your mom do, charlotte isabel?
you can call me lotte if you like.
works at the supermarket.
like a checkout clerk?
she's really good at it.
now stop nagging.
is this my room?
yeah.
you can sleep here.
there's marcel proust, on the desk.
i want to go home.
i want my mommy.
we can buy some sweets, seeing it's saturday.
don't you want your saturday treat?
how long do i have to be here, anyway?
are you going to start stocking the morning post?
look, a tamagotchi.
mom never lets me have one.
but all my friends have them.
you can't always get what you want.
you can have this if you like.
what about some sweets?
bye.
don't you have any dance music?
don't you ever let up?
hey?
you've got to do one thing at a time.
you've got the tv on.
you can't start dancing around as well.
"""cause i get dumber daily, juba, juba,""   ""dancing in the mirror..."""
when do you usually go to bed?
when i want.
so, like,   after you go to bed, does mom have her friends come by for some beer?
can i put the sticker on the mirror?
i don't want that sticker on the mirror.
all set for a good night's sleep.
humpelfinkel!
my comfort toy.
listen, i'm not like other dads.
you can't sit here.
well, she was shouting your name.
don't spit in the stairway.
i mean, i know her...
herdis' little fucker.
sorry about all this.
good night, grete.
not so fast.
let me help you out of this.
i'll take it.
lotte, go back to bed.
come on, let's go.
that's right.
okay, let's see...
one day she was out riding her horse on the plains.
she fell off the horse and died.
but daddy...
so there was a funeral.
but then...
suddenly there was a sound.
a sound?
a creaking sound.
she ran out into the forest - and was free.
but daddy, i didn't like that she didn't want to be a princess.
you'll discover that you won't like a lot of things about life.
daddy?
is it huge?
yeah, it's really enormous!
right.
but these penguins are real.
they eat fish and stuff.
daddy!
we're going to a great big aquarium!
yeah, they've got penguins there.
i tried to tell you yesterday.
have you got any more secrets?
it may come as a bit of a surprise.
it's not real gold.
i'm just a student, after all.
i'll take a shower, then we'll see the aquarium.
is she your girlfriend, daddy?
penguins!
but are penguins birds or fish?
but they can't fly.
they're still birds.
no, i don't feel like it.
what's eating you?
yeah, what's eating you?
smoking can kill you, you know.
well, i'm not gonna die today.
one, two, three!
look at me, herdis.
i'm not cut out for this.
i'm not cut out to be a father.
one week, then i'm done.
i don't want a daughter.
no.
hey...
last night, yesterday evening, -
i went out with robert.
gothenburg.
robert...
has strong feelings for me.
and i...
i've grown very fond of him.
i told him about us last night, yesterday evening.
and he...
well, i don't know how to put it.
but i think i   want to be with him.
you've been awesome, really.
stop it.
walk like this, daddy!
daddy says you're his girlfriend.
you're just a feminist slut!
i know this is sort of short notice.
but a friend of mine has suddenly fallen seriously ill.
i wondered if you could babysit my daughter for a few hours?
yeah, i have a daughter.
she's really sweet.
i mean, i was like standing there, reading the letter.
the world just fell apart before my eyes.
so i went to the airport.
she arrived with a sign saying:
"""i travel alone""."
we all do.
poetic, hasse.
just trying to get through.
she's got the most innocent look in her eyes, a tiny rucksack   and a soft toy named humpelfinkel.
does she wet her bed?
no, she's almost eight.
yeah, it's actually quite common.
it's easy to...
what does herdis think?
is she happy about being a mom?
oh, herdis just loves kids.
jesus.
jarle, i...
holy shit, i'm sorry.
hey, where are you going?
oh, shit!
let's go home.
forget it.
you're a fucking professor of literature!
jarle?
what's he doing here?
what the hell are you playing at?
you goddamn swedish cocksucker!
find an old hag your own age!
take it easy, jarle.
you need to rub your prick on our women to come?
then björn borg turns up!
jarle, grete called.
right.
so you can't even have a beer without everyone going apeshit.
well, this is just peachy.
of course you drive a volvo, robert.
i take it you're having kids soon?
imagine, herdis...
herdis?
hey...
oh god.
where have you been?
i was worried last night.
when i think about it,   it was one of the most brilliant things i've seen in my entire life.
that scene with herdis and robert, it had real italian flair, get it?
absolutely brilliant.
it's a whole new era, jarle.
and i've met charlotte isabel.
all she cared about was how you were feeling.
it just dropped out of her.
the only thing that bothers me now, is this anette hansen.
sends her kid to a virtual stranger and goes on vacation.
she's a supermarket clerk.
this is fucking proletarian, jarle.
it's the goddamn call of the wild reaching into our lives!
where's lotte?
grete took her along to work.
should i go and fetch her?
you certainly should.
did you have fun?
go to your daddy.
i don't know what your twisted brain's been up to.
but never pull a stunt like that on me or your daughter again!
okay, come on.
it's not the end of the world.
thanks for helping out, grete.
tasty?
so what did you do today, lotte?
but what's wrong with you, daddy?
but are you always sick like that?
falling down, stumbling, throwing up?
that was just because i was drunk.
you get drunk if you drink too much alcohol.
you know, beer and so on.
anyway, lotte, the reason why i came home that late last night,   is because i was drunk.
i had a life before you arrived.
with my friends, at the university, out on the town.
and aunt herdis.
well, aunt herdis has got a new boyfriend now.
aren't you friends anymore?
the point is that this isn't a good time for you to come and visit me.
i don't have anywhere else to stay.
you want me to go home?
no.
try to eat something, okay?
would you like to come and see where daddy works?
okay, but you're not supposed to bring kids to where i work.
so you have to be quiet as a mouse.
quiet as a mouse.
your job is to be invisible.
i've never said so, and if i did...
sweet lotte at the university?
who's he?
do i have even more uncles?
we're just picking up some articles.
daddy, may i have some ice cream?
ice cream?
sun ice?
hurry up.
we can't hang around here all day.
hi, my little darling!
kind of dense in here.
even though you're dating an old fart.
are you there?
yeah.
i just called to say i'm sorry.
it's been too much for me.
jarle, you don't have to say it.
hi.
hi.
who are you?
hi.
how old are you?
i'll be seven on thursday.
but who are you?
seems i'm your grandma.
my grandma?
but i had no idea you were such a big, beautiful girl.
i thought you were just a little baby.
i'm the third tallest girl in my class.
when did you come?
so who's herdis?
she called and told me about charlotte isabel.
aunt herdis, of course.
much better than the day daddy was sick.
sick?
he was drunk.
okay.
it was at a party in 1989.
yeah.
sorry, was it the first time you...?
mom...
yes?
right, do we have to talk about it?
you're a father now.
where's your mom, charlotte?
she's on vacation with my father.
i've got a note with a phone number.
whose phone number?
yeah, if i fall ill or break a leg or something.
have you always known about your daddy in bergen?
no, they only told me last monday.
if i'd known, i'd have come here sooner.
did you reach her aunt and uncle?
metaphorically touching, you might say.
sorrow and projection.
you just transfer whatever ails you, unable to face your own tragedy.
the human need to cry, the nietzschian...
jarle, cut out the crap.
"""metaphorically touching""."
jarle!
jarle, please listen to what i'm saying.
you're a grown man of twenty-five!
tomorrow you spend real time with her, the two of you alone!
can you babysit him?
can you babysit him?
so we'll see you at the museum this afternoon, jarle?
what?
so that's settled, then?
goodbye.
shall we sit down?
here.
there's something i want to say to you.
you know, i'm really pleased to be your grandma.
and i'd like you to know that it's perfectly okay if you're sad.
and you don't have to talk about it.
but if there's anything you'd like to know or talk about,   you can tell me.
yeah.
the proustian body is famous, it's senses...
okay, time to see the museum of geography.
come on, lotte!
i got a lot done today, like.
i'm trying to restructure the whole thing.
you need to trust that others will find the pattern interesting.
but i have to get through to people who know less about proust than i do.
well, i don't know.
i'm sort of my own editor, you know.
well, you already have a target group for your paper in...
but...
but if you get it published, we have to celebrate.
she's been gone for ages.
lotte?
lotte, open up.
come out, lotte.
lotte?
lotte!
attention all passengers:
the train to oslo is expected to arrive on track 2 shortly.
i've been searching for you all over town.
go away, daddy.
you don't want me here.
i'm not kidding!
i don't want to!
no, i don't want to!
let go.
what on earth is going on?
want to join me, lotte?
pretty big puzzle.
where do you think that piece fits?
there.
there's a whole lot of green here.
i have a friend called kathrine.
she...
her parents are divorced.
and i think mom and dad might be getting divorced.
okay.
that one goes there.
not bad.
you've got far.
i don't know if i'm any good at this.
like this one.
where does it go?
know what i used to sing for dad?
"""i know a wondrous garden, where pretty roses burst."""
"""god made it as a present""   ""for every child on earth."""
he was just like you are.
anybody want rolls?
yes please.
i'm sorry.
i was so worried about you.
but you were stupid.
i just can't finish my stupid article   for the morning post.
you know what day it is tomorrow?
you do.
i've got a surprise for you.
hi, jarle.
it's been a while.
well, we're laying a jigsaw puzzle.
hey...
darling.
like...
i've been worried sick about you.
i've tried to call you a thousand times.
i had to get back in time for your birthday.
i don't want you here.
lotte?
darling.
hey?
you're not mad cause mom's here?
want more stories about the princess who didn't want to be a princess?
i want mommy to come.
anette, she...
what shall we do, jarle?
should we contact the child welfare services?
well, i really mean it.
seven years you kept her from us.
so that's your excuse for sending her off to a complete stranger?
i had to send lotte away.
why didn't you say anything?
it's been seven years!
excuse me, but you have no idea.
of course he'd have kept the child.
wouldn't you, jarle?
may i come in?
this isn't a good time.
are you busy?
hey, jarle?
i've been thinking...
jarle?
have you seen my bag?
yeah, it's here.
herdis is one of my friends from the university.
i'll go and check on lotte.
okay.
herdis?
herdis!
we're having a birthday party tomorrow.
for lotte.
and?
i'd really like you to come.
humpelfinkel isn't that scary.
everyone who'd seen humpelfinkel so far had been so scared, their eyes   rolled all the way down to their toes!
but the princess didn't think he was scary at all.
a real princess.
lotte?
forgive me.
i don't know, lotte.
i just wanted to fetch humpelfinkel.
he's lying there.
what are you writing, anyway?
i'm trying to describe what's so great about marcel proust.
why not just write that he's your friend?
sure.
that's what i'm trying to do, but it sounds silly.
it's the morning post, you know.
they only publish the very best.
are you scared of the morning post?
mom says that as long as i'm myself,   nobody can tell me i'm stupid.
she's right.
you think i should just send it now?
yes.
come here.
up there.
there.
now hurry off to bed.
good night!
likewise.
have you been out jogging?
hi, jarle.
sorry i slapped you.
i'm really a pacifist.
but you have to realize   that you can't hand your child to a stranger the day after she arrives.
then get drunk, fight with your ex and turn up like that.
well, i didn't know what to come up with.
i was completely blank.
then i came home one evening, and found a book by bakhtin.
the guy with the polyphonic novel.
"know what ""poly"" means?"
one.
mom?
leaving her to go get drunk the day she arrived...
how could you?
isn't a carnival a good idea?
bakhtin...
you think i could have done such a thing to you?
right, but it was thanks to bakhtin that i cooked it up.
he demonstrated how the carnival is liberating.
it exults the low and dethrones the high.
perfectly ordinary people hold birthday parties for their kids.
they don't need to study philosophy to dress up and amuse them.
look at this.
they've never heard about bakhtin.
jarle...
happy birthday!
happy birthday.
it's beautiful!
thanks a lot!
even more guests?
see who it is.
well, i don't know...
you don't know?
i found this wig...
you're the world's greatest sorcerers.
this is mindbogglingly pathetic.
what's wrong with my costume?
look who's here!
very well.
mother, mom, mother of all things, earth mother, moomin mother...
hi, i'm robert gothenburg.
i've taken a dip in the sea of eros myself at times.
we met in the stairs.
i'd cleaned them, you see.
1 ,2,3,4,5,8,7,8,9,10, 1 1 ,12,13,14,15,18,17,18,19... 90, 91 , 92, 93...
oops, sorry.
yeah, but...
anette, over here!
come out, come out, wherever you are!
great spot.
no, i'm the one who should apologize.
you call that hiding?
i haven't been on any vacation.
but you probably figured that out?
hey, let's forget about all that and be mature about it.
yeah.
i think we have to wait a minute before... because...
jesus.
i feel i have to say a few words.
this hasn't been just any week, right?
dear lotte...
one day charlotte isabel hansen turns up here, in our little world.
she lands like a grain of pollen.
i, and many others here besides me,   live a life that seems incomprehensible to many.
you don't have to answer, because i know what you think.
you pity me.
you think i'm a lonely whale in deep darkness, right?
because it may be true.
saturday night, when i brought a wrecked, noisy jarle home,   before that evening, these thoughts i'm talking about now   had never even entered my mind.
the point is that everything that's happened this past week,   is perfectly okay.
because we know you.
we know jarle klepp, right?
a great talent who immerses himself in what he loves.
jarle klepp is   a human being.
and so am i.
this used to be my favourite present.
chocolate!
okay, you've got to open both these at the same time.
happy birthday.
two tamagotchies!
well, honey.
there's one left.
who's it from?
you know who it's from.
you got it before we left.
it's from your father.
lotte?
come out to mommy.
i want to talk to daddy.
right.
are you there, lotte?
hey, you...
shall i open it for you?
isn't it nice?
"it says ""lotte""."
i'm afraid daddy's going to leave us.
well, he might.
but you can still visit him.
you'll see him again.
but doesn't mommy love daddy anymore?
no, i guess she doesn't, but...
she's still fond of him.
but i love him.
yeah.
so you'll get to see him again.
he won't disappear completely.
it'll be okay.
hey?
shall we put that sticker in the middle of the mirror?
there.
one, two, three, four...
i can feel a tingle spreading from my tummy
think i've had too much to eat
every day's another dream, cause this will be so yummy
knutsen has got jitters in his feet
cause i get dumber daily, juba, juba
dancing in the mirror dumber daily, but it's okay
juba, juba
should we do something about the tamagotchies?
yeah, they'll die without attention.
i'll take the blue one.
i don't get it.
like, what's the point?
i guess they're   supposed to grow old or something before they die.
will i kill it if i feed it too much?
this is a bit...
this is sort of odd, in a way.
last time i saw you was in 1989.
now we're sitting here.
it was some night.
oh?
i've always remembered your face.
you have?
it was nice.
you had that hungry look.
hush.
lotte might hear us.
got a rubber?
uh...
try to pull out?
okay, stand still.
"okay, say ""cheese""."
there.
oh, i'm so pleased to have met you!
and we'll meet again, cause i'm your grandma.
right?
lotte!
well, i guess this is goodbye.
so what happens next?
i don't know.
we'll have to keep in touch.
i don't know how much of a father you think you can be, but...
would you like to have one of my tamagotchies?
you decide.
isabel.
thanks a lot.
we'll talk later.
yeah.
i love you, daddy!
i love you too, lotte!
i must have hit the wrong button.
¿ and she's loving him with that body, i just know it ¿
¿ l've been funny, i've been cool with the lines ¿
the neighbors will think someone has had a heart attack.
not really.
i had forgotten that i'd given the key to another agent, and she's showing it to her husband.
hey, kimmy!
not so bad except for the incredibly horrible date that i'm on right now.
this has nothing to do with you and me, anne.
chris, everything has to do with you and me.
it was mostly a one-sided conversation.
[ laughs ] i was just telling chris here i'm giving up my existence as a neglected housewife to become a full-time hoochie-coochie dancer.
caddying for your father is such a great way for the two of you to get to know each other.
you feed them caribou and blueberries, and then you push them out of the nest, and you just hope they don't go splat on the sidewalk like a turkey falling out of a helicopter.
you know, it's funny -- all the time that we've been neighbors, i thought i knew everything about you.
unless you feel the need to fuck old high-school sweethearts forever.
i can't take it anymore.
¿ make like a mist or milquetoast ¿
look, no -- l know i fucked up, okay?
it's up to you if you want to carry them inside you or strapped onto your back.
i guess the key is not to let one prevent you from experiencing the other.
as angry as i may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge...
if you're lucky, an angel will come into your life and rescue you from your fear.
good-bye, counselor.
lily, i promise i won't ruin your party.
i'll be charming and convivial.
well, all right, since you asked.
i'm starting up a business cultivating all-organic, artisanal honey.
that's right, i'm a job creator.
where are you doing this exactly?
kids, someday you're gonna throw a party, and you might find yourself worrying if something's gonna go wrong.
what you should worry about is everything going wrong.
and what's really scary is how quickly that can happen.
at lily and marshall's housewarming party for instance, it only took five minutes.
oh, gosh, what are you as busy as?
are... you... a... vegan?
"and when you were shoveling the spring rolls down your gullet, did you happen to notice a little sign next to the plate marked ""vegan""?"
young man, are you suggesting fisticuffs... as in with our fists?
i will bite and scratch you like a wolverine.
like... ships and lake monsters.
i got a basement full of bees, and ted almost got into a fight with mr. cootes.
okay, maybe it's not a total disaster.
i think we can agree there's something here.
something big... that looks and probably feels real.
i mean, i think it's time that somebody took him aside and told him this is not how you treat your staff.
mini pizzas, bacon-wrapped figs, pigs in blankets.
you know, like you do to strangers on the street at the slightest provocation.
i'm not the type of person to be driven crazy by a host who refuses to provide delicious hot mustard in which to dip my pigs in blankets!
"well, the bees escaped their enclosure, but no reason to ""bee"" concerned."
every 30 seconds, there's another crisis that needs to be dealt with and i have to deal with it.
and i don't know if i can handle a life that's just one crisis after another.
if i would've left things in your dainty, lily-white, never-ripped- an-old-lady's-wig-off hands, we would be kugel-free right now.
i would rather be nice than be like you, always getting in fights about stuff that's not even worth fighting about.
marshall, look, i know when you started with this firm, it was all fun and games.
we're so great together.
i want to spend every minute of every day with you.
i never let you out of my sight for one second.
oh, god!
i mean, what?
let's just say, the punishment fit the crime.
i can't wait to tell everybody that we're boyfriend and girlfriend!
let's do it tonight.
or maybe something...
this is insane.
what am i thinking?
i can do this.
i'm as good as the next guy.
next.
what are you singing?
"""willkommen""?"
of course.
give me your name, tell me something about yourself.
dennis hofferman.
um...
i'm just a cabdriver.
i've never really sang in public before.
that's fine.
¢ü willkommen, bienven... ¢ü
sorry.
butterflies.
you know what?
no, wait a minute, wait a minute.
why don't you just turn around, face the back of the stage?
no prying eyes.
¢ü willkommen, bienvenue, welcome ¢ü
¢ü fremde, etranger, stranger ¢ü
¢ü gluklich zu sehen ¢ü
¢ü je suis enchante ¢ü
¢ü happy to see you bleibe, reste, stay ¢ü
¢ü willkommen, bienvenue, welcome ¢ü
tell him we're minutes away, for pete sake.
dennis?
and now!
take it that's not a prop.
no, it's a real live .38.
mrs. gardener had bought the furniture used, a few years ago.
there was an unsolved murder there in 2002, place shut down.
this was the dresser from the set of fraulein schneider's boardinghouse.
actor went out for a smoke before the show, was shot and killed with a .38.
wallet was missing and there'd been a series of holdups in the area.
we need to go back and look at actors, crew, whoever else was inside.
"¢ü ""life is a cabaret, old chum."" ¢ü"
"¢ü ""come to the cabaret."" ¢ü"
i hate musicals.
victim is denise hofferman.
35, cabdriver.
one of the most dangerous jobs there is, and the guy gets shot doing a musical.
was killed opening night, before the curtain even went up.
that part of francisville had a string of holdups, same m.o.
one shot to the chest, close range, wallet gone.
there was a fiance, gloria hill.
let's talk to her first, see if dennis was having trouble with anyone there.
dennis was the sweetest guy i ever knew.
we were real happy.
about to set a wedding date, too.
you two meet here?
my family owns the place.
was my leading man right here in the garage.
he saw the sign driving by.
said it was like a siren went off in his head.
week later, he auditioned.
how'd he get along with the group there?
there was some trouble right from the beginning.
what kind of trouble?
so i have a question.
cliff is just some sucker who walks around and watches everybody.
then that clinton had to ruin it for him.
he didn't mention it again, and i thought things got better.
oh, too bad, i make a mean one.
we've got some questions about dennis hofferman.
i'm buried here.
show's gonna start soon, and i got to serve people.
hey, you wouldn't want to lose your job.
criminal record of yours could make it hard to find work.
that's a cheap shot, man.
that theft charge is from way back.
i was messed up, yeah.
but that was before i got with the theater, got off the street.
that place turned my life around, put me on a solid path.
i'm a family man now.
problem is, we know someone from inside killed dennis.
and you're the only one with a rap sheet.
so, please, sir.
¢ü if you run into my mama ¢ü
¢ü don't reveal my indiscretion ¢ü
¢ü give a working girl a chance... ¢ü
¢ü hush up, don't tell mama shush up ¢ü
¢ü don't tell mama don't tell mama, whatever you do... ¢ü
i think my cross messed you guys up.
found a whole new thing i'm awful at.
dancing in heels.
line, please!
if you had a secret, you bet i would keep it.
¢ü i would never tell on you ¢ü
you think it's cute, that you don't know what you're doing?
of course not, i...
nora, i actually believed in you.
and the emcee is supposed to be from the streets.
i think they're both really talented.
you think you know better than i do, cabbie?
i will be and do whatever it takes to get this show to the next level.
then let me explain.
take five!
thank you.
i don't think rafe ever forgave him for that.
you saying that's motive for murder?
the thing is,
rafe came asking me about guns a few weeks before dennis was killed.
what?
for talking to him about guns?
he wanted me to get him one.
you know, since i knew my way around the streets.
so i did a .38.
rafe webb?
that's right.
detectives rush, miller.
lady cops, terrific.
here to ask you about dennis hofferman.
what a tragedy that was.
two years ago, i did ibsen.
rafe, we hear you got yourself a gun a few weeks before dennis died.
dennis was shot in a stick-up.
new information says otherwise.
"i heard the cop movie ""blue blood"" was shooting in philly."
i was going to audition.
i'm method.
i needed to tap into the emotions of holding a gun if i was going to play a cop.
so you bought a real one?
where's the gun now, rafe?
it was stolen out of my office just a little time before the show.
especially since people saw you and dennis fighting.
said you weren't too happy with him.
i don't shoot them.
we could bring him in right now for buying the gun.
might help him tap into the emotions of jail time.
but there was a little situation that dennis had gotten himself into.
¢ü i met this truly remarkable girl ¢ü
¢ü in this really incredible town ¢ü
¢ü and she skillfully managed to talk her way into my room ¢ü
very nice, you two.
what are you smiling about?
i don't know.
i've just been kind of flying on air since rehearsals started.
me, too.
all right.
now, do you all remember when i said that trust is the key to performance?
well, i want to try something.
put down your scripts, come up here and form a circle.
here's what i want.
i want you to fall back into the arms of the person behind you.
before you fall,
it's all about creating a safe environment, people.
start with you, robin.
i felt relief when my father died.
clinton, to me.
i don't trust any of you.
i respect that.
dennis?
nora, to dennis.
i think i'm falling in love with my leading man.
me?
plenty of blowups at this place, huh?
welcome to the theater.
he had a thing for nora, i'm afraid.
how did dennis take nora's confession?
nora and lyle are on their way in now.
so we're looking at the love triangle?
yep.
we believe this director?
plenty of big dramas with these people.
hard to sort through what's real and what's made up.
that clinton kid seemed on the level.
you kidding?
you actually bought his act?
i'll put money down on clinton being clean.
a street kid who couldn't break his bad habits.
¢ü life is a cabaret, my friends ¢ü
hey, here's my gal now.
hi.
is one of you detective valens?
i perform on cruise ships these days.
you'd be surprised how high-end the productions are.
nora, how did you feel about dennis?
must have been hard, falling for a guy who was engaged to someone else.
and humiliating.
once everyone else knew about your feelings.
is that why you shot him?
i would never hurt dennis.
he was this beautiful, open person who saw the best in everyone.
after two months, it was like we'd always known each other.
but there was that little problem of his fiancee.
dennis didn't want to hurt her.
but, after the show's run, he was going to leave her.
for me.
really?
'cause that's the first we've heard about it.
we found ourselves during cabaret.
and we found each other.
we hear you got pretty upset when nora announced her feelings for dennis.
me and every other straight guy there.
but you were the only one who stormed out of the theater.
why, then?
these little dramas within the drama always end up hurting the show.
but sounds like you were suffering some fleeting emotions yourself.
nothing i'd let interfere with the performance.
so you're pretty dedicated.
but i know exactly what can happen when emotions start to boil over.
¢ü lady peaceful ¢ü
¢ü lady happy ¢ü
¢ü that's what i long to be... ¢ü
¢ü all the odds are ¢ü
¢ü they're in my favor ¢ü
¢ü something's bound to begin ¢ü
¢ü it's gotta happen ¢ü
¢ü happen sometime ¢ü
¢ü maybe this time ¢ü
¢ü i'll win ¢ü
good.
all right!
great sound check.
now, before we take our break, i have an important announcement.
and, drumroll, please.
he's going to come and see the show next week on opening night!
and he's told me that if he sees good talent, he might sign someone up.
it'll be you the agent signs, nora.
you've got that star quality.
no, it'll be you.
maybe it'll be both of us.
i should've turned off the speakers as soon as she walked into that booth.
but part of me hoped it would explode.
and i'd be the one end up with nora.
gloria made it sound like everything with dennis was solid.
no way.
that woman was furious.
i thought she'd kill him then and there.
she was upset and looking for dennis.
when was your wedding going to be, gloria?
we hadn't decided.
most of my girlfriends pick a place soon as they know they're getting hitched.
gloria, we know you were upset and that you went backstage before the show.
i never even found him.
saw that nora first and left.
we can't help if you don't tell us the truth about your relationship.
i loved dennis.
well, why didn't you tell us, gloria?
i didn't tell anybody.
how could i admit to anyone that it never would have happened?
all i could think about the whole shift was the opening tonight.
almost ran a couple of curbs.
is your girlfriend gonna be there?
what?
i heard you the other night with that actress.
i know something's going on.
but you want it to, don't you?
but i'm just a little confused right now.
obviously.
remember when i first got this job?
of course i remember.
but i never did.
i never did anything except drive a cab.
no, i'm just saying...
brighter.
were things really so dark before?
i just...
i know i've been a disappointment.
i just don't want to be that anymore.
you were never a disappointment to me.
i guess you never really know anyone all the way.
what was the secret meeting with the director, day of the show?
all dennis said was that it was with rafe's bigwig agent and nora.
so i got angry again.
that was the last time we spoke.
so what was this meeting with dennis before the show?
since you left that out before, maybe you can fill us in now.
i didn't think it was important.
our problem is, we called barry turk.
got his client list.
you're not on it.
i was once.
but barry hadn't returned my phone call in six years.
so you lied to dennis and nora.
not exactly.
i mean, i'd left another damn message for his assistant.
"i couldn't tell my actors that i'd slipped to the ""b"" list."
i needed to build myself up in their eyes.
for your own ego?
absolutely not!
maybe you're right.
maybe it was for my own ego.
whatever it was, i'm afraid it may have cost dennis dearly.
barry turk got stuck in new york.
so he'll make the show tonight, be able to see me and dennis perform.
of course.
are you sure?
the truth is, i have a lot of say over who barry chooses to represent.
he must really respect your opinion.
he does.
and he likes to keep a short client list.
only one new client a year.
well, it should definitely be you, nora.
you're truly gifted.
you're right, dennis.
rafe, dennis is 35.
i'm just 25.
i'm the one with a real chance to make it in the business.
i'm the real talent here.
you know i would work the hardest for it.
what was i thinking?
i almost ruined my life because of you!
i thought a little healthy competition would be good for them.
i didn't think nora would be so consumed by it all.
consumed enough you think she'd kill him?
make sure she got the agent?
she made it quite clear she was going to be a star.
no matter what it took.
so nora wanted the spotlight.
we've been going through the play mementos rafe gave us.
he told us dennis rushed to a copy place before the show,
and we found out why.
cabaret program.
each actor has a place where they can write personal stuff to their family and friends.
"""you are the only star that can make my future brighter."""
"""let's set a date."""
since the show never went on,
gloria never saw the program
or knew dennis had come around.
go ahead.
but now i got proof.
clint, this is nora.
always bet on the dame.
your friend clinton's in the next room.
yeah.
you need to tell me what happened, nora.
i'm such an idiot.
why am i such an idiot?
don't know.
but you better start explaining.
and getting convicted of murder might get in the way?
i did not kill dennis.
hey, this ain't a performance, nora.
this is real life, and you're in real trouble.
okay.
okay.
i'm just committed, totally.
that's why i'll bet you'll be a star.
i'll be driving my cab.
this was fun.
you forget too much.
hey, they're looking for you guys in costumes.
i'm gonna get ready.
man, i'm kind of nervous.
i don't blame you.
but i'm afraid dennis has a better shot.
he's just... more commercial, you know?
well, we'll see, i guess.
but why take that chance?
if we mess dennis up, the agent can focus on you and me instead.
what do you mean, mess him up?
look, i know about your background, okay?
just listen, okay?
you could use the director's gun!
i saw that he keeps it in his office drawer.
you want me to shoot dennis?
of course not.
i just want you to rattle him up so he's a wreck onstage.
you are out of your mind.
nobody gets hurt, and we'll go to the next level.
what's crazy about that?
because i would have believed that that was all i was good for.
but not anymore.
and if i ever get an agent, it's gonna be because i put on one hell of show.
after what clinton said, i realized i was acting like a lunatic.
your plan is exactly how it went down.
why do you think i didn't want clinton to talk?
i knew how guilty it made me look.
but i swear on my life,
i did not hurt dennis.
one of them must have done it.
unless someone overheard it.
i'm glad to help, but i'm pretty sure i told you guys everything i know already.
i don't think so, lyle.
no?
no.
we know you were in that booth for sound check, that you could hear everything onstage.
you heard nora's plan the night of the show, and you went through with it, didn't you?
i have no idea what you're talking about.
"the actors are given a chance to ""get onstage, realize a dream."""
come on.
i love playing music.
but the music isn't what people clap for at the end of the show, is it?
that's because they're morons.
but dennis was brave.
he got up his nerve, went out there and auditioned.
you were too scared.
that why you killed him?
or did you kill him just because you knew he was better than you?
better than me?
oh, pretty easy to sit on the sidelines, judging.
i don't think you could've hacked it under those bright lights.
you're wrong!
if i'd gotten onstage that night with barry turk in the front row, everyone would've been blown away!
but you were never gonna get onstage.
with dennis gone, i was the only one who could go on in his place.
i knew every word of that show!
you killed him and thought the curtain would still go up?
i was just gonna hit him in the leg, send him to the hospital.
it isn't fair they canceled the show!
"whatever happened to ""the show must go on""?"
i knew every word.
every word.
you don't believe me?
give me all your money.
lyle, that's the worst fake voice i ever heard.
what are you up to?
you think i'm a joke, huh?
you think you're better than me, huh?
you've had enough.
look, all i want to do is put on a good show and go home to my fiancee.
this is my home!
it's all i have!
for once, i'm gonna be the one that gets to shine!
lyle!
sevde, please.
i don't want to be the object of those bigots!
besides, i banned my mother to give our money to those jackals.
maybe i'm not a high-school graduate as you are... but i know that one does not become a good person by praying five times a day!
interest is, dear brothers, a sin!
it is written on the kuran, the book of allah, too.
so, we will build the biggest islamic industrial installation of europe together.
you will gain up to 30 percent.
because we are honest, because we are incorrupt, ...because we take quran as our guide in the way to god!
god willing, we shall walk together, my brothers!
karl, we have a saying.
if it continues like this, he will be hoist with his own petard.
daddy, i don't want to be unrespectful, but you don't understand.
muslim industrialists have enterprises everywhere in the world.
nothing is what it seems, my son.
look at this there are islamic investment models even in the german banks.
thank god for bread and health he gives us.
i can delay paying the rent of the shop this month.
as i always did your father.
here is the money... 25.000 euro, the money that passed down from your dad.
i will gather the general board after the feast and nominate you for the administrative board.
if things go like this, they will need a container for money.
metin, my son, god sees and protects those who fights for his way.
metin, i drew up a sale contract this morning.
when i get my money back from jimpa, the building will belong to me.
if things go like this, he'll buy the whole street.
of course, it's you, bro, everything is possible.
more than 30 offices that are affiliated to jimpa-group are shut down overnight.
yes...
where did you hear from...
did i miss something?
i wanted him to have everything i didn't.
these bastards are very dangerous, metin!
my honour is insulted.
i can't say it now.
in addition, bilal doesn't have to study abroad to become a good guy.
nobody can't kick me out!
you will pack all of you stuff until next week, got it?
karl, i cannot collaborate any more.
i'm sure that our guys know everything.
and also, how can i protect you in that case?
actually i don't feel like i am being protected, anyway...
look, i'm doing all of these for my religion's benefit.
i know that you don't care it.
you didn't even notice that they pinched more than 200 milliard.
they are really cunning, karl.
you don't get into all these events, do you?
please don't be foolish!
we need to stay by you for few days.
no, this is not a good idea, my daughter.
metin, these men from jimpa are fearless.
not only conscienceless.
dad, you push it too much...
may i drink something?
i'm thirsty.
this explosive is very destructive.
only a small amount of it has been used in hodja's house.
half of the house is blowed up!
a little more amount of it would be enough to blow the whole street up.
they've managed to stabilize his blood circulation.
please call me.
i'll give you important informations.
i will catch those jerks!
i swear you, i'm gonna capture them!
don't get into it!
forgive me that i am so late.
huseyin, what's going on?
you've said, jimpa guys are our friends...
again you?
may i talk to you for a second?
what do you think?
i don't care what the press is writing about this event.
i can support you with the informations i have.
a copy of the police file.
you have some information and i have the opportunity to broadcast them.
i want to see an authoritized person now.
sir, if you call this number, they will certainly help you.
sir, please!
we can get any information we need!
obviously, your friend has a lot of money!
didn't you notice room prices?
take this.
quran is too rigorous...
have you read the bible, too?
of course, it is much more peace-loving!
it depends on the explication...
look at here, please:
"""the islamic people's unity transfers millions of euro to turkey... and other muslim countries first of all for financing the party."
yes, it's metin.
do you see the ring?
listen to me carefully.
if you keep poking your nose in everything you can bring trouble on yourself.
who's he?
button your shirt, otherwise you'll get cold.
metin, can you come here, please?
what's up!
they're specialized in trading with iran and afghanistan.
yeþil electronics, helal foods, cimentopro...
all of them are jimpa's suppliers.
they are shell companies.
these are jimpa's administrators.
i guess he is a deputy in turkey.
let's go, please!
i'll tell you later.
as you see, the computers are produced here.
these things belong to them!
you're looking for wrong people and companies.
who are the people behind it?
it is all about the shell companies.
the names or people are not important.
why the suppliers?
jimpa is a big bowl into which 30 billion euros flows every year.
they need to build partnership with the shell companies in order to get their profit back.
we don't know the other part.
when these companies' dirty laundries are aired in public they go bankrupt and are thrown away.
just like jimpa in germany.
i want to talk to bilal.
how are you?
why are you doing this to me?
why are you doing this?
by the way, germany has become the administrative center of terrorist actions.
it is not iran or afghanistan anymore.
i think, it's our right to know what is going on and whether you were aware of the transfer of such a great amount of money.
is it possible that you don't know what's going on in your country?
we've demanded support from the turkish secret service for many times.
we need more time.
this man is our main clue until now.
a week ago, two men from cologne were catched at the istanbul airport with 20 kg golden.
i want to take their testimony unofficially.
besides, what are your agents doing in istanbul?
hüseyin, i'm just back from istanbul.
dad!
numan...
a little.
a little...
the jimpa-center in istanbul seems legally regular.
because jimpa doesn't work under its own title none of the impeachments can be testified.
jimpa collected the money and transferred it to switzerland and australia through its 30 shell companies in europe.
and it transfers money from there to iran, chechenia, turkey pakistan and afghanistan.
what for do they use that much money?
i'm a businessman.
and naturally, i have aggrements with jimpa and other companies.
"what about the ""trans-orient"" company?"
then don't behave like a little kid!
and stop running after the jimpa guys.
that's all from me.
what would our life mean then, if he gets in trouble?
i was about not to recognize you without your uniform.
"but he works as ""organizer"" and hitman within the islamist groups for long."
we hold that the police intelligence acts impartially on this issue.
we know that a great amount of money is tranferred from germany to mit senior officers and government representatives.
there are forces who try to keep everything the same.
there are of course other forces who fight against as well.
you said that you got information about a camp.
soon a traumatic terrorist action will occur in germany.
the initiators are your citizens.
he should come to turkey to stand trial.
and pay the penalty, of course!
what is our benefit?
we'll give you the names of the terrorists.
cheers!
cheers!
you put your life in danger.
they took sevde from me.
this doesn't relieve your suffering.
but it will become more tolerable.
no, it won't.
this will be a new nightmare and you'll be the same as them.
do you want me to stand still and just watch what's going on?
you have to find a new way.
not by hatred.
otherwise, you can't find the peace you're looking for.
think of bilal.
i do this for him.
metin is becoming a trouble.
everything has a timing.
did you bring my money?
you'll get your money when our holy duty is accomplished.
"""god does not like the betrayers."
keep this bullshit to your preppies!
i don't care about the show you'll do to regain your seized millions.
or maybe to secure jimpa's billions which are not discovered yet.
i don't care as long as you don't make fool of me.
i do my job and go away!
take care of metin!
where did you get this from?
nevermind, just pay the rent.
we'll soon eat a meal!
i have to go to the shop.
where does he have to go?
to the shop.
what are you doing, dear?
i have a strange feeling.
let me look at your brother.
what're you talking about?
i know that huseyin is the backroom man.
you can do everything to your life, it's not my business.
but i won't let you to make bilal's life miserable.
but he didn't bring me anything.
here it is!
metin!
can you wait a second?
it's him?
who's him?
the guy who blow your family up.
where did you find him?
i work at the office for protection of constitution.
i tried to protect you.
what do you want from me?
metin!
since when was my father-in-law working for you?
for many years.
but how many?
we were already in contact when he was living in istanbul.
he was informing us about the suspicious actions of the islamic people's unity.
but we didn't have any proof.
we've found them thanks to you.
try to sleep!
take care of you.
i'll open.
don't take another step!
mom!
it's not me, it's metin!
i can't waste my time with this bullshit.
i didn't do anything.
i just obeyed the rules of our religion.
what kind of a rule is that?
you took my family from me!
now watch your wife's becoming a martyr!
i didn't know that your wife and son were there, too.
i did everything for god's sake.
what are you doing here?
you shout up!
he'll pay the penalty!
do you want bilal to grow up without his dad?
don't interfere!
do you remember, when we learned that our dad died...
he already lost his mom.
dear sirs recent events in our country requires us to be more careful and decisive.
the domestic and foreign threats against our country.
did you like the colour you chosed?
mmh.
why am i trying so hard?
i've kept them for you.
do you think that we still need it?
then go on!
what about me?
uncle numan, my dad and my grandmom are not at home right now!
what about bilal!
bilal, dad and uncle numan are not at home right now!
what about grandmom?
uncle numan dad and grandmom are not at home right now!
what about you?
god is greater than the cruels!
our insurgence will continue until we overcome.
no, i'm not a doctor, but you have a high-stress job, you live alone, you have no family that you see regularly, no pets, no sports, no hobbies.
well, despite what the sign says out front, if you came here 'cause of an emergency, you're in the wrong place.
curatola, jacqueline.
he said something about having a fight, but he was fine.
o.c.c.b. is picking up chatter that philip sanfino's crew has orders to put a hit on you.
me or jimmy riordan?
apparently, after we staged your arrest, they sent a lawyer down.

he died from unrelieved swelling of the brain caused by a severe concussion and the resulting frontal lobe hematoma.
right, when i spoke to him right before he died, he gave me the impression he was in some kind of fight.
well, my dining room chair's a little wobbly.
he's got such a deep sense of responsibility that when something goes wrong, he takes it personally.
but the way to get through this is to honor phil in all we do, in all we achieve.
no, i wouldn't want you to spoil the element of surprise.
yeah, well, you know, even friends have stuff to hide sometimes.
um, did any of these guys not show up for work today?
but he was scheduled to fly for a meeting in boston on the first shuttle.

you know, heller worked, uh, narcotics in the 2-1 for years.
yeah, not if i see you first.
he flipped on some jamaicans in exchange for immunity.

mr. hilbert?
that's my father's name.
sit down and don't move.
then get at the back of the line.
you really want to waste my time making me go round up witnesses, huh?
yeah, and you hit mr. gibson, who later died.
as i told you, we're trying to get to the bottom of this ourselves.
no, as i can see, rand here is a train wreck, and you guys are all up here trying to get your stories straight.
counselor, i need to interview him as soon as possible, so why don't you get him straightened out, all right?
and mr. quayle doesn't make me shrink, either.
sir, yes, sir.
that would scratch a pending bust that's taken up thousands of man hours and should and must go down.
not a lot of room there.
a smart cop can find room between a rock and a hard place.
you know what to do.
neither.
you know, i could screw your weekend up pretty easy if i wanted to, sara.
i can't say for sure, but longacre and thorp will literally bet six figures on which bird flies off the wire next.
work with me here, sara.
i do hear you, detective, but right now all i'm hearing is that mr. hilbert and mr. gibson stepped into that ring voluntarily to more or less audition for the next jackass movie.
it was stupid and tragic, but there is no evidence that mr. hilbert committed a crime.
my office is not charging you with anything at this moment.
no need for gratitude, mr. quayle, but i would appreciate it if your client was available to the detectives should they need any further assistance with the investigation.
they're in my gym bag in the closet by the door.
so you're giving me permission to send my partner to retrieve it?
no, no, no, no, no, no.
it saves taxpayer dollars.
jamie, danny's not saying that gangster justice is right.
if one person's a write-off, then everybody is.

the day we sit at this table and make a pecking order over who's expendable and who's not is the day we lost our way.
jamie, it's not as if sanfino was an honor student that got hit by a stray bullet.
danny has his own personal scale of justice.
he has every right to choose who or what he's gonna lose sleep over at night.
i'll talk to you later.
it's not possible under the circumstances.
i started to think... it seemed like every punch i landed had more on it than it felt like.
well, what does that mean?
"mine, i-i i lifted from my school's athletic department, and they had a little ""property of"" tag on the inside if the cuff."
"the whole ""b"" line, from floors eight to 12, they own."
they put the new hires there, six months free rent.
i'm a police officer with the nypd.
your uncle, philip sanfino, was also placed under arrest, along with escalade bobby and six other of his associates.
among the charges against him is conspiracy to commit murder-- of you.
funny guy.
if you agree to testify and cooperate, you'll be put back in contact with your sister, who's already agreed and been relocated with a new identity.
13 hours.
looks like he's looking right at you.
i wish it were anyone but you, reagan.
yeah, well...
my office, two blocks away.
you check them out?
and what did yourself think?
because i'm a private eye now.
my loyalties are to my clients, not the nypd.
oh, right.
you know, there's... there's one thing that i don't get.
oh, okay, so this conscience of yours, it-it lets you... gain people's trust-- perfect strangers-- and then you screw them over?
okay, let's go.
now, sanfino.
i mean, what's he going to win in the bet that he can't already afford to buy?
i don't know.
the whole thing makes me sick, seriously.
hey, gentlemen.
oh, and then he sent a private investigator over to hilbert's apartment to switch out the gloves the day after gibson died.
what?
yeah, and now gibson's dead just so thorp could win a bet with you.
josh?
you have the right to remain silent, although it seems like you got that memo.
you know, for two smart guys, you really are stupid.
i mean, you know the price of everything, but you know the value of nothing.
i don't have anything on you yet, but you are my new favorite hobby.
dad.
good night, dad.
night.
you see, the law business is a little slow... and since most of my clients wind up losing their houses... this was a natural move for me.
well, this neighborhood is zoned r-3... which allows dogs, cats, phone-answering monkeys... and, oh- [groans]
and now, marge, i'd like to welcome you to the family... with your very own red blazer.
i'm going to do my darnedest to uphold the principles... and ideals this jacket represents.
"""with gas range, central can opener... and foam under flooring for enanced standability."""
oh, well, then you have to ask yourself, is this the right house for you?
i guess we were just captivated by this delightful plaque.
premium, dude!
"well, like we say, ""the right house for the right person."""
as a spineless, potato-cooking housewife who can't compete in the real world?
the first house i have to show you is, um... a handymars dream.
i sure hate to make you come out here and not buy a house.
the home buyer's course... said always look inside the house before buying.
[gasps] and the price has been slashed repeatedly.
if you don't sell a house, you're fired, fired, fired.
there is absolutely nothing else to tell you about this house.
just because everyone who lived in that house was hacked to bits... doesn't mean the flanders will be.
and you get a third wall for your cubicle.
baldy boy hits wire, head comes off...
l'il bandit rolls to a gentle stop.
everybody wins.
man, the air feels good on my neck.
oh, why do i even bother?
well, neighboreenos, i guess this is good-bye.
oh, i better make this quick, or i'm gonna start blubbering like a baby.
now that you mention it, we could use-
[groans] good-bye, ned.
if the slightest thing goes wrong with that house, call me right away.
so long, simpsons.
you've got to tell them the truth, marge.
the truth!
i guess we gave you quite a start.
we were painting todd's room red- pretty messy work- and then we came out here to take a break.
red room.
over there.
well, i'm just glad you're okay.
whoa, this is so dangerous.
why, you-
wha-what the-
[gasps] this is the murder house?
you mean the infamous jealous jockey murders?
this must be where he dropped the dagger.
and this is the butler's pantry, where mrs. astor concealed herself.
and right here's where they found the torso heap- in front of our very own fireplace!
but i lied to you... and i won't feel right until i return your deposit.
we appreciate the offer, marge, but i think we're gonna be very happy here.
uh, marge- [chuckles] you still got that deposit check?
hey, quit hoggir.
oh, i'm badly hurt.
a smashed hotrod, a wrecked police cruiser, a destroyed house!
i've had it with your renegade ways, simpson.
and what really fries me is you returned his check!
i'm sorry, mr. hutz, but i just can't lie to people.
you're one of a kind, marge... and nobody deserves this more than you.
you did the right thing, eventually.
still, it would've been nice to bring home at least one paycheck.
oh, you will, honey.
you will.
$300 for doing nothing?
i feel like such a crook.
i had my birthday at the aquarium.
oh, i'm still getting your business mail at my parents' house.
your contract's almost up, and mr. donaghy's office sent over that new one for you to sign.
did you miss me yesterday, ms. lemon?
mr. donaghy fired all the pages for a day.
didn't you notice your food wasn't pre-chewed?
j-mo, marty goldstein is your accountant too, right?
"planning, oversight, morale-boosting t-shirts indicating everyone ""survived"" a certain barbecue."
there's nothing to challenge me here at kabletown.
so it's agreed.
you know what, i'm insulted that you think it's beneath you to negotiate with me.
right over...
after all, when a dog goes missing, everyone's upset 'cause there's no dog milk for the babies.
if my boy wants transformers, you're gonna be transformers.
let me guess who's who.
so i made a change.
i'm hazel wassername, and yes, you may recognize me from one of my two background acting gigs.
dr. lingard, yesterday, we heard your daughter take full responsibility for her roles in these crimes.
i've learned from having children that when your kid throws a tantrum and holds his breath, you hold your breath too.
when you regain consciousness, believe me, he's ready to leave the toy store.
this is the part of the movie where i fell asleep.
jazz is gonna get you out of this.
you suck.
oh, i'm sorry, ms. orman.
hazel and i switched places.
i just want all the actors and writers there to realize how much they miss me.
do you exchange gifts?
no, i can't quit the page program.
90% of negotiations are lost by the person who speaks first.
going mano a mano against a real adversary, me...
adam locked himself in the bathroom.
that's the phrase i couldn't remember.
if we don't make adam happy, his dad is going to tell the irs my house isn't a church, although i do let children drink wine there.
i mean, when we're acting out, what makes us happy?
so you've lost the initiative, perhaps by being a woman or a shorter man, but you can regain it by fighting on your home turf.
no one has ever won a land war in russia.
not napoleon, not hitler, not even balki in the unaired ninth season of perfect strangers.
elegante, elegante primo, carry the one...
fourth base!
fourth base!
alice!
alice where the hell are you?
i'm coming!
oh, dear god.
alice!
where the hell are you, alice?
why don't you make yourself useful and clean me up?
what are you doing?
i said what are you doing?
alice?
alice?
alice please...
mama!
mom!
honey, honey, honey?
mommy, why did the boy come?
hey guys.
hey.
hi.
thank you.
god, is this old or something?
it tastes like shit.
how do you know what shit tastes like?
morgan...
thank you doll, i appreciate that.
sorry it just tastes like crap to me.
oh well, got to go.
bye hun.
bye sweetie.
bye.
love you, my princess.
i wish she liked us more.
aw baby, she loves you more than anything.
that's so stupid, so typical,
i mean what else are you supposed to say?
i wish we could have one morning in this house, one breakfast without you guys bickering, bickering, bickering, always got to complain about something.
mama's not perfect, mama's not perfect.
guess what?
you're not perfect either.
high-class chef cuisine people on a budget.
want to go through some of the selections?
we have raisin remoulade, spicy sushi.
parisian pate, and truffle tacos.
voila!
we're going to pass it around, everyone will get a chance to try it.
mom!
mommy!
hey, what's up, baby?
oh, i don't feel so good.
oh boy.
hey baby give me your forehead.
you're warm!
here, lie down for me.
hey, you sexy thing.
it's wednesday.
i'm so tired though.
okie dokie.
i'm sorry, i know it matters.
it's ok baby, i don't care.
mama, mommy!
what's wrong?
i had a bad dream.
aw, honey, about what?
a bad boy.
i'll sleep with you, ok?
all right?
come on.
oh, my sweetheart, it's going to be ok.
and i'll see you next tuesday at four.
it's going to be fine bud, you'll get through.
thanks for stopping in.
that was my last client of the day, i am free!
you got some time, right?
sure, i'm done today.
i have a secret.
ok, tell me!
i'm having a baby.
no, really.
oh my god...
let's go tell the kids.
give me a kiss.
let me grab my coat.
why are you wearing those for?
we gave her night vision goggles so now she can see and i can get some sleep.
that's a great idea!
good plan, morgan!
come here, baby.
i love you.
goodnight.
you smart little man.
hey, kisses girly!
i love you babe.
i love you.
oh, have sweet dreams, buddy boy.
ok goodnight.
see you in the morning.
wait, you're going to work?
silly, the baby's the size of a peanut.
yeah, i go to work.
what are we going to name the baby?
see, i told you, i'm getting a baby brother!
i have no idea if it's a boy or a girl or anything like that, but i do know that we should name it wednesday.
but you'll stop work when the baby comes, right?
how long until the baby comes?
only 6 months!
and yeah, i'm probably going to stop for a little bit, just like i did with you and ariel.
why don't you just keep having babies?
then you don't have to work!
it kind of doesn't work that way.
that's a plan.
we'd end up homeless or something.
this lady on tv, she has like 20 kids, and she gets paid to have a tv show with her husband, her and all of her 20 kids.
i've seen that show.
you don't have to have a lot of kids, to live a different kind of a life, you know?
well, right now, i've got to go to work.
and i will see you as soon as i can.
you have a good day.
you too, hun.
bye guys!
well i'm sorry, but there's nothing obviously wrong with sophia.
there's isn't any evidence of a stroke or anything.
i think we ought to take her into the city to the hospital to have some tests done.
what happened just before she started screaming?
nothing.
nothing really happened.
well your mother's getting on in age, it could be many things.
she should be properly checked out.
i'll show myself out.
i'll let you out, doctor.
i think we'll finally try it my way now, mother.
everything alright, alice?
yeah, yeah, everything's fine.
thank you for coming.
oh no, no, no, no, no...
maybe it wasn't meant to be.
we have two healthy, amazing kids, we're already so lucky, baby.
i just feel like it's my fault.
hey, can't say that.
maybe if i did something differently or...
i don't know, something.
i feel like a horrible person,
i'm supposed to be a writer, remember?
we have a family, we live in an expensive city, it's logical.
hello, alice.
listen, i heard about your mother.
she doesn't need last rites, so you can go.
i'd really like to see her.
why do you want to see her?
well, because i worry about her.
you know you're too funny.
you're worried about her now.
i guess it helps that she can't talk, huh?
alice, may i please?
no, you may not.
goodbye.
you cannot blame me.
i can blame whoever i want to.
now, goodbye.
alice.
hey, lunch break?
maybe on that.
you look upset, what's up, baby?
i quit.
what?
you know the last six weeks i've been trying to deal with it, and it's just not getting any better.
the effect that little baby had on me, it's just huge.
i can't go back to my normal life.
i can't.
do you remember dr. wiley?
so what do you say we take a drive out there, and we decide if we want to stay, huh?
i'm trying to concentrate.
what?
morgan, don't you ever talk to her that way!
never talk to your sister that way.
do you hear me, young man?
what?
ariel, hey!
did you say something, mom?
yeah, give me the ipod.
give your mother the ipod.
enjoy the scenery, ok?
how can we enjoy the scenery if you're forcing us to?
what's going on?
mommy, can you call someone?
do we have any service?
service...
shit, no.
now we'll have to do it the old fashion way!
what's a land line?
c'mon, let's walk it, guys.
country will be good for us.
come on, baby.
hit that little latch for me,
i know.
don't worry, we'll make it.
this is a great big old house.
they're bound to have at least one phone.
i hope so.
they've got a fireplace in there, look at all the chimneys.
there she is.
here we go.
hi.
hi.
can i help you with something?
yes.
our car broke down, and our cellphones don't work.
may we use your land line?
oh, um, yeah, i suppose.
thank you so much, come on guys!
i'll show you where the phone is.
thank you.
the phone's right here.
see what we got going here.
ok.
oh, it's so dark in here.
old people like the dark.
she's not that old, morgan.
she thinks she is.
what's that?
i don't know.
ah, it's going to be a while.
uh, i'll let you do your work and i'll go keep your family company.
oh, boy.
that's attractive.
so what brings you around here?
we're actually kind of house-hunting.
oh really, what kind of house are you looking for?
a good one, that's clean.
uh, we're not really sure.
i guess, you know, we'll probably figure it out when we see it.
do you have children?
no, no, no.
it's probably just my mother.
so what kind of house would you guys like?
i want a big one, like this.
this house really isn't so big.
it's pretty big compared to anything in new york city.
i was actually, um, thinking of renting it out.
you are?
you know, my mother and i don't need all this space, and this kind of a house would really like a family.
well they said they'll be here in 45 minutes!
well you're more than welcome to relax in here while you wait.
oh, thank you so much!
thanks, actually i think i'd really like to get some fresh air.
me too.
come on, come on sweetheart.
thank you so much, though.
you're very welcome.
you're welcome.
pretty pleasing.
not at all when i was in there.
it is an impressive place though.
i like the idea of renting as opposed to buying, you know?
yeah, unless this country life is completely horrible.
it could happen!
okay, get her number before we go, ok.
yeah.
i'm going to talk to the kids about it, k?
good, good, good.
wanna know something crazy?
we could actually rent this place.
what do you think of that?
ok, deal.
ariel?
ariel.
ariel, sweetie, hey, honey.
what do you think if we maybe rent this place?
would you like to live here?
ok mommy.
honey, honey look if you don't want to live here that's fine.
but tell me.
no, it's fine.
we just need to make it bright inside.
ok honey, we can do that.
what is that?
oh, cool!
you know what, i bet that belonged to alice, honey.
come on, why don't we go and give it to her?
who knows how long it's been since she saw it.
i can't believe you found her!
i thought my mother threw her out!
why would she do that?
i dunno.
i want you to have her.
where you guys been?
the old house down there.
that house there?
people go in there and never come back out.
i'm just kidding, come on.
what's wrong with the car?
we're driving along, and we hear this sound
"""ba da bum bum"" like the transmission dropped out."
alright, do the key.
have a good one.
i knew when i heard...
yeah, a ghost's in your car, right?
scary, woo!
oh god, that was too weird!
so, what brings you guys out this way?
really?
oh, well you know, it's funny,
i was actually thinking of renting out this house.
this house needs a family, you know.
it's just way too big for me and my mom.
this could be fun.
what do you think?
oh, it really could be.
and we could rent out the brownstown, right?
if we could make enough to live off of, and, it's cheap out here.
it would be so fun.
and you could have an office, the house is sure big enough for it!
i could, couldn't i?
ok.
let's just do it.
ok!
i love you too.
sweet dreams.
hello?
oh, yeah.
well that sounds wonderful.
um, i'll probably need a couple of weeks to clean the place out.
and if it's ok with you, i'd like to leave a lot of the big pieces here.
ok!
i think this is going to be great for everyone.
ok.
i guess we'll speak soon!
ok, alright, bye bye now.
i've sold everything that i can.
there's nothing left to sell.
i just can't handle the bills anymore.
so i'm going to rent the house.
if i could leave you in it, i would.
there's a nice family that would like to live here.
so i think we should let them.
they have children.
oh god, you're so messy.
i'm so excited.
hey!
are we going to get to come and visit?
yeah.
we're moving!
you guys are really moving to the country, huh?
yeah.
the country?
thanks guys!
hey, thanks for the help, you two!
i got to tell you baby,
i didn't think we were going to make it.
but we did.
yeah.
i love you.
a creature?
yeah, our little ones.
i have your lease all ready.
um, i think it's ok.
thank you so much.
that's for you guys.
i'll give this to you.
i don't know what to say, if you need anything... call me, and enjoy the house.
oh, and...
you have fun, ok?
take care of baby doll!
thank you so much.
ok, i'll talk with you soon!
alright, bye bye!
that was so sweet, baby.
you're going to have a great life here!
ugh, it's so dirty!
ew, let's get out of here.
ew, yucky.
do you like this house?
sure, i guess, there's a lot of stuff to jump over.
you don't feel funny or anything?
what's that mean?
ariel, you want to play?
no.
what's wrong with you?
nothing.
i wish i had a brother.
oh, jon.
can you look?
i don't wanna.
it's not funny.
smudgey's not there.
what are we going to do?
why am i laughing?
why are you laughing?
you got to be kidding, morgan?
morgan notices everything.
ok...
i'll just have to tell him.
but he was there when we got here!
he's somewhere in this house!
he might be.
but know this, if we can't find him, your mom and i will get you another one.
i don't want another one!
i want my smudgey!
i'll find him!
i hope so!
not likely.
here we go.
i feel so good.
weird.
can you stop?
excuse me?
you are so... hot.
oh, baby!
mom, we picked a room!
really?
don't you guys want your own room?
no, i don't really care.
no?
you?
why don't you show me, guys?
mommy, look, it's really pretty.
i picked the small room.
give me kisses!
alright, goodnight guys!
i love you!
what baby?
you know how i am about closet doors.
i remember specifically closing that.
gotcha!
hit that light and snuggle.
there you go, baby.
honey, baby what's wrong?
mommy!
ariel!
honey, what happened?
what in the hell is going on, baby?
what's wrong?
thanks.
man, what the hell happened last night?
it was crazy, i don't know, i don't know.
moving is stressful for certain, but between ariel's nightmares and your...
you know maybe this like, new lust i have for you is something to do with not grieving the baby, and maybe i'm flipping it, or..
i mean i'm trying to figure it out, but you know what?
i feel like a teenager and i like it.
i'm loving it.
are you still good with this move?
yeah.
and the high-speed internet guy's coming today, and you know, that will get us back in touch with the outside world.
there's a great counselling group at the community that willy used to run, so...
i'll go make an appearance.
oh, full day, hope it's a good one.
yeah, i love you, my hot little teenager.
man, i should have done this a long time ago.
where's my new little toy?
jesus.
hello, alice.
sorry.
why?
i'd like to see sophia.
what do you have, some like weird fascination with her or something?
alice, please.
come on.
hail mary, full of grace, the lord is with you, blessed art thou above women, and blessed is the fruit...
what are you praying for?
her soul.
you actually think praying is going to help?
i have faith that it will.
you don't know shit.
it is for me.
she was always so beautiful.
alice.
don't you dare take this out on her, or me, for you having failed in life.
me having failed?
i gave up my whole life.
now, thanks for checking on us.
you can go now.
go!
wanna go on a smudgey search?
no, i'm good.
you could bring your doll.
i'm good.
we could pretend it's a little girl that you're trying to save.
looks like a girl to me.
he told me it's a boy.
that's creepy.
you don't look too good.
i'm going to go get mama.
mom.
something's wrong with ariel.
she looks sick.
she seems fine to me, babe.
no, i'm not kidding, you have to go out and see.
honey, she ate like a fiend at breakfast, sick kids don't do that.
this one kid had parasites in his stomach, and they were eating all the food in his gut, so he was always hungry.
come on.
ariel.
you don't feel good?
i told morgan i'm fine.
you don't look fine, honey.
come on.
let me look at you, honey.
how do you feel?
are you ok?
i'm sad.
about what, honey?
i don't know.
maybe there's lead in this house.
yeah, some kid on tv, he got retarded because he ate lead paint.
no, not more sleep, please.
why are they asking me so many questions?
what are you doing, honey?
yeah, she was talking to the doll.
it's really creepy, she does it all the time.
thank you so much, it's going to be great to be back online.
no problem.
enjoy.
hey morgan, internet's up!
i'm father thomas, i was friends with the family that lived here.
but you can understand how i might confuse you with an irish catholic with your red hair.
actually, it's funny, i was baptized, but i chose to never get confirmed.
i just wanted to say if there's anything i can ever do, if i could help or if you would like to talk, or, um, doesn't have to be religious, just wanted to let you know that i could be available.
that's very sweet.
well, you never know.
anyway, keep me in mind, and i just wanted to say welcome, and hope to see you around the neighborhood.
nice meeting you too.
are you ok, mom?
yeah, i'm fine.
was that a priest?
yeah, yeah, father thomas.
why don't we go to church?
i don't think a priest is the only one who can talk to god for me, and i just...
i don't think it's good to give your power away like that.
that's what church is about?
yeah, it's about a lot of things, honey.
but you know, if you really want to go sometime, we could check it out.
ariel's still asleep.
yeah maybe she's tired.
mmm, that sounds pretty cool.
you wanna try it?
come on, you want to go get, like, some hot chocolate or something?
mom?
mom, what are you doing?
yeah, um...
do you know where my night vision goggles are?
um, i think they're in that box from brooklyn in your bedroom.
k, thanks.
sure.
hi, welcome.
may i help you?
well, my wife and i just moved here recently, and i saw your shop and thought i'd check it out.
oh, well, double welcome, then.
you have quite an impressive collection here.
thank you.
i pick everything out myself.
i guess i'll pick out some surprises for my family.
old post road, there's a house there...
space is too big for them, so they're leasing out a smaller house.
so much went on there.
well, too much family drama.
alice and sophie just kind of became a couple of old recluses.
well sophie was cheating, well...
he said she was cheating.
she was something, gorgeous.
but after charles left, she just... became celibate.
i'm going to shop, thanks.
smudgey!
no, no, no, no, no!
no, no, no!
honey, what happened?
what's down there, what happened to you?
something horrible is in the basement, dad.
yeah, he went down there looking for smudgey, and something was down there, i don't know what it was, but it scared the crap out of him.
no, it was like a doll, or a person, or something, but it chased me.
yeah, you should, you should probably take him, too.
what's in the bag?
come on baby, let me check your temperature.
hey, how was work today?
so, are we going downstairs, or what?
i'm going to make spaghetti tonight guys, k?
ok, i have to change first.
it was down here, i know it.
ok, let's go look behind the furnace.
but on the way there, let's get all the dark spots, so you make sure it's not here.
alright kid, let's keep looking.
here's the furnace, don't be scared, i'm with you.
i'm with you.
we're ok, little buddy.
i saw something down there, i know it.
i felt like i was actually necessary, i love that.
this is for your brother.
now these are called dream catchers, they will help you stop having bad dreams!
and this is for my girlfriend.
sweetie, you're never going to eat that much.
arial, that's disgusting.
god, you'd think we never fed this child.
she has parasites, dad.
do you think i have parasites?
of course you don't.
no honey, i don't think you have parasites, ok?
i think morgan is just scared for you because you've been acting all weird lately, ok?
will you please stop it, mom, huh?
come on, just stop it.
help me, help me, help me!
help me, help me, help me!
please, stop!
oh my god, it's...
you are scratched.
baby, how did this happen?
so the exterminator is coming this morning.
what do you think it is?
maybe a nutria, i don't know.
oh, one of those giant 40 pound rat things?
actually i think they're a close relation to the guinea pig.
good morning, guys.
she had bad dreams last night, like really bad.
this was happening way before we moved, remember?
things have gotten more intense though, since we got here.
alfred, tell us about it, would you?
and i just can't get rid of his clothes!
i know i have to it, i mean who wants his sneakers and everything, they're brand new.
but i know i have to get past this,
i know i have to accept the fact that he's gone.
but i can't, it's constantly there.
it's like it's.
and now i'm gonna have to live with it, but i just can't let it go.
i understand, alfred.
it's ok, alfred, go ahead.
alice, can we talk?
unexplainable things?
there's a lot of unexplainable things that have a perfect explanation.
i was wondering, you sat through the whole meeting without sharing, is there anything you'd like to talk about?
no, thank you though.
i know you're still upset about your mother,
i'm a great sounding board.
no, thank you.
anything you say would be kept confidential of course.
look, i never studied psychology or anything like that.
but i do know things, and i know that when you hold things in, for a very long time, they become a part of you, and i've been holding in things for a very, very long time, doctor.
dirty, filthy, crumb-infested whore!
don't cry for her!
morgan, can i please use your extra?
look, these ones you can actually see through, but then there's others, look, like this one, we can just put it somewhere.
yeah, i'm like jack of all trades, you know.
part time exterminator, part time mechanic,
i even do massage if you ever need one.
so we got a problem, and i think it's in the basement.
oh, real problem you got here is a hoarder problem.
that was a rent-in.
pretty good shape, considering it's just those two old crusting women been living here all these years.
yeah, i calls 'em as i sees them.
well, would you look at that.
i've been looking for one of these.
woah, ow my head!
this house is fine, just make sure that the windows and the doors are locked at night, and i know that you said you bolt locked it, you know, keep these things...
sure you don't want to look around some more?
no, your house is fine, you know there's nothing going on here, so just have a good day, have a good night, have a...
this is free, don't worry about it.
hi, is everything ok?
she's fine, she's fine.
no, no, yeah i'm actually here for me.
in all these years that have passed, no one person ever asked me that question.
now that my mom is sick, and her health is failing, there's all this concern out of nowhere.
no, no the last 40 years were hard.
in 50 years we'll be dead, but that reflection will always be there.
don't worry, he'll never tell.
i think what you're doing is fine, don't you worry about a thing.
yes i did, it's a pleasure to meet you.
i mean did you happen to speak with her?
i'm a friend of the family for a very long time.
see i wish it were that simple.
but we had a falling out years ago, so...
a priest, having a falling out, that's not very... very godlike of you, huh?
no, but it is human.
um, i'm not sure, i'm just trying to help.
i have a strange sense that something has happened, or is happening.
you see, years ago, when someone was sensitive, it was unacceptable to use one's abilities in any way that was outside of the church, or religion.
and that's... and that would be you?
so what is that you... that you sense.
a great sadness.
oh, i'm so sorry to hear that.
but this is something different, it's something else, something that involves alice, but it also involves your family.
oh honey, oh my god!
please meet us at the hospital!
morgan, when we get downstairs i need you to get the coat.
oh, missy, oh, how did this happen?
let's go inside where it's warm, and we'll figure things out, ok?
morgan, i will take care of you.
i will protect you from anything and everything always.
you know, ever since we got here, it's been getting a lot worse for ariel.
and for me, like, i don't know what's going on with me, but it's getting more intense.
and i don't want this sensation to end, and it makes me feel so guilty.
well doll-face, i love how you feel too.
well i think alice knows something.
i'm sorry babe, i don't hear anything, just... just the gong.
no, please, you got to listen to more, there was a child's voice.
i read once when something really intense happens, it leaves an impression on reality.
i think that's what hauntings are.
something that, you know how when there's an argument in the room, and everybody leaves the room, there's still tension left over.
if there's a big argument, there's going to be lots of residual tension.
help me, help me, help me.
why are you
"""i wish she would just disappear."
well, you know what, this might not be good for the kids.
after everything that's happened here, you need to just go and do something normal, like going to school.
ok you know what, maybe i'll write, that's what i'm supposed to be doing.
come on, let's go, i'm going to get a coffee on the way back from school, and everything's fine.
sophie, i'm in love with you.
what we did was wrong, god is going to punish us.
mom, open your mouth, i know you can hear me.
i'm the one who even decides whether you live or die.
please, i can't take it anymore.
i feel like you hate me so much, and there's no reason.
it's um, just something that's been going on, and it's still very much a part of me.
i've lost my entire life to this and his mess.
it's time to let somebody know what's really going on.
my mother felt very unfulfilled in her marriage to my father.
one day he just stopped wanting her.
one day, i saw them together, and my father found out...
my mother always blamed me, saying i was the one that told.
so he left... and he took my baby brother with him,
soon after, my mother had a baby boy.
she wanted me to kill him.
but i couldn't, i refused to.
i just wanted to run away.
she thought that he was some evil, because of her being unfaithful to my father...
i'll never, ever forgive myself.
you are the only person on the face of this earth that knows that sebastian ever existed.
and that is why i will never forgive her.
my name is sebastian.
cecile, hi baby, look, the school called, yeah something terrible's going down.
i let her take my life, the same way she took sebastian's.
you know how good it is to be able to say his name?
well, uh, i believe that we are being haunted by him.
i mean maybe, we should think about going back to the city.
we'll find the smudgey first, honey, i wouldn't leave him here.
that's enough, if you continue to feed it, it will live.
she was pregnant with my child!
oh, we have to stay here, we have to stay here.
i can love you, i can love you, little guy, i can.
oh god, i love you so much!
then may i talk to you briefly about my own candidacy?
finally, i vow to run a clean campaign with honesty and integrity to restore this vibrant district to its former glory.
citizens of the aventine, my name is of victor of the grachaee and i am a man you can trust.
it's time to stop the rot.
proper acting's been a bit thin on the ground so i'm doing a bit of clapping work to keep my hand in.
except i'm getting death stares off a goblin.
that would also have been forever.
we've got landlord by the goolies.
once victor gets in, our rent might even go down.
should i be compassionate, head tilted to the side, how-are-you-feeling type of nurse?
or more of a strict and no nonsense, shut your mouth and drink your medicine?
what's the point in having this power if you can't spread it around?

i don't understand it at all.
i just don't understand.
what's wrong?
what don't you understand?
i've never heard such a strange story.
why don't you tell me about it?
we happen to have a wise priest in our midst.
no, not even the renowned, wise priest from kiyomizu temple has heard a story as strange as this.
so you know something about this strange story?
this man and i have just seen it and heard it ourselves.
in the courthouse garden.
the courthouse?
a man was murdered.
on top ofthis gate, you'll find at least five or six unclaimed bodies.
you're right.
war, earthquake, winds, fi re, famine, the plague...
year afteryear, it's been nothing but disasters.
and bandits descend upon us every night.
i've seen so many men getting killed like insects, but even i have never heard a story as horrible as this.
this time, i may finally lose my faith in the human soul.
it's worse than bandits, the plague, famine, fire, or war.
look here, priest.
enough with the sermon.
it sounded interesting, at least while i kept out of the rain.
i don't understand any ofthose three.
i'll tell you about them.
calm down and tell me slowly.
the rain's not going to stop any time soon.
rashomon
it was three days ago.
i went into the mountains to get wood.
i ran as fast as i could to tell the police.
i was the one who first found the body.
did i see a sword or something?
no, nothing at all.
just a woman's hat caught on a branch, and the cap of a samurai that had been trampled on.
there was a cut-up piece of rope near the body, and further along in the leaves, a shiny amulet case with red lining.
yes.
that was all i found, yes.
yes.
i met the murdered man before his death.
it was three days ago, in the afternoon.
on the road from sekiyama to yamashina.
the woman had a veil, so i couldn't see her face.
the man was armed with a sword, as well as a bow and arrows.
little did i expect that he would meet such a fate.
a human life is truly as frail and feeting as the morning dew.
what a shame that his should end this way.
i'm sorry.
this man i caught is tajomaru.
yes, the notorious bandit everyone speaks of.
the last time i almost caught him, he looked the same and he carried that same sword.
it was two days ago at dusk, by the banks of the katsura...
what's wrong?
all these belonged to the dead man, yes.
the irony of tajomaru being thrown off his stolen horse, this had to be fateful retribution.
on that day...
i was riding that horse and i was suddenly very thirsty.
so around osaka, i drank from a spring.
there must have been a dead poisonous snake upstream.
after a while, i got an incredible stomachache.
by the time i came to the river, i couldn't hold it any longer.
so i got off the horse and crouched in the field.
i fell off?
obviously, a fool can think only foolish thoughts.
i know sooner or later you'll have my neck, so i'm not going to hide anything.
it was this tajomaru who killed that man.
suddenly a cool breeze rustled the leaves.
ifit hadn't been for that wind, i wouldn't have killed him.
i caught a glimpse and then she was gone.
maybe that's why.
i thought i saw a goddess.
at that moment i decided to capture her, even if i had to kill her man.
but if i could have her without killing, all the better.
my intention then was to take her without killing the man.
but i couldn't do it on that road to yamashina.
what do you want?
what do you want?
what is it?
don't be suspicious.
take a good look at it.
there are some ruins over there.
when i dug up the mound, i found a heap of swords and mirrors.
i buried them in a grove behind the mountain so no one else would find them.
if you're interested, i'll sell them to you cheap.
it's over there.
walk ahead of me.
your husband has taken sick.
when i saw that, i envied the man and i suddenly hated him.
i wanted to show her how pathetic he looked tied to that pine tree.
these thoughts that weren't there before filled my head.
i had never seen such fierceness in a woman.
and so i had succeeded in having her without killing her husband.
i still had no intention of killing him.
but then...
wait!
stop!
either you die or my husband dies.
one of you must die.
to have my shame known to two men is worse than dying.
i will go with the survivor.
so i had to kill him, but i wanted to do it honorably.
he fought very well.
we crossed swords 23 times.
i remember this because i'm still impressed.
no one had ever crossed swords with me more than 20 times.
i don't know.
when the man died, i turned to her.
she was gone.
the fighting must have scared her and she ran away.
i ran out to the mountain road.
all i found was her horse grazing calmly.
i didn't even look for her.
i exchanged it in town for liquor.
it had pearl inlay.
looked very valuable.
i totally forgot about it.
that was foolish.
the biggest mistake i ever made!
even amongst the bandits, tajomaru is famous for being a womanizer.
who knows what really happened to that woman who left her horse?
well, that woman showed up at the courthouse.
she was hiding in the temple when the police found her.
it's a lie.
tajomaru's story and the woman's.
it's human to lie.
most of the time we can't even be honest with ourselves.
that may be.
but it's because men are weak that they lie, even to themselves.
not another sermon.
i don't care if it's a lie, as long as it's entertaining.
what story did the woman come up with?
well, it's completely different from tajomaru's story.
so different that her face didn't even show the fierceness he spoke of.
that man in the blue kimono,
after forcing me to yield to him, proudly announced that he was the infamous tajomaru,
and laughed mockingly at my husband who was tied up.
how horrified my husband must have been.
the more he struggled, the tighter the ropes dug in.
even now, when i think of his eyes, my blood turns cold in my veins.
what i saw in them was neither anger, nor sorrow,
but a cold light, a look of loathing.
don't.
don't look at me like that.
it's too cruel.
now kill me.
kill me at once.
stop.
don't.
please don't.
i must have fainted after that.
when i came to and looked around...
imagine my shock.
i saw my dagger in my dead husband's chest.
i was in shock
and i don't remember how i left the woods.
but when i came to,
i was standing by the pond, at the foot of the hill.
i threw myself into the pond.
i tried many different things.
but i failed to kill myself.
what should a poor, helpless woman like me do?
but women use their tears to fool everyone.
they even fool themselves.
so you have to beware of the woman's story.
when you hear the dead man's story--
he spoke through a medium.
his story was also lies.
but dead men don't lie.
why is that?
i refuse to believe that man would be so sinful.
suit yourself.
but is there anyone who's really good?
maybe goodness is just make-believe.
what a frightening--
man just wants to forget the bad stuff and believe in the made-up good stuff.
nevermind.
let's hear the dead man's story.
i am in darkness now.
i am suffering in the dark.
cursed be those who cast me into this dark hell.
after the bandit attacked my wife, he tried to console her.
she sat on the leaves, staring down at her knees.
the bandit was cunning.
leave the husband and why not marry him instead?
he said he only attacked her out of his love for her.
when she heard that, my wife raised her face as if in a trance.
she had never looked so beautiful.
and what was my beautiful wife's response to the bandit in front of her helpless husband?
wherever.
take me wherever you want.
that's what she said.
but that wasn't her only sin or i wouldn't be suffering in the dark like this.
please kill him.
while he's alive, i cannot go with you.
kill him!
those words were like a wind that threatened to blow me into the depths of darkness.
has such a hateful thing ever been uttered by a human before?
even the bandit turned pale at those words.
please kill him.
what do you want me to do with her?
kill her or save her?
you only have to nod.
for these words alone, i was ready to pardon his crime.
kill her or let her go?
i don't know how many hours passed.
she got away.
now i'll have to worry about my own fate.
everything was silent.
i heard someone crying.
someone is crying.
whois that?
everything was silent.
how quiet it was.
suddenly the sun went away.
i was enveloped in deep silence.
i lay there in the stillness.
then someone quietly approached me.
that someone gently withdrew the dagger from my heart.
it's not true!
now it's getting interesting.
it seems you saw the whole thing.
so why didn't you tell the court?
i didn't want to get involved.
you can talk about it here, right?
tell me, then.
your story seems to be the most interesting.
they are common stories these days.
i even heard that the demon living here in rashomon fed in fear of the ferocity of man.
i found the woman's hat in the mountains.
you already said that.
about 20 yards further, i heard a woman crying.
from behind a bush, i saw a man tied up, a woman crying and tajomaru.
so you lied when you said you found the body.
i didn't want to get involved.
all right, then.
he was down on his knees, begging the woman for forgiveness.
until now, whenever i wanted to do something bad, i did it.
that way i suffered less.
but today, it's different.
i beg you to be my wife.
the notorious bandit tajomaru is begging you on his hands and knees.
if you wish, i'll even stop being a bandit.
i have enough stashed away to give you a lavish life.
and if you don't want my dirty money, i'll even work.
i'll stoop to selling odds and ends on the street to support you.
i'll do anything if you come with me.
marry me, please.
if you say no, i have no choice but to kill you.
please, say yes.
stop crying and answer me.
tell me you'll be my wife!
say it!
it's impossible.
how could i, a woman, say anything?
you mean it's up to us men to decide.
hold it!
i refuse to risk my life for such a woman.
you've been with two men.
why don't you kill yourself?
hopeless.
i don't want this shameless whore.
you can have her.
at this stage, i'd rather lose her instead of the horse.
don't follow me!
stop crying.
it's not going to work anymore.
stop it.
don't bully her.
women are weak by nature.
it's you who are weak.
if you are my husband, why don't you kill this man?
then you can tell me to kill myself.
you're not a real man either.
when i heard you were tajomaru, i stopped crying.
i was sick of this tiresome daily farce.
"i thought, ""tajomaru might get me out of this."""
but you were just as petty as my husband.
a woman loves a man who loves passionately.
a man has to make a woman his by his sword.
i don't want to die!
so that's the real story.
i doubt it.
no one lies after he says he's going to do so.
it's horrifying.
if men don't trust each other, this earth might as well be hell.
no, i believe in men.
i don't want this place to be hell.
shouting doesn't help.
think about it.
out of these three, whose story is believable?
no idea.
in the end, you cannot understand the things men do.
what are you doing?
what's it to you?
that's terrible!
terrible?
what about this kid's parents?
no, you're wrong.
think about what they went through to abandon this baby.
i don't have time to mind everyone's feelings.
you selfish...
what's wrong with that?
dogs are better off in this world.
if you're not selfish, you can't survive.
damn it.
everyone is selfish and dishonest.
making excuses.
the bandit, the woman, the man and you!
so what did you do with the dagger?
the valuable one with the pearl inlay that tajomaru was talking about?
if you didn't, who stole it?
it seems i'm right.
a bandit calling another a bandit.
now that's selfish.
do you have anything else to say?
if not, i'll be going.
i have six kids of my own.
another one wouldn't make a difference.
it's inevitable to be suspicious of others on a day like this.
i'm the one who should be ashamed.
i don't understand my own soul.
no, i'm grateful to you.
thanks to you,
i think i can keep my faith in man.
don't mention it.
the end
weknowit 'smatt.
just do what he says.
it'swhatjackson'sfor .
yourmotherwrotethisnote .
i don't know how i can sit till someone paid for her death.
whatpetermanagedtodo doesn't come without a price.
he's going to come at you, derek.
itwasn'tsupposed to happen like this.
i've done everything that you've asked of me.
helpyourfriends.
leave matt and jackson to me.
youknowwhenyou 're drowning, you don't actually inhale until right before you black out.
it's called voluntary apnea.
it's like no matter how much you're freaking out, the instinct to not let any water in is so strong that you won't open your mouth until you feel like your head's exploding.
but then when you finally do let it in, that's when it stops hurting.
it's not scary anymore.
it's actually kind of peaceful.
areyousayingyou hopematt  felt some peace in his last moments?
idon'tfeelsorryforhim.
canyoufeelsorryforthe nine-year-old matt who drowned?
justbecauseabunchof dumbasses dragged him into a pool when he couldn't swim doesn't really give him the right to go off killing them one by one.
and by the way, my dad told me that they found a bunch of pictures of allison on matt's computer.
and not just of her though.
i mean, he photoshopped himself into these pictures.
stuff like them holding hands and kissing.
you know, like he had built this whole fake relationship.
so yeah, maybe drowning when he was nine years old was what sent him off the rails, but the dude was definitely riding the crazy train.
onepositivething came out of this, though.
right?
yeah.
yeah, but i still feel like there's something wrong between us.
i don't know.
it's just like tension when we talk.
same thing with scott.
haveyoutalkedto him since that night?
no,notreally.
i mean, he's got his own problems to deal with though.
mom.
mom, we're gonna have to talk about this eventually.
okay.
i'm going.
i love you.
idon'tthinkhe's talked to allison either.
but that might be more her choice, you know.
her mom dying hit her pretty hard.
but i guess it brought her and her dad closer.
jackson?
jackson hasn't really been himself lately.
andwhataboutyou ,stiles?
feeling some anxiety about that championship game tomorrow night?
whywouldyouask methat ?
i-i never actually play.
but hey, since one of my teammates is dead and another one's missing, who knows, right?
youmean,isaac.
one of the three runaways.
you haven't heard from any of them, have you?

idomy notes after the session.
yourmemory'sthatgood?
howaboutwe  get back to you?
stiles?
i'mfine.
yeah, aside from the not sleeping, the jumpiness, the constant, overwhelming, crushing fear that something terrible's about to happen.
it'scalledhypervigilance, the persistent feeling of being under threat.
butit'snotjust a feeling, though.
you know, like i can't even breathe.
likeyou'redrowning?
yeah.
soifyou'redrowning,and you're trying to keep your mouth closed until that very last moment, what if you choose to not open your mouth?
to not let the water in?
well,youdo anyway.
it's a reflex.

and did you forget about the part where you feel like your head's exploding?
ifit'saboutsurvival, isn't a little agony worth it?
andwhatif it  just gets worse?
then think about something-
"""if you're going through hell, keep going."""
asyoucansee ,scott, there's been some interesting developments lately.
i think we should catch up.
comeon,scott,let 'sbe realistic about who's got the upper hand here.
lethergo .
can'tdothat.
but let her live?
that's up to you.
whatdoyouwant?
iwantto talk.
you haven't been answering your phone.
lethergo ,andwecan talk about whatever you want.
iwantthesamething that i have always wanted.
i want derek and his pack.
youhavethemall inhiding.
how am i supposed to know where they are?
ithinkwiththe proper motivation, you could draw them out.
and if you hadn't noticed, i now have a fairly impressive means by which i can motivate people.
whydoyouthinki'm able to control him?
oh, you know the myth, scott.
the kanima is a weapon of vengeance.
thisisaboutkate?
ididn'tjustcome here to bury my daughter.
i came to avenge her.
areyouokay?
idon'tknow what's happening.
i don't know what that thing was or even what you are, but whatever he wants, just give it to him.
mom,it'snotthateasy .
dowhathe wants.
just give him what he wants.
idon'tknowifi can.
derektoldus to  be back before sunup.
ithoughtiheardsomething.
no,listen.
coyote?
wolf?
no,itcan'tbe.
there are no wolves in california.
no,butthere are werewolves.
thatdidn't sound like derek.
maybeitwas...
you decided.
when?
tonight.
everyone's gonna be at the game.
and we figured it was the best time.
it's not like we want to.
what do you want?
since i just turned 16 a month ago, i wouldn't mind getting my license.
i can't do that if i'm dead, you know.
well, i told you there was a price.
you didn't say it would be like this.
yeah, but i told you how to survive.
you do it as a pack.
and you're not a pack without an alpha.
we know.
you wanna look for another pack?
how are you even gonna find one?
we think we already did.
would you mind seeing who that is?
it's okay, isaac.
we're open.
like all of a sudden we heard all this howling.
it was unbelievable.
there must have been a dozen of them.
yeah, or maybe only two.
you know what the beau geste effect is?
if they modulate their howls with a rapid shift in tone, 2 wolves can sound like 20.
look that doesn't matter, okay?
there's another pack out there.
there's got to be.
we've made up our minds.
we lost, derek.
and it's over.
we're leaving.
no.
no, you're running.
and once you start, you don't stop.
you'll always be running.
i expected a slightly warmer welcome.
but point taken.
why does it smell like that?
what?
scott said almost the same thing to me a few months ago.
one day he could somehow tell the difference between which animals were getting better and which were not.
he's not getting better, is he?
like cancer.
osteosarcoma.
it has a very distinct scent, doesn't it?
come here.
i know you're well aware of what your new abilities can do for you.
improved strength, speed, and healing.
you ever wonder what it could do for others?
give me your hand.
go on.
what did i do?
you took some of his pain away.
only a little bit.
but sometimes a little can make quite a difference.
it's okay.
first time he showed me, i cried too.
it's quite a situation you've got yourself in here, derek.
i mean, i'm out of commission for a few weeks and suddenly there's lizard people, geriatric psychopaths, and you're cooking up werewolves out of every self-esteem-deprived adolescent in town.
what do you want?
well, i want to help.
you're my nephew.
one relative that i have left.
you know, there's still a lot that i can teach you.
can we just talk?
sure.
they're leaving tonight, during the game.
so, why are you telling me?
i'm asking you.
i'm asking for your advice.
why?
because i trust you.
because you always seem to want to do the right thing.
i usually have no idea what i'm doing.
actually i always have no idea what i'm doing.
i'm not going anywhere if that's what you mean.
i have too many people here who need me.
are you gonna go with them?
yeah.
yeah, i think i will.
can't even think about playing some meaningless game right now.
you weren't at practice last week, were you?
why?
and you didn't hear?
jackson was there.
really?
that means... the game tonight?
yeah.
he's playing.
you okay, dude?
i'm perfect.
well, we all know that, but are you okay?
you didn't answer my texts all week.
i'm getting worried about you.
jackson.
stay in the goal tonight, danny.
do not come out.
and if you see me coming towards you, run the other way as fast as you can.
in less than an hour, aircraft from here will be joining others from around the world.
"and you will be launching the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind."""
what?
what the hell is he talking about?
"""we are fighting for our right to live."""
yeah, it's the speech from independence day.
"""butastheday the world declared in one voice..."""
coach'sfavoritemovie.
"""wewillnotgo quietly into the night!"""
doesheknowany  sport speeches?
"""todaywecelebrate our independence day!"""
wellspoken,coach.
i might have chosen something with a little more historical value, but there's no denying your passion.
and while i haven't been here long, there's no denying my pride in having a winning team for this school.
i know you'll all be brilliant tonight, even with only one co-captain leading you.
now, i'm your principal, but i'm also a fan.
so don't think i'll be content to watch you merely beat this team.
get out there and murder them.
youheardtheman .
asses on the field!
it'snotmy decision.
mccall,you're failing three classes.
coach,youdon'tget it.
you have to let me play.
tonight, you're on the bench.
that wasn't my finest performance, considering it ended in my death.
hit me, hit me.
i can see that it's cathartic for you.
you're letting go of all the anger, self-loathing, and hatred that comes with total and complete failure.
i may be the one taking the beating, derek, but you've already been beaten.
so, go ahead.
hit me if it would make you feel better.
after all, i did say that i wanted to help.
youcan'thelpme.
yeah,he'salreadyhere.
notyet.
it'sgoingto  be bad, isn't it?
lookslikeit .
scott,theothernightseeing my dad get hit over the head by.
i can't...
it's okay.
you suck slightly less.
yes,unlessyou'd rather play with yourself.
ialreadydid that today, twice.
why is my son running out to the field?
becausehe'son theteam?
my son is on the field!
canyouhearme?
then listen closely because the game is about to get interesting.
playitagain.
let's put a real clock on this game, scott.
i'll give you until the last 30 seconds.
when that scoreboard clock begins counting down from 30, if you haven't given me derek, then jackson is gonna kill someone.
should it be your mother, who so bravely came out to support you?
or the sheriff, your best friend's father?
or how about the pretty little redhead who managed to survive the bite of an alpha?
or maybe one of these innocent teenagers with their whole life ahead of them?
or should i do everyone a favor and kill that ridiculous coach?
but you are going to help me take derek down.
because if you don't...
i'll have jackson rip someone's head off right in the middle of the field and drench everyone you love and care about in blood.
prime example right here.
i'm not as strong as i used to be.
an alpha like you.
i need you as much as you need me.
why would i want help from a total psycho?
first of all, i'm not a total psycho.
and by the way, you're the one that slashed my throat wide open.
so, we need each other.
sometimes when you need help, you turn to people you'd never expect.
he's probably just warming up.
plenty of time to turn it around.
you came to help.
i came to win.
come on!
go!
no, right now it's pretty much just keep jackson from killing anyone.
well, that might be easier if you're actually in the game.
we have to make it so coach has no choice but to play you.
he's got a bench full of guys he can use before he ever puts me on the field.
can you do it without putting anyone in the hospital?
i can try.
lahey!
you're in.
seriously, what the hell is your problem?
stop.
i think jackson nicked me 'cause i can feel it spreading.
then you better be willing to sacrifice your own pawns.
either you're in or we forfeit.
you have to.
i will.
please, allison, stop.
don't you know what you're really bargaining for, scott?
haven't you guessed what the real offer on the table is?
it's always been allison.
you give me derek, and i'll let you have allison.
you owe me a new bow.
"""caught"" came very close to kill."
i think my way worked out pretty well.
call us back.
what?
it's just the first time i've heard you call him that.
this would be so much more poetic if it were halftime.
because of it, gerard is winning.
he's going after your wolves, one by one.
and it's gonna prove why you should trust me.
because i'm going to tell you how to stop jackson.
know how to kill him?
shoot it!
well, sometimes myths and legends bear a hint of truth.
that's why it doesn't seek a pack.
and right now, his identity is disappearing beneath the reptilian skin.
you know, in case you hadn't noticed, jackson doesn't really have too much of a heart to begin with.
one young lady with whom jackson shared a real bond.
who could save him.
your best ally has always been anger, derek, but what you lack most is a heart.
that's why you've always known that you need scott more than anyone.
and even somebody as burned and dead on the inside as me knows better than to underestimate the simple yet undeniable power of human love.
nothing.
scott, where are you?
somebody is down on the field.
back off!
move.
we're gonna need a medic!
he did it to himself.
miles here and three of his people came to the island about a week ago.
once they have me, their orders are to kill everyone else on the island.
it's a sanctuary.
what are those?
sayid said the engine was down.
i didn't see him.
calm down, chicken little.
code 1 4-j.
what's code 14-j?
i need you to stay close to me.
we don't know anything about this.
any luck fixing the sat-phone?
if i had some strips of ferrous metal, a nine-volt battery clip and some wiring...
bernard, you got a second?
certainly, mr moriarty.
right now, i need you to tell me what's going on.
you said i need to survive this.
charlie?
careful, careful.
miles?
your friend desmond had a boat.
remember the name charles widmore, don't you?
he tried to convince the world your plane was on the bottom of the ocean?
what does it have to do with me?
he goes by the name of ishmael bakir.
because they have a hostage.
who's charles widmore?
you'll step out the front door, your hands above your head, walk to me.
served with distinction 1996 to 2001, but since then worked with a number of mercenary organisations, specifically in uganda.
get your ass out here right now or i'm gonna kill your daughter.
i'd like to present a counter-proposal.
they killed karl and my mother.
you have ten seconds, ben.
where do you think you're going?
they took it from me.
once you let your grief become anger, it will never go away.
i spent the last eight years of my life searching for the woman i love.
so don't tell me this is not my war.
i have to say goodbye to my daughter, john.
what are you sending?
"""what happened to the... doctor""?"
think your chopper buddies ran that way, if you want to catch up.
yeah, i think i'll stay with you guys for now.
i'm done with all this.
you too.
you harm so much as one hair on his curly head i'll kill you.
don't stand there looking at me with those horrible eyes of yours and lay the blame for the death of that poor girl on me, when we both know very well i didn't murder her at all, benjamin.
you creep into my bedroom in the dead of night, like a rat, and have the audacity to pretend that you're the victim?
what you are.
penelope, is it?
now, you can do better than that.
rest, now, sire.
nonsense!
i'm fighting fit today.
come on, i'll take both of you!
majesty, you've worn me out.
some proper opposition then, d'artagnan!
you know, treville used teach me how to fight when i was a lad.
it seems like i've surpassed him.
he forgot everything i thought him.
but i will say this, he never lacked courage.
your majesty?
guards!
louis.
louis?
find athos.
sire.
forgive me.
it's happened.
god rest his soul.
take the king, hide him somewhere in the city until i tell you it is safe to return.
paris is surrounded by our enemies.
involve only people you trust.
not aramis.
you don't trust aramis?
it's safer if he doesn't know.
you're right.
i'm going to make you an honorary musketeer.
it means you have to be brave and clever and strong.
i hear you're a born horseman.
hold on tight.
you'll like this.
will this work?
civil war is coming to paris and that child is the prize.
bring me my son.
where is he?
i have sent him away from the palace into hiding.
he wasn't safe the moment the king died.
he's protected here!
no one is protected here!
the duke of lorraine's army are preparing to march on paris.
they are coming for him.
you're gambling with my son's life!
i am saving it!
majesty, i have entrusted him to one of my musketeers.
who?
you have no right to do this, treville.
tell me where he is.
majesty, i have done this for france.
you have gone against france.
against me!
you are only a minister, you have no authority.
goodbye, louis.
it's my turn now.
and mine, cousin.
this is our fight.
thanks to my friend grimaud's supplies.
don't forget that.
i do not forget.
but he is not family.
now we must decide the right moment for our attack.
i don't want to hear this!
the time is now.
why?
the queen is alone, surrounded by enemies.
that's not what i meant.
aramis, the queen is alive and the king is dead.
our enemies are taking aim.
we need to deal with that.
and i intend to keep it that way.
when you get to the palace, will you ask the queen if i can visit her?
i don't think we'll be going anywhere near the queen.
constance!
i've been ordered to hide him in paris.
come inside.
quickly.
you look better.
why has the queen given you her son?
not the queen, treville.
gaston's army has reached the outskirts of paris.
well, this is the first place they'll look for him.
no, there's too many people who'd betray him.
there's a better place, but he's going to need different clothes.
that's more like it.
we are here for the formal reading of the king's will.
the king... revoked the choice of your majesty as regent.
it was ratified in secret by the council.
this is an outrage!
i am a senior member of this council and i was not aware of this.
why have you kept this from me?
what?
this cannot be.
majesty, it was the king's final command.
since france is at war with spain, the country of your birth, he believed it would be safer to appoint a soldier.
get out of my way!
for someone of little personal ambition your rise is a miracle, treville.
the king appointed me so he could punish the queen.
he certainly went against the natural order of things, but we found him quite immoveable.
i would have moved him if i'd known about this.
we find no fault with you, treville.
i cannot do this without the council's support.
you have it.
but for the nobility.
nothing's changed.
everything has changed.
i need your help now more than ever.
why isn't athos with us?
don't concern yourself with athos.
you all have a part to play.
i want you to deliver an order to marcheaux.
i'm disbanding the red guard.
is that wise when paris is under attack?
i only want loyal frenchmen defending us.
treville.
regent?
we did hope you'd take it like a man, didn't we?
but then again, we knew you wouldn't.
well, we will drive you and treville out of paris.
guards!
i had that under control.
next time i'll just let you die.
no one will accept treville as regent.
he's nothing!
you will hang, you will hang.
i'll see to it that you do.
something i learned a from a spanish prisoner.
right.
well, i imagine with that, the thing is just knowing when to stop.
very good.
the king.
and the new regent.
where have you been?
enjoy it while it lasts.
there's an army coming.
how could my brother have been so stupid?
he has defiled france.
appointing a commoner as regent.
treville!
your brother was not a fool.
a spanish queen is hard to love, but treville is a hero to the people.
we take paris immediately.
there's nothing to stop us.
will they love you, cousin?
i hope so.
of course they will!
they will cheer me when i enter the city.
i will be protector of the king.
and then in a year or two, the little swine can have a fatal riding accident or die of typhus.
but my army will hold the city until you, gaston, give me back my title and full independence for lorraine.
i will no longer be france's vassal.
in a few years' time, he'll be ordering his council to double the price of wheat and throwing anyone who protests in jail.
do you have a problem with this?
but it's true though.
but you're still young, aren't you?
there's always time for improvement.
there's no sign of life.
careful now.
it's been empty since christophe left.
we can make it more comfortable, can't we?
you no longer have a red guard.
regent treville.
i don't even know who that is.
if the king foresaw these events, this was the wisest thing he ever did.
why have i been summoned again?
your majesty, i never wanted this responsibility.
i assumed i would be serving you.
which i would have done with honour.
athos, do you know where my son is?
majesty, the council is waiting.
i will not sign this.
we have all signed, majesty.
i want gaston to pay his last respects to his brother.
i will not pardon gaston.
he is coming anyway and i would rather have him here in peace than behind lorraine's army.
it must have your signature to make it law.
the world's gone mad.
do you all hate me so much?
are we likely to come out alive?
that's your safe conduct.
a royal pardon.
gaston.
while you're there, you can get an idea of the strength of their army.
d'artagnan, find me a boy.
about six years old.
isn't that a little young for a musketeer?
he's a decoy.
when gaston comes to the palace we want him to think the dauphin is being sent away.
can i see him?
can i visit the queen?
cannon.
heavy cavalry, light cavalry.
well-armed.
i heard lorraine's bankrupt.
who's paying for all this?
grimaud.
my men are going to slit the throats of every musketeer that they come across.
treville has just handed me a trained regiment of soldiers inside the walls of paris.
give them money.
the red guard work for me now.
let them have the palace.
we'll control the city.
do you think i want to go near my brother's stinking corpse?
you dishonour the late king.
he's been generous to you.
that's a pardon.
he dishonoured me by making that dull soldier regent.
the king's will is complex.
treville believes you will want to see it.
is there a legacy?
we've been sent here to escort you back.
leave us.
obviously, i must go.
no.
this means nothing.
whatever louis intended, he's dead.
but this may be good news for all of us.
for you, perhaps.
cousin, there may be no need to spill any french blood.
shall i investigate?
our fortunes are bound together.
surely what benefits me benefits us both.
saddle my horse!
sylvie!
fit for a boy at least, if not a king.
i'll fetch him.
sire?
where are you hiding?
i bet i can find you.
he's gone!
leave him!
leave him!
he's a little thief.
we can pay you.
he was filling his pockets.
look, here, take this...
arrest this lot, will you?
it's okay.
we need to leave.
arrest these lot.
just keep moving.
i'll think of something.
regent treville.
i knew my brother would finally pardon me.
he didn't.
the pardon is mine.
and i suppose the legacy is yours too.
there is no legacy.
this is a trick?
i intend to see the new king through to his maturity and to make france peaceful and prosperous.
i will do my best to ensure the king loves and respects you.
and, of course, there is always the possibility of ascending to the throne if he dies childless.
that would be too long a wait.
what do i get now?
i'm told you admire the luxembourg palace.
moderately.
i can also guarantee a generous stipend from the exchequer in keeping with your high status.
you all hate me.
i want france united, with all of its nobles loyal to the new king and free of conspirators.
it's in my interests to make you happy, gaston.
not now, captain.
i'm sorry.
the queen is distressed.
the king is unwell.
i am family!
this is not the time, gaston.
later, perhaps.
if they took the armouries to the east of paris we'd be hard pushed to stop them.
that's what i feared.
put the garrison on standby.
is the boy d'artagnan found ready?
yes, we've dressed his mother as a lady in waiting.
see she's well paid.
aramis, make sure gaston takes the bait.
porthos, come with me.
i'm going to talk peace with the duke of lorraine.
you couldn't make your mind up about me, could you, louis?
"""oh, gaston, gaston, you let me down again."
"""oh, gaston, now i forgive you."""
well...
it's too late for forgiveness.
it's my turn now and paris will run with blood if anyone tries to stop me!
i'm tired.
i want to go to my room.
i'll show you.
i know where it is.
we must hurry, your highness.
your majesty, i'm so sorry.
i thought you were gaston.
he is in the dauphin's quarters.
treville's plan has worked.
gaston believes your son has been taken out of paris to safety.
where is he truly?
please tell me you know.
i don't...
of course.
they haven't told you either.
treville took him the very moment the king died.
who's with him?
i hoped it was you.
i'm so frightened for him.
your majesty, we are united in our grief.
don't you dare speak to me.
he's gone.
to talk with the duke of lorraine.
he didn't jump at your offer.
what makes you think lorraine will?
i cannot and will not give gaston what he wants, but lorraine's a different matter.
brave.
to come here.
i heard you were an honourable man.
why isn't prince gaston with you?
yet.
he's perfectly safe, your grace.
i'm here to negotiate with you.
but not that man.
he's wanted for the murder of the marquis de feron.
you speak with us both or leave.
i will hear what he's come to say.
you were keeping an eye on gaston.
he'll be back at lorraine's camp by now.
i'd like to know what's happened to the dauphin.
don't play games with me, athos.
where is he?
it's better you don't know, aramis.
you came back too quickly.
i know he must still be in paris.
he is being well cared for by people we know and trust.
who do you trust to look after the king of france?
i'd like to know if i agree with your choice.
"what happened to ""one for all""?"
you want your lands back and a treaty guaranteeing lorraine's independence from france.
france has no right to them.
louis took them by force and deception.
because of your years of plotting with gaston against the king.
and here i am plotting with gaston to take them back.
you have an army stretched fighting spain.
chaos and hunger at home.
when your men came here they had enough time to assess my forces.
they'll have told you, i'm sure, that i can take paris before you can bring reinforcements from the war.
how much do you trust your generals?
it will be bloody.
they will be slaughtering their own countrymen.
you know you cannot fully rely on their loyalty.
looks like lorraine doesn't need you.
they all need me.
they need my gold to back up their big ambitions.
they'll throw you back in the sewer once they've got what they want.
but the nobility never stop wanting, do they?
never satisfied, born greedy.
and here you are, desperate to be one of them.
end your alliance with gaston.
i have made him an offer of reconciliation.
it's a generous one, which i believe he will accept.
i can't betray my cousin.
he will have everything he wants, bar the throne.
and if he gets that, he will betray you.
we both know he will not let the new king live.
i need time to consider your offer.
at dusk, when the first candles are lit, our offer to you will be withdrawn.
how long has it been empty?
a long time.
it's where i lived with my late husband.
i never would have imagined the king sleeping here.
this is how i met d'artagnan.
he rented this room.
that was his bed.
has treville gone?
he has tricked me.
he lured me to the palace for nothing.
nothing?
no generous offer?
no reconciliation?
no legacy?
absolutely nothing.
what has he said to you?
what has he offered you?
nothing.
he's sent the dauphin away.
i saw athos and d'artagnan put him in a fast coach.
they were loading provisions for a long journey.
i will be king!
we must march on paris now.
i'm not ready.
we'll get nothing here.
treville is manoeuvring lorraine to cut me out of any deal.
his plan is to divide us and gaston is too stupid to see it.
then what are we waiting for?
the army is ready for battle.
we have no army without lorraine leading it.
we need the dauphin.
gaston thinks they've sent him out of paris but treville wouldn't take such a risk.
he won't be at the palace, not with an army waiting to descend on them.
where would you hide the dauphin?
who would you have look after him?
treville only trusts musketeers and porthos is here.
look for the others.
one of them will lead you to the boy.
i need to find athos.
he's at the palace.
but there's someone in his office waiting to see you.
your majesty.
when i found out it wasn't aramis, i knew it must be you.
your majesty...
even before i found these, i knew.
how could you carry out their plan without asking me?
because i know it's right.
you will take me to him now.
and that is a command from your queen.
treville orders me to hide him and you order me to put that at risk.
i could take him to prayers.
the church at saint-sulpice.
if you hide yourself, i'll bring him there in an hour.
on my life, you must keep your distance and he cannot see you.
we have work to do!
lucien grimaud is your master now.
we are going to hunt musketeers.
i know where to find porthos.
he's as good as dead.
there couldn't have been a worse time for louis to die.
i think he held on to his life for as long as he could, for his son.
who is in hiding somewhere... with someone.
athos?
he was right.
what do you mean?
so who has him now?
constance.
constance?
he's still resting.
what is it?
i have to take him to saint-sulpice.
it's too dangerous.
the queen has commanded me.
she was at the garrison.
constance!
i have no choice.
i'll be quick.
aramis!
where's athos?
where are they?
where?
saint-sulpice!
remember your prayers?
constance!
they've got the king.
stop them.
more men will be coming.
you should never have brought him here.
i commanded her to.
do you realise how close we were to losing him?
i'm sorry.
i might have done the same.
we were lucky.
i know you are watching over us.
always.
i hope.
i hope so too.
truly, aramis.
he'll have his men swarming all over this area.
when he was ill as a baby i brought him to a laundry.
they're good women there, but we'll need your protection.
you find the others.
i can't leave you.
you have to.
i'll look after him.
it's nearly time.
i must talk to lorraine alone.
i'm giving you authority to offer gaston an even greater fortune and joint control of the army.
just get him away.
what do you want from me?
no more secrecy!
the regent didn't want to embarrass you in front of your allies.
treville realises his earlier offer fell short of your rightful status and expectations.
he will put aside ten million livres from the royal reserve if you will accept his offer of reconciliation.
you can tell the so-called regent that when i am king, it will all be mine anyway.
i will consider further concessions if you pull your armies back.
immediately.
and then have you withdraw your offer?
i, too, am a man of honour.
it is about the imminence of the threat.
why would i do this?
a gesture, an act of conciliation.
then we could try one more time to reach an agreement.
i should have told you everything from the start.
but you didn't.
gentlemen, as happy as i am that we're all friends again,
can i go and help my wife now?
we need to stop marcheaux.
you had the king and you lost him!
without a scratch on you!
we know he's in saint antoine, now, with d'artagnan's whore.
i have men crawling all over the place.
lorraine wants to make peace.
he didn't have the stomach for the fight.
i'll use the young king to raise gaston up and destroy their precious treaty.
now search every house!
you both look exhausted.
who's the boy?
there's more for you if we can keep him safe here.
well, he must be important if you've brought a musketeer with you.
oh, he's her husband.
times are hard.
just bring us more work from the garrison.
you have my word.
i would have told you sooner, but athos made me promise.
there are red guards everywhere.
now, can you find us a hiding place?
yes!
this will work.
you need to leave immediately.
if they come here you'll both be recognised.
i warned you, didn't i?
disbanding the red guard was a bad idea.
was it?
not this one.
open the door!
search every house!
we work as normal.
we don't look round.
we have nothing to hide.
understand?
hey, what's all this?
looking for a boy.
well, no boys here, just women doing laundry.
go.
wait.
paris starves, yet the people still grovel at the king's feet.
what is it?
but what is loyalty?
is it staying quiet?
or speaking out?
did i get a rat?
the royal prize.
he's alive!
tie him up and bring him with us.
where did they go?
i don't know, but they are still alive.
if they have the king, everything treville is fighting for is lost.
i have kept my side of the bargain.
the troops have been pulled back ten leagues.
your turn.
i will recommend to the council they ratify full independence for lorraine.
i accept your offer.
what offer?
i have no idea what you're talking about.
your man offered them to me.
i'm afraid without authority.
where are our troops?
are you signing this?
i'm the rightful regent of france.
you were a tiresome and vindictive child and you haven't changed.
i have given my word.
traitor!
arrest him, porthos.
it will be my pleasure.
please.
get your filthy hands off me!
get off!
get off!
i wouldn't sign that.
this is your ally?
a man who kidnaps a child?
are you all right, sire?
you owe me.
i owe you nothing.
you have no morals or conscience.
to hell with you and gaston.
there.
it is signed.
that was a mistake.
you shouldn't have moved your troops.
who's going to protect you now?
sire, run!
this way!
get the horses!
gaston!
take him.
go!
no!
no, no, no, no, no!
no, no, no.
treville.
the king?
oh gu tak, where are you now?
so you want to send a mad dog like me to help you get even with the guy who stabbed your son to death?
pak ung cheol's strength, jeong tae su's skill, lee jeong mun's intellect.
mix those together right and there isn't a criminal under the sun we couldn't catch.
why did you agree to this?
i discovered something suspicious.
i told you not to act like you're better than me!
didn't an elder ask you first?
if one of you manages to catch the killer, his prison sentence will be reduced by 5 years.
nice to meet you, jeong mun.
we are a team from now on.
first, get that animal arrested.
what might the killer's motive be for murder?
let's get started.
all of these were from last year, july to november.
these were home break-in murders that happened in that area of seoul.
15 victims.
you should have stayed and protected her.
are your eyes and ears plugged with sausage?
stop!
hurry and catch that bastard.
that's enough, tae su!
that bastard can't die by your hand.
this house is near geumdang 4 road.
ajussi, come quickly, please.
there's a church before you get here.
=first calm down, then say it again.=
i just locked the door!
what happened, miss?
no matter how busy you are, you must take time to eat.
i'll eat well, commissioner.
do you know why an apple a day is so good for you?
i heard if you eat an apple in the morning, it speeds up your metabolism.
maybe it's because you peeled it yourself, but it's quite tasty, commissioner.
eat some more.
as much as you eat is how much you have to put out.
what do you mean by that?
since the citizens give their hard- earned money to fill your stomach, then whether it's shit or soybean paste, you have to put out something!
i'm sorry, commissioner.
i will definitely correct it right away!
four hours!
your unit and all the gadgets they brought along wasted 4 hours!
that murdering bastard was able to kill the victim and then got away!
if your unit had arrived on the scene sooner, you would have been able to catch the murderer and that woman would not be dead!
and recently, there have been rumors of mobster activity there, so there was some difficulty gaining entry to the crime scene.
difficulty?
is that something a policeman should say?
leave.
get the hell out!
yes, commissioner!
it's me.
have you been well?
of course i have.
shouldn't i be?
you must resent me, don't you?
resent you?
that's human nature i suppose.
but i'm not the kind to hold a grudge.
tae su, be careful of making a u-turn in life.
one u-turn back into old habits, and you'll wander aimlessly the rest of your life.
it's my life, so don't worry about it.
i can't believe this.
you deposit and withdraw me as you wish.
you're coming out anyway, so don't try any tricks, ung cheol.
tricks?
say that again.
you're coming out, so just shut up and follow orders, you bastard.
how many people did you kill with those fists?
then you will be a free man.
you, lee jeong mun...
i have a hard time reading you.
i might as well feed meat to the dog.
so, are you in or out?
do i really have a choice?
from the beginning the choice has been yours, not ours.
then i'll just assume that you agreed.
you asked me what i was thinking about, right?
you know what's funny?
every time i see you, oh gu tak,
i wonder the same thing about you...
just what are you thinking?
dad, what are you thinking about?
what are you thinking about, dad?
am i your daughter or your maid?
will she meet any boys who will break her heart?
whoever breaks my little girl's heart,  will most likely live a very difficult life,  because their body will be broken.
you'll beat them up?
you're not a policeman, but a gangster!
a gangster!
and i just don't know why some lady hasn't snatched up a man like you.
you know i don't want to remarry!
but you need to!
find yourself a sexy ajumma.
just go on a date!
then she can go to movies and out to eat, that's even better.
dad, don't tell me...
don't tell me you're going to try to run my life and haunt me forever!
how can you say that i'm trying to run your life?
anyway, be sure to come home early today.
your dad's going to make the army base stew that you like so much.
really?
we are here now, squad leader oh gu tak, to determine whether you should be suspended as punishment.
do you have any objections to offer regarding this suspension?
i asked whether you have any objections.
i have a question of my own.
are we men or beasts?
if the people hunting the beasts end up getting eaten by them, the hunters eventually become beasts themselves.
what do you expect me to do?
it doesn't seem like you have reflected on this at all, squad leader oh gu tak.
however, i... am not someone with the luxury for self-reflection.
=oh gu tak=-
hope is a drug.
are you all ready to go hunting?
of course everything, including the existence of this team... and all of your activities must remain a secret.
once the perpetrators have been caught, you will all return to prison.
but as soon as a new case comes along, you will leave the prison again and go back into the field.
catch the criminals, reduce your sentence.
this cycle, over and over.
of course, once your prison term has been completely erased, you will have your freedom, as promised.
"this thing called ""freedom""..."
it's much more difficult to keep it than to obtain it.
so even though i have given you guys your freedom, it's up to each of you to guard that freedom.
by depriving them of their freedom you can guard yours.
understand?
first, go take a look at the crime scene.
inspector yu.
it's over there.
that woman...
where is she now?
how would she be after suffering something like that?
if that woman dies, you will die.
the victim's name is sin su jeong.
24 years old, a university student.
it happened two nights ago, on july 26th around 2 am.
the victim was returning home from her part-time job down this road.
she passed geumdang 4 road.
the perpetrator imprisoned the victim in this room.
the perpetrator then left the room to prepare for the rest of the crime.
it's a dismembered body case?
but when he was ready to proceed to the second step, the criminal found something unexpected.
the victim had regained consciousness and locked the door.
she had already called the police.
yes, this house is near geumdang 4 road.
i'vebeenkidnapped.
ajussi, come quickly, please!
we know that the perpetrator broke through the door and entered.
please let me go.
from the rental records, we were able to find out a bit about the criminal's identity.
yang si cheol.
yang si cheol cut sin su jeong's body into more than 300 pieces.
after that, he fled the crime scene.
catch this guy named yang si cheol.
okay, got it.
something is strange.
what is?
it's your brain that's strange.
how could he not know that she called the police... in such a small house?
he must have known she called the police.
so knowing that, this guy, yang si cheol, leisurely cut her up into 300 pieces and then ran away?
things don't match up, do they?
this bastard must never do any cleaning.
what do you mean it doesn't match?
but, what jumps out at us is an unexpected variable in this equation.
to dismember a second, unidentified victim.
during that time, sin su jeong woke up and had time to call the police.
the body was cut into more than 300 pieces.
to be precise, 356 pieces.
that's definitely out of the ordinary, isn't it?
he not only dismembered her body, but all of the internal organs are missing too.
they don't know for sure what chemicals he used on her face, but it was damaged to the point that she was completely unrecognizable.
right.
selling human organs on the black market and the bones to hospitals.
that bastard yang si cheol is involved in the business of human body parts.
it's been two days.
no matter what, we must find sin su jeong.
first, we have to find that woman.
then we will hunt down yang si cheol, and then i'll chew that rotten bastard's bones up.
get busy setting up the workshop as soon as possible.
i want to do away with the flesh and organs at the same time.
i heard you saw the victim's father.
how could he be?
not very good.
these victims... as long as you believe they're still alive, you can find them alive.
what do you mean by that?
it all depends on a person's will.
if you hold fast to the belief she is still alive, then sometimes it works out the way you hope it will.
work hard.
where are you going?
have you found anything?
that person has been standing there for more than 20 minutes.
maybe he lives nearby.
if a person saw someone being kidnapped, what would they do?
either be scared and run away, or call the police.
it's like he knew what was going to happen.
he's an accomplice?
i'm surprised to meet in a place like this so early in the evening, prosecutor jang.
you have to come earlier to get the younger girls.
if you come too late then you don't know if you're touching a woman or a squid.
but squad leader oh, are the young girls okay with you?
i'll get you a slender young lady.
how old is your daughter now?
i'm very sorry.
i get so busy with work, sometimes my memory isn't good.
it's all right.
i'll pretend it's a wedding gift for seo jin, and deliver it to you in a beautiful package.
i'll call you back later, hyeongnim.
yes...
why do you hit them every time you come, hyeongnim?
i was already on a call!
even making me come here in person.
here.
kidney consultation?
what are you doing, hyeongnim?
=fc future communications=-
here.
could you help me find out the call history on this phone?
the owner is a foreigner.
from southeast asia.
customer, does this look like a phone used in southeast asia?
you must think i'm an idiot.
i've already looked into this myself.
the foreigner's identity was stolen.
we're only a small communications company.
we're not a company that provides burner phones.
they took 8 today.
burner phones.
you don't want to tell me easily.
i didn't want to do it this way, but let's go.
you bastard...
this bastard...
people there sell copies of foreign passports to create fake identities for phones.
b-but i do know the phone number.
prosecutor, you've had too much to drink.
a little too much...
young ladies, please disappear now.
where are you going?
you really drank a lot, didn't you?
oh gu tak, are you crazy?
i don't have much time.
oh gu tak, what...
among the people who give you bribes, there are human traffickers, right?
what are you talking about?
there are far more corrupt prosecutors than just you, prosecutor jang.
what's the problem?
don't be so stiff-necked.
act natural, punk.
yes.
i suddenly seem to have a bit of a stiff neck.
never mind.
understood, hyeongnim.
are you yun cheol ju?
i'm not yun cheol ju.
if you aren't yun cheol ju, why do you have yun cheol ju's cell phone?
basically, my insides are rotten to the core.
i have high blood pressure and diabetes.
it's the truth.
your skin seems healthy.
people often say what nice skin i have.
but i don't bathe often, so i smell rather strong...
do you want to die?
you can't say no at this point.
follow me.
height 170 to 175.
black v-neck tee shirt, gray coat, cargo pants.
begin.
start heading toward your 9 o'clock.
at geumdang 2 road, go toward 12 o'clock.
why do you keep looking back?
the roads in this neighborhood are really complicated.
just follow me.
you will see a fork in the road ahead.
on geumdang 4 road, head toward the 1 o'clock direction.
hey, where did he go?
what should we do about cheol ju hyeong?
if we don't do this right, they might take his organs...
he'll become an organ donor!
i don't know who it was.
over there!
over there!
hanging up.
=geumdang 8 road=-
the accomplice is hiding on this block.
how do you and president choe ji dong know each other?
we're nodding acquaintances.
is president choe still only selling foreign identities for burner phones?
the economy is bad these days.
oh well, that president choe is too stubborn.
what is that woman doing?
getting ideas?
she's starting to spoil, so i plan to sell her off.
i bundle a few of them together for a sale.
if they get lucky, they'll be sold somewhere locally.
if their luck isn't so good, they'll end up on some island.
if their luck gets worse,
you know?
organ donors.
organ trafficking.
anyway, don't look for her.
i'll get you a fresh, juicy one.
there are plenty of women in this building.
it looks like you already do well in that department.
although the place a bit shabby, come and sit down.
okay, let's have a look...
yang si cheol.
spoil?
fresh?
is a person just meat, punk?
if you consider yourself a human, stop before you go too far.
please.
after i get rid of this guy, i'll be back.
help me to track these two numbers.
0 103 045...
whose number is this?
yang si cheol's cellphone number.
this is inspector yu mi yeong from the seoul national police agency.
i need you to track a cellphone number.
after 10:00, even the police are afraid to go in this place.
i'm not the police, so it's fine, man.
hyeongnim, we still can't go in there.
if those north koreans in there take you, you'll lose your life!
then should we just watch while cheol ju loses his life?
do you know why gangsters these days are called thugs?
because they're always only looking out for themselves, so they're afraid to do anything.
we're born empty-handed and we die empty-handed, so why be afraid?
at a time like this, would i come for the lamb?
seems like you and i came here for the same reason.
but ung cheol, do you know what will happen if you go in there and it goes wrong?
you will die.
everybody has to die some time.
bastard, you really have diarrhea of the mouth sometimes.
if you think your life is too valuable, because you have a lot of things to protect, then stay behind.
don't be a burden.
you're indebted to your parents when you're born, indebted to the bank when you're alive, and indebted to your children when you die.
a life forever indebted to others...
i've got nothing to lose, either.
then should we go in together?
=roast lamb kebab=-
now that we're at the door, are you worried?
if worrying could take away my worries, then i'd have nothing to worry about.
i have a little business to handle.
sit down.
since you're here, do you want the money?
probably less than $5000.
i don't think that's enough.
i can come back another time.
you can use the rest to buy your wife some delicious food.
let's do it.
i smoke and drink way too much.
how can you eat in a place like this?
hyeongnim!
hyeongnim...
why are you lying there like that?
are you getting a massage?
don't you know what kind of place this is?
this is a public bath, you country hick.
i thought i had done a lot of bad things, but you are getting a beating one by one.
you bunch of whore-raised bastards.
you'd better watch your mouth.
this dead son of a bitch, shut his stinking mouth!
lee mun gi, there's only one thing i want to hear coming out of your mouth.
if that explodes... everyone here will be dead.
you know that, right?
doesn't the person who shits, also know where the hole is?
you're not afraid of dying?
yang si cheol.
where can i find that guy?
yeah, talk.
boss lee?
okay, i got it.
workplace?
i understand.
you also hurry and come over.
see you soon.
get started on our job.
the workspace has been prepared already.
our situation isn't very good right now, so please be understanding.
if something happens to me, you just wait and see.
bye.
the woman?
i heard she's still alive.
they're going to start right away.
where is that place?
where is yang si cheol?
bastard, do you want to die?
is anyone inside?
he died because of you.
who told you to disobey me?
we found the location of the number you sent.
yang si cheol is there right now.
=we must find sin su jeong before she dies.=
=i need all of you to be focused.=
i had some business, so i'm out of town right now.
just because i'm not around, don't skip your meals.
ji suk, i'm sorry i'm not there to take proper care of you.
i know, i know.
i love you, too.
i'll call you later.
let's begin.
come here, you psycho asshole!
you fucking psycho, get up!
you deserve a spanking.
you asshole.
as a human being, there are lines you shouldn't cross.
playing dead, fucking bastard?
that son of a bitch...
that will give you capital to start a business.
squad leader oh, you said she would be alive when we found her.
she was really alive.
after all those bad things you've done, does it feel good to save a life?
bastards.
true happiness, is whenever you're feeling happy, making others around you happy, as well.
that's how you should be as a human.
the way you're feeling right now, don't forget it and remember it.
that's how you become a human.
tae su, that woman is at this hospital.
go see her.
let me take a pee, will you!
are we going back to prison now?
what's going on?
i recognize this flash drive from the water damage.
henry probably has them halfway across the world by now.
i'm gonna put a bullet in henry wilcox's head.
i sent someone over to his place to check on him but he wasn't there.
the bombing that henry was behind in turbaco that killed teo's mom, this is the first i'm hearing any of it.
i was working under henry when it happened.
i don't want him thinking i was involved.
why don't you tell him yourself when i bring him home?
it just gives henry more time to plot his next move.
we've got to find a way to stop this cycle.
i'm surprised they let you back in denmark after what happened last time.
i'd be forced to call the fbi, the nsa, and the dni's office.
if i was following protocol, there'd already be a mark on your record so permanent, even if you were absolved of any wrong-doing, you'd be lucky to get a job at the dmv.
i'm trying to keep your breach inside the family, and this dungeon is your opportunity to explain yourself before i'm forced to put you in the kind of custody that there's no way out of.
auggie, a picture is starting to form, and it ain't pretty.
♪ covert affairs 04x09 ♪ hang wire original air date on september 10, 2013
auggie, you're still not answering.
unfortunately, my flight was delayed and i don't have his cell phone number.
well, the whole solstar team is actually at the tivoli gardens presently, scheduled for a photo op.
it's costing too many people too much to keep my secrets.
if you want to stop me, you should be prepared to take better aim with that gun this time.
i think we have something to learn from one another, don't you?
over the years you were supporting him, what kind of terrorist activities was he involved in?
so i assume 'cause you're still here, you're ready to talk.
you know what was almost as interesting as what i found in your place?
i warned you about a handler sleeping with his operative.
and here we go.
did you ever imagine that you'd spend this much energy trying to save my life?
i want to know who did that, and i want to know why seth newman was in possession of it.
i mean, telling the world arthur's got a bastard son is no fun if it's only good for gossip.
beautiful woman tells you that she doesn't want to lose you, and you still jump off a rooftop?
i know how hard it is not to want to lash out in anger.
100 knives at this price is an unbelievable deal.
now, listen, you'd pay more than twice this amount if you bought these exact knives in a store.
this deal can't be beat.
no, no.
actually it's the worst morning in the history of mornings.
well, you are a very capable investigator.
"""retinal scanner uses wavefront-sensing reflection points..."""
"""...correlates the data using a point spread function..."""
"yeah. ""...rasterizes the pupil conjugate-geometry."""
the eyeball from the port-to-port killer unlocked mtac's retinal scanner.
yes, i know that, mcgee.
but it's been put on the back burner for now.
agent barrett and her team left for hawaii last night, following a new lead.
use mine.
wow, that's heavy.
answer it.
looks like the port-to-port killer is back on the front burner.
uh, there's the usual lack of defensive wounds.
but from his skin color, well it... tells me that not more than 12 hours.
and for the grand finale a six-centimeter cut, ear to ear, severing the carotid artery.
and as partners, your very lives depended on your trust in one another.
yeah, i'd hate to be in your killer's shoes when anthony's catch up with him.
well, the same type of blade as the prior murders was used on his neck.
again, the body has been scrubbed vigorously, and the characteristic manicure.
i suppose it is possible that anthony's relation to him is, uh, merely coincidental.
not when i knew him, but, uh... a few years after i left for ncis,
okay, let's say you and i hadn't spoken in years, and i get my throat slit by a serial killer.
i would hunt him down and make him regret the day he was born.
i'm agent mcgee from ncis.
you're the one that didn't tell the department that your, uh, ncis was running an op.
what's the best way to earn instant bona fides then, uh, getting pinched?
old friends and tv dinners, things i messed up, things right in front of my face i should have seen.
and then, joey peanuts, you get to do five years of community service, if you're lucky.
it's really sad how tony and his old partner drifted so far apart.
so, to find the copycat, we are analyzing publicly available tax receipts, looking for people who bought three or more of the items that are in the port-to-port killer's toolbox.
all right, well, let me run facial recognition against our crime scene photos.
you know, man, i got enough on my hands worrying about that franklin guy.
well, it'd be nice to have ballistics tying this guy to the murder, but that sounds like a confession to me.
didn't want us to tip our hand in case he wasn't working alone.
his name's lieutenant ian floyd.
he's a disbursing officer at a navy payroll office in quantico.
we should check to see when ballistics on the murder weapon's going to be done.
we've been waiting for ballistics for over a week.
detective dinozzo's personnel file is right here.
my ulcer's killing me again.
i'm telling you, this stomach is going to be the death of me.
roscoe, go ahead.
let's hope our copycat's home.
oh, my god, this is so exciting.
you also have the right to an attorney so he can tell you how you weren't hugged enough as a child.
i'm the worst loser on the entire planet.
i haven't even started yet, and i got arrested.
that's what uncle tickle fingers always said.
practice makes perfect.
you got the wrong guy, bucko.
actually, i came all the way here because of what i saw in floyd's eyes when you got the drop on him.
something that i spent the last two days trying to pretend i didn't see.
there's only one reason you never mentioned it.
i was sending potential clients... in floyd's direction.
so how much did you get to keep your mouth shut on a homicide, danny?
no, no, tony, i had no idea that floyd was our guy.
so i'm gonna take a walk.
i'm in a shoot-first, ask-questions-later frame of mind.
what am i gonna do?
danny ...things i messed up, things right in front of my face i should have seen.
but i'm not the only one who saw what he wanted to.
son of a bitch.
followed me again.
another hunch?
no, but i could see you had one.
danny was dirty.
i always wondered why the money launderer didn't rat him out, try to cut a deal.
there's only one reason to be afraid of sending a dirty cop to jail.
"""better late than never"" is right."
i think he was looking for redemption.
well, let's go give it to him.
look at what the cat dragged in.
your evidence locker logs.
danny was right.
what are you talking about?
major, you knew that dinozzo wasn't going to let it go.
dropped another body on the port-to-port pile.
did you think i would just assume it was a serial killer?
let me ask you what do you see when you look in the mirror?
could you imagine having to arrest gibbs?
however, we have another problem.
remember i told you about that e-mail from abby concerning the typo in my report?
presumably someone who wanted us to know we were chasing a copycat killer.
and there's only one person that could have been.
i got it.
you made it.
yeah.
it's your partner.
ex-partner.
maybe being a cop isn't for me.
thanks.
don't make a habit of that.
did i mention you're a devious man, gibbs?
caught a huge striped bass.
we're having it mounted in my office.
isn't that right, mr. lewicki?
so, even if my soon-to-be form teaching assistant didn't roll over on me like a rat in a bad mafia flick, you'd know i was lying.
studies show the most convincing liars land the best jobs, make the most friends, and get all the hot women.
so if i was really good at it, would there still be a way for you to bust me?
did you discover a male intruder in your home last night?
yes.
a polygraph's not a bad tool, but it only measures stress response.
in this class, we're interested in what goes on in the brain.
because we use our brains when we lie.
we use our brains when we're being lied to.
what am i supposed to tell him?
i don't know.
use your dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and make something up.
okay, so you want me to lie for you now?
think of it as practice.
for what?
for landing a new job when i fire you for not getting me out of the meeting with dean haley.
doc, that doesn't make any sense.
in a bit of a hurry, aren't we?
i'm gonna pay for your dry cleaning, okay?
in fact, could we please make the lady another?
chamomile tea.
good choice.
i don't think you need any more caffeine.
actually, the tea is for a friend, and i can handle my caffeine just fine.
thank you very much.
7:00's good for me.
thank you for the tea, and again, i'm very sorry about the shirt.
daniel.
kate.
not yet.
actually, she cost him a bundle.
mail-order bride from the ukraine.
people actually do that?
no.
"""eastern bloc introductions""."
they arranged for frank to fly to odessa to meet with prospective brides.
before you know it, wedding bells.
but frank has to come home while they wait for olena's visa.
immigration problems.
then he gets a call from her broker saying it's gonna be another 100 grand to get olena into the states.
now, frank doesn't have that kind of cash.
so then the broker offers him alternative financing.
"code for ""loan shark""."
so frank gets his new bride, but he can't keep up with the payments.
so then the loan shark tells him that they're going to take olena and make her work off the debt.
suspected of running the largest prostitution and loan-sharking operations in the midwest.
the bureau's been trying to nail this guy for years, but no one will testify.
he also happens to own eastern bloc introductions.
so it's a front company.
yeah.
we think that the loan shark's one of tupelov's boys, and last night he made good on his threat.
frank comes home, sees a blue camaro parked right outside his house.
they fight.
the guy smashes frank over the head with a lamp.
how can i help?
well, you said the intruder hit him over the head.
that could certainly affect his memory.
he can describe everything that happened last night in perfect detail, so how is it that he can't tell us what this guy looked like?
it wasn't here last time.
yeah.
daniel!
where are you going?
do you have any idea the health risks those things pose?
wh..
according to who?
some government regulatory body?
like i really trust uncle sam to look out for my well-being.
okay, listen, what exactly is it that you're afraid of?
skin cancer, thyroid disease, mutated sperm.
not to mention the violation of privacy.
mr. prentice, you told the police that you struggled with the intruder for more than a minute, that you were face-to-face the whole time.
any distinguishing features or characteristics?
well, i told them i've never been too good with faces.
well, they were about the same size.
we find this girl, and then what?
why?
just do it.
okay.
and take these.
now, let's do something about that hair.
frank, this is miss jones.
she's gonna come up with a composite of the man who attacked you.
have we met?
it's sensory impairment called prosopagnosia..
"also known as ""face blindness""."
even though frank's vision is perfectly normal, he can't recognize faces.
he probably couldn't pick his own mother out of a lineup.
because of the blow to the head?
it can be caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus, but frank said he'd never been good with faces, which means it's probably congenital.
how's that even possible?
most prosopagnosiacs develop unconscious strategies for recognizing the people they know..
the way they dress, the context they see them in, their voice.
great.
well, according to frank's statement, the intruder never spoke, so even if we find the guy, our witness can't i.d. him.
mm, frank spoke to the loan shark at least half a dozen times.
he'd be able to recognize his voice.
we find the loan shark, get daniel to help frank i.d. him.
we grill his sorry ass until he tells us where olena is.
can i go now?
frank couldn't pick anybody out of the photo array.
we know that your company is a front for alexei tupelov.
so, you two are running quite a scam..
and if they don't pay, you force their immigrant wives into prostitution.
that's ridiculous.
olena prentice..
one of tupelov's boys threatened to take her as collateral, and now she's missing.
that sounds like conspiracy to commit kidnapping and extortion to me.
does that sound like extortion to you, roger?
i don't know anything about kidnapping or prostitution.
and if you ask me, olena went back to ukraine.
you think she went home?
a few weeks after she got here, she called me to say that frank was very mean to her.
he did not let her leave the house.
i'm a marriage broker, not a marriage counselor.
i told her to stick it out, to stay a few years, then divorce him, take his money.
there is an innocent young girl missing who came to this country trying to make a better life for herself.
what do you want from me?
i want the name of the man who was shaking frank down.
what makes you think that i..
if you don't give me a name, this place is gonna be swarming with i.c.e. agents, u.s. attorneys, i.r.s.
you will go to federal prison, kicking yourself for not cooperating with that nice girl from the fbi when you had the chance.
yuri petrovich?
i got all the women i need right here.
never heard of no olena.
okay, thanks.
a body matching the description of olena prentice was just found in a landfill out by midway.
paul, you wanted to see..
i've been trying to convince michael to bring his talents to the south side and become the newest member of our esteemed faculty.
it's an honor.
well, my academic specialty's behavioral science, of course.
"the ""sage"" part was my publicists' idea."
you know, michael's had a new york times bestseller three years running.
i've read all your books.
yeah, in fact, when paul rang with his offer, i said i'd only consider it if it meant a chance to work with you.
uh, i read your last book, too.
doc.
maybe i can help you, professor.
it's better for everyone..
a mole.
i hear you are a very smart man, professor.
after all, you don't want to also disappear, do you?
number 2.
why him?
i recognize that widow's peak, those scrawny, bowed legs.
i want that bastard to pay for what he did to my wife.
daniel, can you testify in court that the visual i.d. is valid despite mr. prentice's condition?
i'm gonna lay it out for you, yuri.
frank prentice just fingered you as the man who threatened to abduct his wife.
what do you make?
$40,000, $45,000 a year?
you're a hot little spinner.
an innocent girl was killed, yuri.
now, in addition to the fact that it really pisses me off, it's also murder during the commission of a felony.
do you know what that means?
death penalty.
yeah, the medical examiner says that she died from a blow to the base of the skull.
maybe she was trying to get away.
maybe she fell, hit her head.
you're offering me a deal, just because you're sweet on me?
you're too small for me, yuri..
no, i want something bigger.
i want alexei tupelov.
bitch, what are you smoking?
i rat out tupelov, i might as well get the death penalty.
okay.
we've already got you on the extortion.
it's up to five years for each count.
do you think he's gonna give us tupelov?
it would help if we could connect him to the crime scene.
any luck on the blue camaro?
yuri drives an escalade.
i doubt yuri and his boys would be stupid enough to commit kidnapping in a registered car.
that pendant.
yuri petrovich has one just like it.
well, i grew up with a lot of the guys in tupelov's crew.
so, what do you think?
did yuri really kill olena?
who else could have done it?
well, let's just say some friends of mine would be very grateful if you didn't help moretti pin this murder on yuri.
not me, professor.
daniel.
you're being threatened by a russian mobster, and you don't bother mentioning it to kate?
why not?
because he's probably a damned hallucination..
because i might be wrong!
daniel, you and i both know that feeling threatened by a criminal conspiracy straight out of a spy novel is classic schizophrenic delusion.
what's more plausible..
you said this thug told you that it wasn't healthy for you to keep working for the fbi.
you just disappeared out of their lives.
so, i'm not afraid of ukrainian gangsters so much as orderlies with butterfly nets?
you're not going back to the hospital.
some days i manage better than others.
the ukrainian guy said there was a mole.
now, it's not the agent, obviously.
well, maybe it's a riddle.
what's a mole?
a spy, an imposter, someone who hides in plain sight.
wha..
that scumbag is anything but innocent, but that does not make him the killer.
but you just proved that prosopagnosiacs can i.d. people by their voice or their posture or whatever.
he would have known his own wife.
maybe she was wearing some kind of disguise.
maybe she was trying to get away from him.
you said yourself how awful he is.
the marriage broker did say that she wanted out.
so he tracks the ungrateful bitch down, and he kills her.
so, uh, frank thought she was kidnapped, so maybe he didn't realize that she'd run away until after he took the polygraph.
nice.
except the medical examiner puts her time of death before he took the exam.
i'm sure you'll sleep the sleep of the just knowing that..
that the puzzle's been solved and that you've nailed the right guy for the murder.
well, i am awake already.
may i help you?
so, you're the one who found mr. prentice unconscious?
yes.
come home from movies.
see him on floor with blood.
i call ambulance.
i see you're packing.
you won't be staying on with mr. prentice?
doesn't sound like olena was very happy with mr. prentice.
mr. prentice not let her go anywhere.
he say it is not safe, but he work always until very late.
until i come, olena was alone.
did he ever hurt her?
do you think it's possible she wasn't kidnapped..
daniel.
"""thanks for taking care of this, baby."
who's jolene?
i never hear this name.
well, whoever she is, frank's paying her credit-card bills.
jolene grey?
thank you for agreeing to come talk to us.
okay.
you cooperate with us, and, uh, we'll do what we can to keep things discreet.
now, this is some tab you've run up here.
fancy hotels, jewelry, cash advances.
i lost my wallet a few months ago.
someone must have stolen my i.d. and opened this account.
yeah, see, that's not really the way identity theft works, jolene.
criminals run up tabs under someone else's name, and then they don't pay the bill.
my husband took away my credit cards last year.
i don't know any frank prentice.
i thought you were gonna cooperate, jolene.
now, according to your cellphone records, you've called frank several times a day for the past few months.
after all, you wouldn't want frank's number showing up on your husband's bill.
or maybe you were jealous of frank's wife.
maybe used one of those cash advances to pay someone to make olena prentice disappear.
i don't know what you're talking about.
check out those heels.
must have cost her a fortune.
tell me the truth, jolene.
where did you get those shoes?
i am so sorry.
and did you need those shoes so badly that you stole money to buy them?
yes.
i thought that's what this was about.
i'll pay back every penny.
please.
don't tell my husband.
compulsive buying disorder.
one of our agents showed jolene's photo to the desk clerk at the hotel where the gold card was used.
said he's never seen her before.
but a different woman checked in regularly using jolene's name, met frank there.
"both women have black hair, but according to the desk clerk, the other one is ""way hotter""."
what are you talking about?
she made charges every tuesday and thursday last month at a place called the red rabble.
that's a bar off i-90.
daniel?
a blue camaro.
the same type of car parked outside of olena's the night she disappeared.
excuse me!
hi, everybody!
yeah, that's my car.
i didn't..
i loved her.
i got a side gig installing satellite dishes.
it pays for my music.
a couple months ago, i put in a dish at olena's house.
she was lonely.
we talked and started seeing each other.
she would never spend the night.
she always had to get home before frank did.
she told me that she was gonna leave him.
well, maybe you realized that was never gonna happen, so you got angry and you killed her.
she didn't pick up her phone.
i got scared that frank maybe found out about us and maybe he hurt her.
i drove over.
but olena wasn't there.
and then frank came in.
and he turned on the lights.
and then i got the hell out of there.
super-hottie, black hair.
comes to see you play every thursday night at the red rabble.
lots of people come to hear us.
are you thinking what i'm thinking?
except jolene was having an affair with olena's husband, frank.
now, it cannot just be a coincidence.
i bet you know who the mole is now.
i don't know any jolene grey.
mr. prentice, can you help us i.d. this woman?
there anything about her that's familiar to you?
well, maybe her name will ring a bell..
are you saying somebody killed her?
actually, the real jolene grey is very much alive.
yeah, she lives out in the 'burbs with her family.
this woman stole her identity.
she wore a wig to make sure you wouldn't recognize her..
very much like this one.
i'll bet you recognize her now.
you put a wig on a corpse?
what kind of sick..
that's olena.
you can't really blame her for wanting a boy toy when she was having to sleep with you as herself and as jolene.
olena was never abducted, frank.
the reason nobody could find her is that when you killed the woman you thought was your mistress, you'd really just murdered your own wife.
i tried to end it with her.
but jolene wouldn't listen, you know?
then she started to hit me.
i lost it.
"don't ""hey, paul"" me."
you know, you really blew it with hathaway.
why would you want a fraud like that on the faculty, anyway?
that fraud is an academic superstar.
here.
now, you're gonna apologize to hathaway, and you're gonna invite him to tonight's game as a peace offering.
frank prentice is taking a plea and cooperating against yuri.
and if we can get yuri to roll on tupelov, then we'll have the ukrainians and olena's killer in one shot.
do you like baseball?
i mean, who doesn't like a cold beer and a hot dog at a ballgame, right?
have fun.
crowds drive me crazy.
hi.
i could ask you the same question.
last chance to buy me that drink.
i leave town tomorrow.
i don't think i can.
actually, um..
do you like baseball?
because i'd rather watch it on tv..
with you.
it's olena.
i guess she had everyone fooled.
foul ball down the third-base side.
out of play.
i don't believe it.
she took that asshole?
and he catches a foul ball.
you know how many games i went to as a kid, and i never once caught a foul ball?
daniel, you have no one to blame but yourself.
that could have been you.
but instead, you let him take your place.
are you trying to ruin her date?
you taking everything?
no one's accusing you of stealing.
olena?
we don't blame you for wanting to make him pay.
what we couldn't figure out was how you did it all on your own.
i don't know what you're talking..
ever since we were little girls in ukraine, paulina protect me.
she married american, too, five years before, but she divorce him, stay in country.
it was so good to see her.
she stayed for a few days.
but soon we notice something strange.
when next time she come to visit, he not recognize her, even though he know her.
that's when she realized he was face-blind.
and she make plan to get his money.
but first she need new name so he doesn't get suspicious.
he's not used to beautiful woman paying attention to him, so he give her money, jewels, anything she want.
for me, it get worse.
i want to run away.
paulina is stronger than me.
it's an ingenious plan.
you were threatened by a known associate of the tupelov organization.
i can make a pretty good case that you belong in witness protection.
daniel!

no way, not as good as you.
i hope you make it.
what're you gonna do with all your money?
oh, probably just save it.
yeah, that's real smart.
well, back to my book.
peter, i was at the park with stewie, and someone stole his tricycle.
and during, like, the one second
i was looking down at my phone and not at him.
stupid thief.
it's got a vanity plate that won't even apply to him.
hey.
you like your reggae watered down and acceptable at a wedding?
hop on.
ugh, can't believe somebody stole stewie's trike.
i only had nine payments left on that thing.
don't worry, lois, i'm gonna find that tricycle.
i'll just have four to five beers to stop the shaking, and then i'll go outside.
huh, never seen that kid around the neighborhood.
maybe he's got something to do with it.
hey, kid.
you know anything about a tricycle that just got stolen from the park?
no, sir, i've been sitting here for the last three hours selling lemonade.
would you like an ice-cold glass?
why, sure.
ow...
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say...
peter, peter!
we can't arrest him.
if anything, they can arrest you.
hey, here's the tricycle.
you were right, peter.
this kid's a thief.
we did it!
wow, look at us.
hey, you know, we make a great team, guys.
like huey lewis and the jews.

sorry, the band's breaking up.
here you go, stewie.
don't bother sniffing the seat.
it don't smell like nothing.
oh, yeah, my trike.
eh, i'm kind of over that thing.
now i'm way into wooden beads you move along wires.
whoa...
oh, yeah...
boy, when you find a baby's tricycle, it feels like there's nothing you can't do.
man, i wish we could quit our jobs and solve children's crimes full-time.
i heard you guys are good at solving cases.
i'll give you 50 cents to find my lucky baseball card.
guys, we're in business.
oh, wait a minute, i didn't notice you have a pierced ear.
we can't help you.
all right, guys, this'll be the headquarters for our new detective agency.
piece of junk.
i guess all our detective agency needs now is a name.
well, we're detectives solving children's crimes.
there's only one name that makes sense.
"""dicks for kids""?"
"""dicks for kids."""
but wait, we want people to know we're grown-ups.
"okay, ""big dicks for kids."""
but we don't want to sound too old.
they're gonna think we're a bunch of old, bald geezers.
"""big hairy dicks for kids."""
"how are we gonna let them know we're ""veiny""?"
so, you say this gumball machine took your dime and didn't give you a gumball?
that's right.
well, i'll take care of that.
hand over the dime, buddy.
come on, hand it over.
don't make this hard on yourself.
wait a minute.
this gumball machine takes quarters, not dimes.
holy crap, it's a setup.
time to make a quick getaway.
you were set up, too, huh?
yeah.
you realize that kid is plowing both our wives right now.
so what do we got today, boys?
well, it seems like we got a bit of a crime spree.
just this morning, we've had multiple reports of stolen items.
uh, couple marbles, ball of yarn, two wiffle ball bats.
someday a rain'll come and wash all this scum off the streets.
guys, i think i've got a lead on all these thefts.
one of the kids had a nanny-cam hidden in his room.
come on, let's do it on your son's tiny bed.
hurry, he gets home at 3:00.
okay, it's later than this.
y-yeah, f-fast-forward ahead.
keep forwarding.
is that woman gonna be okay?
yeah, yeah, she's fine.
we're having brunch after this.
god, i look huge in that bed, don't i?
you think other guys hang out and watch their friend's naked gyrating butt?
it's been so long, i don't know what other friends do.
forwarding, forwarding, forwarding...
and there we go.
our thief.
chris gaines was garth brooks.
i just figured that out.
oh, my god, chris stole all that stuff.
no way, he wouldn't do that.
peter, chris is on the tape.
we got to search his bedroom.
fine, go ahead.
but i'm telling you, it's gonna be a bigger waste of time than writing tough-guy dialogue for a jet li movie.
this is your last warning.
give me back my wife.
give me back my wife, or you're in a lot of trouble.
i'll kick all your faces.
you got me?
you're kind of undoing everything you just did when you kicked my ass.
i know, but i have to say for audience.
chris still has an aaron hernandez poster up?
that's not cool.
just a weird life-sized lady doll made out of all the stuff that got stolen.
no!
don't hurt heather.
don't hurt my girlfriend.
what the hell?
!
your kid's got a walk-in closet?
two of mine gotta sleep in the car.
chris is still in his room with that disgusting homemade sex doll.
he actually thinks it's his girlfriend.
i know, it's weird.
it's even weirder than that secret level in donkey kong.
maybe it's our fault chris has such a screwed-up idea about what a relationship is.
i mean, let's be honest, we're not exactly the model of a healthy marriage.
oh, boy, is this 'cause of the time i pushed off of you after sex and bruised your boob?
we do stuff.
just last week, i let you watch me complain after eating too many hot wings.
ugh!
why?
um, she doesn't think it's healthy for you to be spending all your time with a homemade sex doll.
sex doll?
i wish.
heather hasn't even let me get to second base.
h-hang on.
what's second base?
is that touching one of the cabbages?
yeah.
but i'm such a loser, she'll never let me do that.
you are every bit as good as that bag of garbage.
you really think so?
sure, i do.
and look, if you really want to learn how to bang that thing, there's no better teacher than your old dad.

i did take care of it.
he slept with it, and now he'll slowly grow to hate it over the next 20 years.
this is all your fault.

maybe sooner than you know.
oh, peter!
they're beautiful!
you're such a sweetheart.
read the card.
"""to heather, from chris""?"
oh, i thought it might have a funny riddle on it.
oh, good, the flowers came!
we're just cocooning today because heather said she's never seen tv.
so, we're starting with season six of becker.
i'm just gonna be easing her in.
it's a katherine heigl mask for you to wear while we have sex.
she's perfect, because she's only sort of hot, so there won't be this crazy disconnect of her face on your body, which would totally take me out of it.
also, it's designed so you can wear it on your butt.
heather, i made your favorite cookies.
and now i want to hear all about your day.
oh, my god!
chris treats that pile of junk better than peter treats me!
how about a little help from kenny g?
i wonder if cleveland's gonna want his sax back.
oh, hi, chris.
where have you been?
heather and i went for a tandem bike ride.
and then had lunch at a gastropube.
nope.
sounds like fun.
what have you guys been up to?
your father got a dvd of black people fighting in the street.
it's not just in the street.
some of them are in private residences.
wow, your plans sound very sweet and romantic, chris.
and how a man should treat his woman.
oh, lois, your breath smells like eggs.
talk that way.
chris, when you go on your picnic tomorrow, c-can your father and i come with you?
let me just ask heather.
i know, but i think we better.
apparently the cancer's already in his bones.
what are you doing?
i know.
maybe he'll learn something.
are you sure about this?
it seems pretty extreme.
well, i got to try something.
peter and i used to be so close.
but now we're like apples and oranges.
people say we're different, but we're really not that different.
we've both lost children.
we both own cars, but we like to take the bus.
and we both cheat at words with friends.
oh, nice try!
i certainly do not!
and we're both gonna have a moderate time at the party tonight.
and we're not gonna count each other's drinks.
we won't have to because we won't be drinking.
wow, it sure is fun going on a picnic, isn't it, peter?
damn it!

his brain ain't right, but it's fun.
hey, chris.
i-i see you're sad.
and also sitting on the remote.
i don't know, but sometimes when life's got you down, you-you got to stand up for a second.
like-like, just for a second.
i've never felt this sad!
aw, looks like somebody could use a hug.
here we go.
oh, no, i hit input!
we may have to throw away the television.
what should i do, dad?
she seems cool.
this day has haagen-dazs written all over it.
boy, he's really upset.
i can't deal with anything until i've had my after-nap coffee.
i don't think guys should have two hands on a coffee mug ever.
what?
mmm, oh, yummy.
don't do that, either.
j-just-just don't do anything.
hey, chris.
i see you turned your hat around so you can really get in there.
oh, what do you care?
what does anybody care?
why don't you come with me?
i-i've got something to show you.
come on.
oh, my god!
i'm sorry, chris.
you-you did this?
i did.
i took your doll because it's not a natural or healthy thing for a boy your age to have.
it looks like you stabbed her.
like, 50 times.
i was kind of jealous of it, so i guess i went a little crazy.
also, her lipstick is all smeared.
i was having a lot of strange feelings!
but i just want you to know, if you ever treat a real woman the way you treat that doll, you're gonna make her very happy.
really?
absolutely.
and i know she'll make you very happy, too.
i need heather anymore.
i'm glad to hear that, chris.
seems like maybe you're growing up.
maybe.
i guess there's just one thing left to do.
what's that?
give me that knife.
i got to cut out the baby.
oh, my god!
it's made of skittles.
you want to eat the baby together on the way home?
yeah, i'd like that, chris.
and i did learn a little something from watching chris and heather.
from now on, i am gonna be treating you like garbage.
i love you, lois.
mom?
dad?
i want you to meet my new girlfriend!
this is mistress vita.
we met on craigslist.
no talking unless i say!
hi, peter.
how'd she know your name?
peter, are-are you just trying to take a knee until the end of the show?
i'm fine.
i'm fine.
for a race around the world.
i'm desmond.
see you in another life, yeah?
4... 8... 15... 16... 23... 42.
"now press ""execute."""
kate!
locke!
who the hell is that?
move and i kill him.
michael!
others!
where's my boy?
where's my boy?
hey!
come back here!
do you want him to die?
is this what you were talking about, locke?
"""all roads lead here""."
my mother stole again from me this week.
i don't even keep money in my purse anymore, i've been hiding it.
i know it may not seem like a lot of money to some of you, but it's a lot to me.
something you want to say?
francine feels 30 dollars...
francine feels a little too much, if you ask me.
you all do.
i mean, seriously...
"""so-and-so never called me back."""
"""my mother stole 30 dollars."" i never even knew who my parents were."
couple years ago, my birth mother found me.
and through her i met my real father.
great news, right?
well, he pretended to love me, just long enough to steal my kidney, because he had to have a transplant.
and then he dropped me back in the world like a piece of trash, just like he did on the day that i was born.
probably a good idea.
you know if you get kidney cancer, you've only got one.
that's funny.
i'm sorry if i ruined your meeting.
you just said everything i've always wanted to say in there.
"most of the time, i want to stand up and scream ""get over it, freaks!"""
well, why don't you?
ah, i have to keep a cork in.
once i get all hot and bothered, there's no stopping me.
guess you won't be coming back next week, huh?
no, not likely.
i'm helen, by the way.
hi, helen.
where's kate?
lower your gun or i'll blow his damned head off.
where's kate?
i'm not putting down anything!
do not move!
don't...
he's unarmed...
he just had a gun pointed at your head!
what did you do?
what did you do?
we're all gonna die.
we're all gonna die.
if you do not let me up, we are going to die.
stop moving, or, i swear to god...
that's a timer and it's counting down.
i've got to enter the code, got to push the button.
what's going to happen?
do i know you?
you got him?
bastard!
what?
nothing, jack.
hey.
what are you doing?
i... just have trouble sleeping in a strange bed.
morning.
morning.
john, i know you like to drive through my neighbourhood.
and i know that every now and then, you like to park outside my house.
now, i thought it might all stop when i moved, but here you are.
now, i'll admit, at first i thought it was funny.
now it's just annoying.
so how about you tell me what the hell it is you want.
why?
excuse me?
why?
"there is no ""why""."
you think you're the first person that ever got conned?
you needed a father figure and i needed a kidney.
and that's what happened.
get over it.
and, john, don't come back.
you're not wanted.
i don't think you need that, kate.
whatever you're looking for, maybe i can help.
can you fix a computer?
then you can't help me.
sayid can fix a computer.
get him.
there's got to be a front door here.
down the corridor to the left.
be persistent, the wheel sticks.
got ya!
now, tell me what's going on.
you wanna get to work?
tell me how you got here.
he brings me down here.
first thing he does, cos it's beeping, he types in the code, pushes the button and it stops.
"""what was all that about?"" i say."
"""just saving the world"", he says."
so i started pushing the button too.
and now here i am all alone.
the end!
don't tell me you believe this.
you don't have to take my word for it.
here...
dude, i gotta say, i didn't think we were gonna get through the night.
and i wasn't even here for that baby-stealing part.
i can assure you it was very exciting.
things are finally returning to normalness.
sayid!
aw, crap.
what do you know?
what'd they do to you?
who the hell are they?
who the hell are they?
others!
did you see walt?
how many?
could be a hundred of them out there!
i wanna try and get us outta here.
c'mon, help us out, chewie.
come on, lift me higher.
it's a girl.
wanna tell me what was going on down here before i showed up, john?
desmond.
he wanted to know a lot about us.
you seem calm for someone who believes the world's going to end in 45 minutes.
he'll fix it.
you understand that what he's saying, it's insane.
why is it insane?
the last time i saw the computer that would save the world, it didn't look like that.
is the reason you're so upset because he said he recognised you?
because that would be impossible.
not long after the experiments began, however, there was... an incident.
"""induction into the programme."
when the alarm sounds, either you or your partner must input the code.
it is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts.
do not attempt to use the computer for anything...
congratulations!
until your replacements arrive, the future of the project is in your hands.
we're gonna need to watch that again.
what's that?
i didn't get you anything.
only cost me a buck.
well, helen, i...
i don't know what to say.
there's just one condition though, john.
when you stay over, you stay over.
what do you mean?
i followed you last night.
to that house that you go to.
is it your father's house?
why would you follow me, helen?
why would you do that?
you sneak off in the middle of the night.
i just needed to know where you were going.
i care about you, john...
but what i do is my business.
it's personal.
i wasted 20 years of my life being angry.
i needed to find help.
you help me, john.
and i can help you.
you just have to promise me that you're not gonna go to that place anymore.
all right.
all right?
you're going to watch that again?
aren't you?
ok, ok!
you all right, sister?
flight 815?
you were on it, too?
you were in the back?
it broke off mid-air, how did you...
i don't know, i don't know.
the plane came apart and somebody's fricking hardside came out of the overhead and knocked me out.
i woke up underwater and... made my way to the top.
you been out here by yourself all this time?
trying to find food.
making my way, hoping to find somebody...
and then, yesterday, they found me.
who are they?
you tell me.
i'm ana lucia.
sawyer.
this is mike.
the quiet korean guy's jin.
we're about to be the best thing that ever happened to you.
how's that?
"next time shaft opens the cage, he's gonna get a surprising little ""howdy-doody""."
are you in contact with the people who made it?
do you think i'd be here if i was?
i push this button every 108 minutes.
i don't get out much.
so these replacements...
kelvin died waiting for his replacements.
so you don't get out, you don't see anyone, where's your food come from?
you really think this is happening?
"it says ""quarantine"" on the inside of the hatch to keep you down here, keep you scared."
we've been up there for over 40 days and no one's gotten sick.
you think this is the only part of it that's true?
every single day.
and for all our sakes, i hope it's not real.
but the film says this is an electromagnetic station.
and i dunno about you, brother, but every time i walk past that concrete wall out there, my fillings hurt.
right.
oh, no!
what happened?
it's over.
"what do you mean ""it's over""?"
what are you doing?
are you leaving?
desmond.
give him my best.
where are you going?
as far as i can run, brother.
what should we do?
nothing.
we do nothing.
what was supposed to happen?
please!
jack.
damn it!
what am i supposed to do?
helen, what...
hey, helen, wait.
helen!
don't!
helen!
why are you doing this?
he's not coming out of his house because he doesn't care.
you're scared.
you're scared of moving forward, with me, with us.
you're gonna have to choose.
him or me.
yes, it is.
i...
i can't.
yes, you can.
no, i can't!
i don't know how.
because you don't know what's going to happen.
none of us do.
"that's why it's called a ""leap of faith"", john."
you don't have to be alone.
jack?
john.
dude...
what is this place?
there has to be one.
follow the conduit lines.
did you find it?
"depends what you mean by ""it""."
sick prisoner?
you serious?
what, you got a better idea, sweetheart?
where'd you get that gun, anyway?
the gun, how'd you get it on the plane?
there was a federal marshal on the plane.
you just happened to have his gun?
yeah.
how come you didn't use it when they grabbed you?
guess i was too busy getting hit in the face with a club.
why are you suddenly so interested, cupcake?
come on, we gotta...
back up!
back up!
coming out.
coming out!
damn!
stop!
oh, right.
the code, yeah?
listen carefully.
if by some miracle you get that computer working, enter the code.
nothing is going to happen.
some... man takes you down there, shows you a movie, and you push a button on faith alone?
nothing is going to happen!
in about 15 minutes, you're either gonna be very right or very wrong.
you don't even know what you're running from!
i remember you.
running.
stop.
you twisted your ankle.
you're a doctor, right?
there was this girl, you were worried, you said...
you said you failed her.
right.
then, you're...
you're not married to her anymore, then.
see you in another life, yeah?
can you fix it?
this man, whoever he was, replaced the motherboard.
all i need to know is that the timer is counting down to something, and that this computer needs to be repaired.
i'm sure you'll tell me why once i've done so.
found it!
i'm working on it.
you have to...
i know what i have to do.
reconnected the processor.
replaced the transformer.
it's on!
can you remember what it is?
wait a minute.
15. 16.
23.
we don't even know what it does!
it's 42.
you're sure?
you do it, jack.
what?
you have to do it.
this argument is irrelevant.
jack.
look, you want to push the button, do it yourself.
it's never been easy!
maybe you should just do it.
it's a button.
i can't do this alone, jack.
i don't want to.
it's a leap of faith, jack.
i'll take the first shift.
but a series of recent events seem to suggest all across the globe animals have decided: no more.
and so we were hired, a team of people from different backgrounds, with different specialities:
our task: to find out what is happening with the animals, why it's happening, and how to stop it.
but we're running out of time.
hey, now.
looks like a type of alcanivorax bacteria.
♪ there was an old lady who swallowed a cat ♪
so we're at a dead end.
okay, jackson, you stay here with jamie and you find this leo butler.
you're free to roam about the cabin...
word on the street is that butler has been blackmailing reiden ever since he went underground and dispersing the money to various charities, charities all over the world that give the money to people who've been wronged by reiden.
are these internal reiden documents?
you, uh... you said my name louder than necessary as if to alert somebody in your room of my presence.
how'd you know we were here?
well, i am a trained professional.
so, first, i find you scam your way into a crime scene at a prison, and now, you've hacked into reiden global.
so, how about you tell me what you're really up to?
hey, you know, you can't just arrest him before we've had a chance to talk with him first.
even has a case number.
miss campbell, you just told me that leo butler's blackmailing a multinational corporation.
you see the linkage?
that's a better takeaway?
rabies is the only thing that would even come close to explaining this.
outlawed in the states and most developed countries.
still doesn't give us much time, does it?
my friend, we don't want any trouble.
rio has many sights popular with the tourists, but... this neighborhood is not one of them.
your name is written on almost every other page of his bible.
they've got people everywhere!
there's a brand new library there 'cause of you.
no, i'm good.
someday, i would like to meet this person who made you become this thing you are today.
look, a lot of guys would not have given that money to charity.
ever wonder why reiden is so much more successful than all of their competitors?
a vector is a dna molecule used to manipulate cellular material on a genetic level.
among other things, the vector is extremely rare.
outside of reiden, you are the only other people who know it exists.
only a select few inside reiden even know where it comes from.
by the time they realized the potential side effects, it was too late.
no one is gonna hurt you.
just get us the mother cell and all of this will be over.
one of you guys punched him in the face, and the other one's a cop.
she hasn't seen him since she was two years old.
plan b is we make it work.
i swear to god, i am gonna kill that man before this is over.
the plane in japan... perhaps the bats were attracted to its radio waves.
and what about the solar panels in the antarctic?
our ability to reason  and our technology.
all right, hold on.
we don't have a warrant, so none of this can be used in court.
we go far out into the forest and we hook up something with an electromagnetic signal, and we boost it somehow so the bats can't miss it.
once there, they'll be too far away to see any other electromagnetic source.
if we don't, the government will drop poison from the sky, and as you yourself pointed out, that poison will affect every living thing in rio.
i'm gonna sell some of this stuff to help pay for henry's doctor bills.
wow.
i don't use my gps.
you are the only man who has ever escaped my cold embrace.
but i am never far away.
yes.
i'm always with you.
by the wreck of an old cargo ship.
word on the street is the octopus might be in on it.
i'd call it in  but who knows how far his tentacles spread?
who we can trust?
i'm on my way.
my city.
she's always there for me.
every lonely night, she's there for me.
she's not some tarted-up fraud all dressed up like a piece of jailbait.
she's an old city old and proud of her every pock and crack and wrinkle.
she's my sweetheart, my plaything.
she doesn't hide what she is, what she's made of:
sweat, muscle and blood of generations.
she sleeps.
after midnight and until dawn, only shadows move in the silence.
there she is!
my city screams.
she needs me.
she is my love.
she is my life.
here, let's get you to your feet.
police!
over here, macready.
this is a good man, you can trust him.
what are you?
that's the spirit.
god bless him.
she provides for me, my city does.
she gives me everything i need.
move it over, liebowitz.
sussman called.
sussman wants this one kept under the radar for now.
you hear that, boss?
every goddamn night.
they say only sailors and cops can hear her.
well, i'm not a sailor.
and i'm not a cop.
get an ambulance.
call dolan.
not commissioner dolan.
spirit says he's still breathing.
hurts like a son of a bitch.
that broad.
a beautiful broad.
she was beautiful.
you look for more footprints, liebowitz.
she was beautiful.
if this is the wrong box, i'll kill you myself.
you know what he can do.
shut up and bleed.
you look for more footprints, liebowitz.
she was beautiful.
and she wasn't looking for a fight, either.
easy, now.
just breathe through your nose if you can.
getting dizzy.
steady.
steady.
heads up!
take it home, boys.
when me and the spirit get together, we like to party all night.
there is nothing i like better than kicking your ass all night long.
except maybe eggs.
where's the truck?
how do we find our way home without her?
silken floss is the most beautiful woman ever.
she was supposed to be here.
how do we find our way home without her?
where's the truck?
i found the truck!
silken floss is the most beautiful woman ever.
load up the box and pile in, specimens.
you've done your petri dishes proud.
no need to wait for the boss if that's the spirit back there.
the octopus always finds his nemesis so distracting.
well, then, they'll be at it all night.
oh, god.
silken floss is the most beautiful-
you're giving me a headache, octopus.
it's gonna get worse before it gets better, pretty boy.
you're right about that.
come on!
toilets are always funny.
i was watching.
that's enough.
let's get out of here.
pretty boy.
tough boy.
i'll be seeing you again  real soon.
i'm gonna be the death of you, octopus.
death?
i'm gonna kill you all kinds of dead.
i had you beat like eggs.
heck you did.
anybody watching could've seen i had you right where i wanted you.
in your dreams.
you're an accident.
you never should've happened.
your mind ain't right, octopus.
you're talking crazy talk.
we're the only two like us, pretty boy.
well, you sure can take a lot of punishment, sweetheart.
just like me.
you ever wonder why?
never even crossed my mind.
well, i'll be learning you!
i'll be learning you real soon.
i'll be learning you.
oh, well, look who's here.
boss, we better get out of here.
such pain.
such suffering.
sleep.
come on, come on, come on.
hey, baby.
you're a mess.
three bullets across the deltoid.
they went straight through me.
hardly took any meat.
major contusions on any visible skin.
evidence of a profusely bleeding cranial wound.
no, that's nothing.
that's just a bump.
yeah, you're a mess, all right.
really, i'm okay.
no, this is serious.
for god's sake, you can't keep taking these chances.
do you know where you are?
what year is it?
this year.
do you know who you are?
the spirit.
and it really hurts when that happens, but i always get better.
why do you say that?
because he told me he knows something.
oh, golly, will you look at that.
that was close, buddy.
i was looking all over for you.
that's better.
that's better.
that tears it.
you're delusional.
tuska, over here!
ellen!
i can hear fluid in his chest.
it's faint, but i swear it's there.
he's got blood in both his lungs.
stabilize him, get him on pegasus.
if you can't move any faster, i'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
i'm just feeling dizzy from all the action, i guess.
you're doing this town no good with your hot-dogging.
we're flat on our asses  happy to clean up after your dog-and-pony show.
you know the score.
bring me up to speed.
he thinks i don't run a tight ship?
suspected a leak in your department.
didn't want the octopus getting away.
come on, it was a judgment call.
i got one officer an inch from dying, another, his head yanked off  because you went off half-cocked after the octopus.
you're damn right i'm going after the octopus!
you been to dropsie avenue and c?
have you seen those girls?
some just learning how to ride a bike, there they are, selling their souls  slaves to the octopus and his poison.
maybe you and your force could use a little obsession, dolan.
maybe you and your force could work a little harder.
maybe if you and your force could find the octopus...
solo?
that wasn't our deal, hotshot.
well, then maybe we don't have a deal anymore, commissioner.
why, you...
you're living at the edge of a cliff, son.
and all you got is a tired old man trying to hold you back.
look, we're both tired.
yeah.
just give me 10 minutes.
hell, i don't know why i even bother to try and talk to you anymore.
just give me 10 minutes.
just to clear my head.
what's 10 minutes in a man's life anyway?
spirit?
sir.
that cliff i was talking about?
there's no bottom.
don't jump.
"""what are you?"" that's what the woman asked me."
it's a good question.
i wish i had an answer for her.
am i a crazy man?
or am i a man at all?
some nights, like this one, when the wind bites deep, bone deep and even my city seems to leave me behind, i wonder:
am i some sort of ghost?
some sort of flying dutchman?
if the wind picked up hard enough would i just blow away?
i'm not a cop.
not anymore.
not even a dead man.
not even a spirit.
you still here?
you're a trigger, pathos.
just look at you.
quick draw mcgraw himself.
i'll be great.
i don't have any bones sticking out.
a couple of splints, i'll be good to go.
yeah, just hop right over to st. alice's, get fixed up all nice and new.
i'll have to explain why a criminal mastermind like myself  doesn't provide his employees with medical insurance.
that'd be egg on my face, pathos.
you know i don't like egg on my face.
using your brain?
that, you weren't built for.
just tell me where the emergency room is.
i'll tell them i'm one of the homelesses.
they don't make them pay.
no egg on my face!
not a glob!
not a glob.
any other case, little buddy.
any other job.
if it were anyone but her.
sand.
sand saref.
where's your bike?
you scrape your knee, or are you scared for a race?
no, i got sick of that stupid bike.
you got sick of losing races to me is more like it.
where'd you put it?
i pawned it over at fellman's.
i got a few bucks for it.
look there.
i bet those are real diamonds.
you see how they catch the light, denny?
only real ones do that.
what's with you?
nothing much.
he's not drinking again, is he?
no, no, he's not drinking.
what's got you needing money, then?
just something that i saw over at the window at kurtzman's.
is it a badge, like my dad's?
good, you ain't hardly earned a badge.
well, it was something that i thought that, you know  you might like, seeing as how you like shiny things and all.
if you don't like it, old man kurtzman said he'd take it back.
do you like it?
so you want me to be your girl?
you know, if it's all the same to you.
well, i suppose i can wear it now and then.
yeah, we had us a time, all right.
the way only city kids could.
i love it!
it says here heracles himself fought with the argonauts.
imagine jason and heracles back-to-back.
jason gleaming in his golden fleece.
yeah.
then everything went right straight to hell.
my uncle pete was a has-been fighter.
sand's dad, a beat cop who was always looking out for dumb old pete.
my uncle pete did the only thing his punch-battered brain could tell him to do.
sand got there a few minutes before me.
come on.
i tried to be strong for both of us.
come on.
i can't remember what.
and then that jerk reporter latched onto us.
sol, i can't miss this.
so, kids, just how does this make you feel?
i'll give you something.
i'll give you three words.
i hate cops.
just leave us alone, will you?
i know you're heartbroke, sand.
so am i, but you didn't mean what you said.
leave me alone, stay away.
so, sure, we grow up and we have kids in this sinkhole?
you're just not talking straight.
and you become a cop just like you always wanted to.
yeah, maybe i do.
and then some punched-out drunk of an old boxer shoots you dead?
do you think i want that?
it wasn't pete!
and where are you going to find all that, sand?
i'm not gonna find it here.
not in this toilet of a town.
i am too good for you, and i am too good for this dump.
i'm gonna go all over the world, become rich  and no one is ever gonna know that i came from this hole!
i don't care about you neither.
i never even wanna see you again!
i hate you, sand.
i never saw her again.
word is she took off for europe.
i never knew if she was alive or dead.
until now.
there's only one way this locket ended up in poor sussman's hand.
if she's working with the octopus, then my feelings don't mean a damn.
i must find sand saref  and bring her in.
my beautiful sand saref.
are you missing something, my love?
nothing important.
just something i lost a long time ago.
mark this moment, all of you.
a new age begins.
an age of great deeds.
an age of great power.
yes.
all mine.
the blood of heracles is mine.
i am sorely disappointed.
which one of you brought me this?
i guess that'd be me.
i'm supposed to have a vase full of blood.
must've been in the other box.
what other box, you fart?
sand saref.
i thought i scared her off with time to spare.
what's she doing in central city, anyway?
it didn't occur to you doorstops to mention that there was a second box?
nope, but it looked just like this one.
seppuku across the stomach, left to right.
that tickles.
with the sword, toe cheese.
so sand saref has the blood.
you know, you could've offed her and brought back both boxes.
that would've simplified things considerably.
oh, i'm supposed to do everything around here?
now, that'll wake you up.
you have to do something about sand saref.
don't worry about sand saref.
that lady's got a thing for the bling.
she was after that other box and whatever it is that's inside of it.
it's kind of creepy the way it glows like that.
so the situation's hardly a debacle.
sand saref has the blood of heracles, yes.
but we have what she wants.
get me that blood.
spill one drop and i'll turn you all into hamburger.
he's like a piece of gum stuck to the bottom of your shoe that won't let go.
am i doing this right?
yeah, looks good.
i was just wondering, because it really smarts.
i hate stepping on gum, even in winter.
makes you step funny.
we're gonna kill the spirit, and we're gonna kill him now.
he doesn't publish his address.
we're not going to look for him.
you have a plan.
i left the man a clue that will lead him right to us.
right soon, i promise.
what's the hurries, anyway?
if the spirit drinks the blood  if he so much as realizes what it could do to him  what it could turn him into, then we're finished.
and because i said so.
i am a man of my word, ms. saref.
take the promises you made to your lovely new wife.
"""forsaking all others,"" and all that."
let's not get personal, shall we?
oh, we shall.
i commissioned you to find a certain treasure for me, mr. donenfeld.
it was to mark the climax of my career.
its crown jewel.
the lost treasure of the argonauts.
and it was even worth me coming back to this horrid city  just to touch it.
to have it be mine.
the shiny thing to end all shiny things.
and i paid you a fortune for it.
and it would've been worth every nickel, but you screwed me.
so now we're gonna take every last one of those nickels  and transfer them into another bunch of accounts.
what on earth are you talking about?
you're gonna be quite the philanthropist.
i'm going to need your password, sweetheart.
it's robin.
or like the kid sidekick.
you know, the one with the cute little tights and the tight little derriere.
it's going through.
imagine my surprise  when i show up at the drop point and ran smack into the octopus.
i mean, what are the odds of that?
unless you sold the argo's treasure twice  making a perfect ass of yourself.
a perfect ass.
well, he didn't give me any choice.
take a good look at those pictures.
they'll reach your family and every news service on the planet  unless you render them irrelevant.
at least die bravely  rodent.
hold all calls.
what can i say?
last night you were 20 minutes from the morgue, and now look at you.
just look at you.
i'd recommend three days' bed rest, but why waste my breath?
you take the night off.
yeah, i'm sure mrs. mahoney's heart transplant can wait.
wwe might as well just hold off and see if old spankowitz's liver explodes.
maybe go see a show.
what about you, big man?
things stay quiet, i'd be up for anything.
anything.
so long as things stay quiet?
so long as things stay quiet.
like every crook in central city goes on sabbatical?
or maybe if i break the rules.
i feel like breaking all kinds of rules.
oh, fast hands.
very, very quiet.
something tells me it might be better that way.
you're in love with every woman you meet, mr. spirit.
ellen, it's only you.
but we don't even know your real name.
i'll tell you my name.
someday i'd love to do your autopsy.
i'd make a fortune.
love you too, daddy.
it's an honor to meet you, mr. spirit.
rookie, fresh from baltimore.
good to have you aboard, morgenstern.
come on, we haven't got the whole day.
central city's own masked manhunter.
you're worshipped by the kids.
anything you'd care to share with them?
play it straight, youngsters.
don't be too tough on your parents.
don't forget to remind them to take their vitamins.
you know, we hang on your every word.
well, i don't think i could say anything other than thanks  for being such amazing, lovely creatures.
jesus!
been nice to my daughter.
i don't know why i bother talking with you.
because we fight crime, and right now we got our hands full.
again with the octopus.
he's up to something big and it's got to do with me.
he said some weird stuff about him and me.
i gotta find out what he's talking about.
can we forget about the octopus for one minute?
just one minute?
now  we got a hot case and a murder suspect hauling her butt to the airport.
disappeared following her father's murder-
told some snoop reporter that she hated cops.
eight marriages later, runs every jewelry heist this side of bulgari.
you never heard of her, right?
she never came home.
you on drugs or something?
come on.
she's overseen hundreds of jewelry robberies  and in not one case was a police officer so much as wounded.
now, what are the odds of that, huh?
electra complex.
it's like an oedipal complex except it's for girls.
she's just angry she lost her daddy.
electra complex, plain and simple.
there's no chance in hell you haven't noticed morgenstern's new flak jacket.
even if you are on drugs.
i'm not on drugs.
state of the art, these jackets.
we had us a shipment of these babies  but we couldn't pay for them until today  when we got a very generous private donation to the force.
a lot of money.
an online donation.
anonymous.
yeah, sure, anonymous.
took our brain boys all of an hour to track it right back here.
to the offices of an expert in ancient artifacts.
yeah, who turned said artifacts into a fortune.
you might say he was a purveyor of stolen property  or, as we put it in the vernacular, a fence.
a world-class fence by the name of donenfeld.
but quelle surprise, old donenfeld, he ain't looking so good.
and my good buddy seth here  he says the old man had a visitor  just about the same time he got the hard goodbye.
what did you say her name was again there?
sand saref.
she didn't have an appointment.
some moniker, huh?
and my good buddy seth here couldn't be bothered to even call it in.
my hands were tied, officer.
mr. donenfeld had a standing order.
i was never to come into his office unless he called me in.
never, ever, ever.
morgenstern, get his number.
it's not possible.
so you do know her.
your whole theory, it doesn't make any sense.
hey, it fits together like goddamn macrame once you factor in her....
hang a murder rap on that woman over some piece of psychobabble?
her name is sand saref and you know her and you're covering for her.
i never heard of any sand saref.
you're lying!
let go of my arm before i break yours.
you did a neat little job up there, sand.
you shouldn't have signed it.
officer morgenstern, you wanna help, find me a lead to the octopus.
and the aces have it.
this i keep as a souvenir.
the rest goes to the man who can get a message to the octopus.
i thought i was closing in, putting it all together.
that three years on, here in my second life i had a pretty good idea of what i had to do.
it all got down to me and the octopus.
i was finally gonna scrub the city clean of him once and for all.
then you come along like a sack of rocks to my face.
all night, i've been rolling it around in my skull.
there's gotta be more to this, some explanation.
not murder, not you.
can't believe that about you.
you were tough, sand, on the outside, but inside, you were warm.
all woman.
one thing i'd bet my bottom dollar on:
you wouldn't be caught dead hiding out in a fleabag like any ordinary criminal would.
no, your taste was always first-class.
that's just plain damn weird.
sir, you promised the new hyper-addictive synapse accelerant  would be ready by last week.
don't you think that's plain damn weird?
also, our profits are down 20 percent.
i was beginning to think it was just me.
i was trying to make us a smart one  and this thing just sort of popped out.
twenty percent across the board.
reduce the price on the old stuff, we'll make it up in units.
word has hit the streets about the side effects.
no one likes having their teeth turned into graham crackers.
how can i get anything done with all this time on my hands?
besides, when my buddies here find sand saref  i won't need profits, i'll have the blood.
then if i want something, i'll just take it.
that's what gods do.
he is really damn little.
i mean  it's really little.
yeah, we can't find her.
i'm depressed.
i wish the spirit would come so i could get me some real killing done.
i told you already, that's going to be complex.
spirit thinks he can't stay hurt.
that stuff i put in him and me is unstable.
might not last.
the blood will take care of that.
meanwhile, i'm getting el espirito dead while i still can.
to that end  i got us another opinion.
someone to seal the deal.
the black-eyed venus is in suite 1510.
long time no see, sand.
your wish is my command.
put a robe on or something but no tricks.
yes, sir, mr. spirit, sir.
oh, watch out for my husband, you'll trip.
it's all the fault of this goddamned vase.
he tasted the stuff and, well, see for yourself.
it's stolen.
oh, yeah.
you are a common criminal.
if you're gonna lock me up  do it over something i am actually guilty of, stupid.
i could burn a priest's ears confessing the half of it.
but this time, my hands are clean, crime fighter.
so run on home, wait for the forensics report.
i haven't shot anybody in days.
there probably isn't a law on the books that you wouldn't break.
do i look like a good girl?
what's that got to do with anything?
sand, the octopus, that fence and you?
now, after all of these....
there's that crazy talk from the octopus about him and-
listen, mister  i don't care.
i don't even care about people that i like and i don't know you.
i don't see what use i could possibly be to you.
i have nothing to offer this rotten little town of yours.
as a matter of fact, i despise it.
only one thing between that river and that ocean that i came here for.
it was supposed to be worth something more than jewels.
something a little girl's dreams are made of.
i knew a little girl like that once.
she was a very sweet girl but the world broke her heart.
you were looking for a hero and his armor.
the only man who would know that is dead.
the golden fleece.
you'll believe a man can't fly.
get me the hell out of here.
one of the octopus' henchmen, we found him dead near the flats.
industrial salt, it was caked all over his shoes.
yeah, well, sand, that went great, didn't it?
reunions between old sweethearts will have to wait.
plenty of bad guys too.
all the enemy has is guns and knives.
i have an entire city as my weapon.
iron-jawed fire escapes.
she is my mother, my city is.
what a fine detective.
you followed the breadcrumbs right to us.
you're not doing anybody good by falling asleep on the job.
so why don't you go home, get yourself some proper rest?
sussman's still in critical, they're trying to save his spine.
he's a goddamn menace and my own daughter's in love with him.
so you can lose your youth stapling his parts back?
i know exactly what i'm doing.
i'm the only one who knows his body.
plenty of dames who know all about his body, from what i hear.
plenty of broads he's stretched across a gurney or what have you  knowing just what to say.
honey, i don't know how to talk about this stuff.
why do you think i spend my nights knocking around that old house alone?
you're married to your job.
you were so much happier in the old days with denny.
and i'll never forget him but we keep going.
yeah  and i lost my little prom queen, huh?
i just hope that son of a bitch knows how lucky he is.
let me hold you.
dental and nazi.
i've known some pretty strange women in my time, some darn strange women.
but this one  if she is who i think she is, she's got the final word on strange.
plaster of paris.
it's just about all we think about, isn't it?
we eat  so we won't die.
we mate so that our seed will live on.
create art and build skyscrapers  so that our names will be remembered for centuries.
mr. long, my good friend, how are you?
oh, yes, i know her.
well, you should've known better than to play cards with her.
let's say  after dinner.
we live our short  frantic, fearful lives, twisting this way and that.
making up gods, afterlives, all to keep our eyes off  that immovable, impassable, diamond-hard retaining wall  that is death, realizing it will splatter our brains  like eggs.
because i'm getting old just listening to you.
you just don't get it.
we're two of a kind, you and me.
you keep teasing about how we're two of a kind.
when they wheeled you in, you were stone-cold dead.
not a breath of life in you.
dead as star trek.
and i was your coroner.
but i was, oh, so much, much more than that.
all you have to do is water it down, spruce it up and achtung.
immortality.
all five sweet syllables of it.
there had to be a better way to keep someone alive  other than cutting them open like some free-range chicken.
free-range chickens with big, brown, ugly-ass eggs.
they piss me off.
every time i think about those big, brown eggs, they piss me off.
they're just another way to stall death.
yeah, you're a real smart fella.
and i've got a freezer full of stray beagles to prove it.
oh, what that serum did to those poor dogs  was just plain wrong.
but when i got it right, well, i had to try it out.
i needed a human.
and there i was.
and there you was.
i gave you a modest injection and i waited.
your second life began that very night.
do you remember?
oh, yeah, i remember.
somewhere in the midst of all that praying, whimpering and sniveling you must have found something sharp.
you know, i always wanted to ask:
where did you go when you got out?
i took a walk.
i had myself a think.
i visited an old friend.
i don't know what happened, but i still move, i still breathe.
it's impossible, but i'm still alive.
all my life, all i wanted to be was a good cop.
the bad guys are winning.
i think i've got something more to fight back with now.
i'm something else now.
i can go places, i can do things they won't let cops do.
i have to stay dead in everybody's eyes.
even ellen's.
but i could be your spy.
i could work with your men.
behind them, in the shadows.
its spirit.
exit hero cop, enter the spirit.
tough as nails.
eureka!
so i shot myself up, and we became brothers under the skin.
so, what the hell are we, octopus?
you're works in progress.
and once he has the vase and its contents  its mystic contents, lost over millennia  he'll drink of it and he'll become immortal.
don't tease.
seeing as how i'm gonna die anyway, clue me in.
what's in the vase?
better.
the dna...
yeah, because, you know, humans and gods, they don't mix very well.
the only route to take is to find the connection between man and god  the child of an immortal and a human.
see, zeus couldn't keep it in his pants, so he made bags and bags of heroes.
now, the greatest of them all was heracles.
and we found his ass.
well, his blood anyway.
he left some blood around.
and we know where it is.
so that's the missing link between science and magic.
now, once heracles' blood mixes with octopus' formula....
i become a god.
and you'll be just one more sad little byproduct.
one of his many, many, many failures.
besides, look at all the lovely buddies i've made along the way.
yeah, the boss says we was easy to make.
but your failures were several.
and unpleasant.
yeah, you know, you get so much as one little drop  the wrong temperature, and everything just-
let me show you.
it's kind of sad  but it's really kind of cool too.
this is muffin.
she's my favorite.
we have to have people over more often.
i like this.
the cat.
she is all the reason i need.
i will kill you.
you're the only one the blood won't kill.
one sip and you could be rendered as immortal as he.
the octopus can be the only one.
there can be no competition once he's world ruler.
yes, then everyone will have to do what i say.
they will all have to do what i say because i will be the ruler of the world.
then everything will start to make sense.
yes, everything will make sense.
everything will start to make sense.
let's get back to business.
yes, back to business.
back to killing your ass.
now, here's where things become a little tricky.
it's all about integration.
now, in your current state, you heal very quickly.
your wounds mend in moments.
the only solution, it turns out, is to affect your systemic disintegration.
in short  to render you into so many different parts spread so far  that reintegration would be impossible.
and being the man that i am  i like to start from the bottom and work my way up.
floss, bring me those bags.
i'm going to mail your ass all over the country.
plaster  bring me his toes.
plaster.
enough of this frog talk.
i don't understand it.
paris  give me his toes.
that's an order.
i hate you.
this is for me.
and this one's for muffin.
that all you got?
who is this sand?
let's go.
the spirit.
plaster.
and this is for sand.
i am plaster of paris.
the toast of montmartre.
i will stick to my man.
till death do us part.
you're close now.
very, very close.
you can't fight me.
hey, man, i know the feeling.
you should meet my wife.
just put one foot in front of the other.
here we go again.
i'm dead again.
the fight's gone out of me.
i'm ready for you, lorelei.
come.
come.
it is time.
come.
no more pain.
no more suffering.
give up the last of it, denny.
give up the ghost.
give up the spirit.
yes, my darling.
it is done.
it is done.
it is done.
what's it they say about when you die about your whole life flashing before your eyes?
forget all that.
all i see are women.
my sweet ellen, always there to put my ragged pieces back together.
and sand.
that poor lost soul.
beautiful, beautiful sand.
it's so funny my last thought would be of sand.
no.
lorelei, you're not for me just yet.
no, not again.
i will always be with you, denny colt.
you won't escape me forever.
they need me.
sand  at the projects.
octopus.
pieces.
pieces of sand.
pieces.
pieces of octopus.
you son of a bitch, octopus.
you're mine.
always with the octopus.
this time, you better know your place.
you're supposed to be my spy, not some vigilante.
if you go all cowboy on me again, i am gonna blast you in half myself.
you got that?
i got an idea.
hey, you keep that thing pointed at the octopus.
when i give you the word, you blow his head off.
then it's on with our wedding night, huh, baby?
who the hell are you?
we show up here, we look fabulous doing it  we swap things, then we leave.
you're looking to get yourself killed.
would you lighten up?
no sign of the octopus.
hell of a waste of time if he didn't show up.
whenever he does, sir, we are locked and loaded.
that cannon could take out the moon, rookie.
sir, i'm an excellent shot.
sweetie, he's just using you.
i run a very lucrative operation and i'm great eye candy.
i walk away, i have my ph. d. all paid for.
tell lug nuts over there to give me the box.
and you, you start that walking.
as far away from that animal as you possibly can.
i just think you're taking this way too seriously, that's all.
give them the vase.
boss said i start shooting now.
get in the truck.
floss  fetch me that vase, please.
give me the blood of heracles, now.
"i always thought it was ""hercules. """
you.
sand, you found your armor.
use it.
octopus  you were right.
we're mistakes.
we never should have happened.
he doesn't want any cops getting killed.
you're not making this easy.
it ends tonight.
i'm the octopus.
there's shot to hell.
and shot to hell.
and there's just plain ridiculous.
now.
you idiot, octopus.
all we needed was to flush you and your gunsels out.
commissioner dolan, your daughter's here.
baby, you don't wanna be here.
you're joking, right, daddy?
you'll be in his way, he doesn't want you here.
you don't know a damn thing.
runny eggs.
finally.
yeah!
nice investment, sand.
i guess it's time to finally drop your armor, sand.
you lost something.
old man kurtzman said he'd take it back.
well  maybe i'll wear it now and then.
but it doesn't mean i'm your girl.
goodbye, spirit.
yeah, well, you had something to do with it.
yeah, she looks old.
me and every other woman you meet.
you are amazing.
bastard.
we start from scratch.
who knows what i'll do?
endlessly noisy.
endlessly alive.
she's all i really have.
my only hope.
my only constant.
the secrets of the octopus died with him.
i don't know what i am or how long i got.
heck, maybe i'll live forever.
that's nothing any man ought to want.
denny colt is dead.
i'm something else now and i can never give my heart to anyone but her.
she will always be mine and i will always be hers.
she owns me, body and soul.
she is the love of my life.
she is my city.
who the hell are these guys?
i hate to break it to them, but i don't plan on spending the rest of my life in a uranium mine.
they're still behind us.
what the hell?
another one!
twelve o'clock!
we're losing engine power.
tyr, rev, assess the damage.
the starboard thrusters have gone critical!
rev, vent the tank now!
it's either that, or turn into a fireworks display.
do it!
venting!
thank the stars for momentum.
they're still on us.
if we keep this up, they're bound to find the andromeda.
objects in motion tend to stay in motion.
any sign of pursuit?
do we run, or do we land?
venting o2 tanks for deceleration.
we're going too fast!
i can't believe it's taken us three weeks to clean up all these bodies.
harper, we could use a little help, here.
harper, stop it!
harper, i need you to concentrate on your work.
oh, you just want me to sweep 'em under the rug and forget about it, is that it?
forget that i was swarmed by dozens of magog and my guts infested with parasites?
i think what she's trying to say is, you know, the medication we gave you has put the larva in a dormant state, so...
i can when i need to.
compartmentalization?
more like schizophrenia.
guess we'll be a little late getting back with those parts.
snow.
blood.
i'll be fine.
what about the others?
reverend behemial!
you dead?
tyr anasazi of the kodiak pride.
clearly i am not in heaven.
the nietzscheans?
i always thought slavers were lazy.
and even if it did work, it would only help the nietzscheans to find us.
well, on the bright side, we are covered in highly reflective, heat-dampening snow.
it makes us harder to find.
on the not-so-bright side, we have no fuel, no heat, and minimal gfg.
all right, then let's mobilize.
tyr, rev, fix the engines.
cannibalize parts if you have to.
beka, you and i will take...
i'll be fine.
yeah, ok, tough guy.
hand me a laser torch.
do magog get concussions?
your health affects my health.
i need to know your condition.
i have been fasting a ritual purification for those i so viciously killed.
since we left the world-ship.
i had intended on breaking my fast when we returned to the andromeda, but apparently it is the divine's will that that is not to happen.
i don't suppose you could eat the emergency rations?
on the andromeda, i keep a supply of live salmon in the hydroponics garden.
but we're not on board the andromeda.
you honestly don't expect him to starve himself to death, do you?
he's a magog.
tyr, this is rev we're talking about.
you didn't look into his eyes.
he was just like all the others feral.
then our first order of business is to find food for him.
there are no live prey animals on this planet so far as we know.
which means the only viable food source for him right now is us.
we should lock him up.
rev bem has more self-control than anyone i've ever met.
besides, we're gonna need all hands to get out of here.
what's the status on the engines?
and where there's settlements, there's fuel.
i'll go outside and see if i can spot any heat signatures on the horizon.
i'm the best suited for hostile environments.
thanks, but no thanks.
having a nietzschean along may cause problems with any potential allies.
captain hunt!
in the past few months, you've been placing yourself in a number of very risky situations.
it's not a healthy trend.
i didn't know that you cared.
maintain radio silence.
we don't want to give away our position.
i expect the acting weapons officer to help beka and rev fix the ship.
and protect them if necessary.
from whatever.
i thought you were helping rev.
i thought you told me he could help himself.
and so can i.
you may dislike my concerns about your rev bem, but they're valid, nonetheless.
and if you've misplaced your trust, your life is forfeit as well as mine.
you wanna talk about misplaced trust?
who were those nietzscheans?
slavers are nine-to-five bad guys.
when the going gets tough, they find easier marks.
they wouldn't care enough to chase us through slipstream.
then who are they?
why don't you tell me?
when we first saw them, after topeka drift, they were flying past us going the other way.
so, what did you do that time you took off in my ship for three weeks?
as i recall, when we found you, you were being hunted by the entire drago-kasov empire.
nietzscheans!
great!
would you please excuse me?
i seem to be in need of some private contemplation.
dylan's been gone too long.
he's in trouble.
i don't doubt it.
what would you like me to do?
he insisted on going out there alone.
that's a good shot.
hungry.
i hate planets.
water turns into snow and ice, which i also hate...
like i hate pretty much every kind of weather.
so, now you believe in the divine?
let's just say that sitting on a crashed starship, freezing to death i'm open to the idea.
i guess what i'm trying to say, rev, is that i trust you.
then i shall fervently pray that i do not betray that trust.
this way!
follow the tree!
they're low on ammunition.
tyr anasazi!
anything you want to tell me?
we'll save that conversation for later.
i thought you were supposed to be working in the engine room.
it was kind of you and trance to exempt me from clean-up.
harper, i need you in there.
i think there might be a leak in one of the ap transfer lines.
oh, a ruptured transfer line.
yes, harper.
i need you to find the leak before the mag bottles start to overload.
it stinks like magog and i'm feeling a little magog-ophobic, ok?
i just i can't.
we lost them about a kilometer away.
if they don't follow your tree markings back here.
well, i ran out of bread crumbs.
overshot by over a hundred meters.
at least they're bad shots.
it may not matter.
oh, i, uh, i love hugs.
it's the kissing that freaks me out.
i realize we are all fallen angels, but twice in one day?
tyr, status.
this entire area is riddled with tunnels.
must be an old mining planet.
how far down are we?
seventy-three meters below the surface.
let's spread out and inspect the damage.
considerable damage in the aft section.
i have a suggestion.
assuming the nietzscheans are still looking for us...
beka?
no one's blowing up my ship.
tyr?
i don't care if the maru is buried beneath a thousand kilometers of rubble, or roasting in the heart of a sun, or up on blocks in the imperial museum of tarn vedra.
no one's blowing up my ship.
how would you propose to get us home?
this *is* my home.
sorry, that was a bit much.
i'd be upset if someone suggested blowing up the andromeda.
maybe there's an alternative.
this is squorm refuse.
they process the ore internally and excrete it as refined metal.
not to mention that they're huge and extremely bad-tempered.
how huge?
i got him.
how huge?
you saw the diameter of the tunnels?
and they only eat ore?
as long as there's plenty of it.
if not, and they bump into, say, the, uh...
then we become food for the squorms.
yeah.
beka, without food, a magog's body my body will ravage itself.
i will begin to digest my own intestines, muscle, bone, nerve ending.
i fear the process has already begun.
then, uh, we'll just have to get you something to eat.
how does nietzschean au jus sound?
beka, do not even joke!
i was weak.
it completed my creation.
you're not satisfied, are ya?
that's not what you're looking for.
grief.
oh, damn!
you drank all my neuverin weisbrau.
what are you doing?
trance has worked medical miracles before...
i got an irrevocable appointment with a painful, horrible, violent death, and no one can fix me, rommie.
no one can fix me.
it sure would be nice to find some friendly locals.
the only people on this rock are nietzscheans.
hey, maybe we could feed them to rev.
uh already suggested that.
killing them first?
the first one to find a way to the surface calls the others.
what about rev?
he'll stay and preserve his energy and pray hopefully for all of us.
beka.
coming.
they must've used this to launch the refined metal into orbit.
is it functional?
there's probably too much rock between us and him.
he might've been forced to smile.
so, we hook this thing up to the maru's auxiliary power unit, use our gfg to lower our mass to nothing, and, uh...crap.
how do we get the maru up here?
float it up the tunnel to the mouth of the accelerator.
power it up and shoot the maru straight into space.
when you have lemons, you make lemonade.
nice.
squorms.
they're homing in on the magnetic field of our weapons.
turn them off.
it's not the guns.
the maru!
squorms, from every direction, closing in.
weapons locker.
figures.
tyr took them while i was in the engine room meditating.
and you didn't stop him?
kiama?
you used your last credit on enga's redoubt.
i was shot down by dragons.
you know, that's funny.
in fact, if i remember correctly, you were dashing off in the maru while we got shelled by an entire dragon security division.
i couldn't risk them recapturing our prize.
you were always gonna keep 'em for yourself!
unfortunately, one of them is slowly starving to death, and the other one's out betraying us.
we don't know that.
and if he's betraying us?
then i'll be the first to know.
those are two fully charged gauss guns.
consider that compensation.
oh, please.
knowing what you want, sticking with it?
i'm offering you a chance to shape the fate of the nietzschean people.
kiama, kiama, kiama, kiama.
would you like to know the real reason i left you behind on enga's redoubt?
because you're just so uncompromisingly inferior!
reactor overload.
power reactor one going critical.
unable to vent due to damage in the ap line.
harper, if you don't get in there and fix that line, we'll blow up!
you're going to die!
what about inside of me?
reactor critical in seventy seconds.
and if you're gone, who's going to fix me?
sixteen seconds.
rev.
rev?
beka, please.
i felt like my world was crashing in on me.
i remember.
how dare i presume to know what the divine had in store for me?
so now, rev, what about you?
beka, i was not created by your divine.
i was created by the spirit of the abyss as an instrument of fear and destruction.
that is my purpose.
how could my death not be moral?
beka, please, forgive me.
rev.
well, i'm good to go.
you still owe me that conversation.
let's go.
well, it's about time.
hi!
hi.
found tyr.
we can leave now.
moving us to the launcher.
we're blocked.
with gfg on, we don't have enough mass to ram them.
kiama!
and here comes its mother.
bon appetit.
we're at the launcher.
we're escaping the atmosphere.
and they want to blow you up.
bring us home, beka.
it was a cake-walk up here.
i'll keep you in my prayers.
i really mean that.
you wanted to see me?
the travelers-aid database we downloaded on glitterdust.
i found this.
and, hey, they want you alive.
i have saved your ship, your crew (such as it is), and your mission on many an occasion.
and while i may have earned the wrath of the drago-kasov pride, they wanted to kill you long before they ever heard of me.
oh, then i guess that makes it all right.
if you would like me to leave, sir you have but to ask.
to be perfectly honest?
enlighten me.
especially an ambitious man with ulterior motives who wants to live long enough to see them through.
whether i like it or not, i need you sir.
and i shall be so bold as to say you need me, as well.
your move.
all right, you have been listening to the next set up.
you know, when i said they could film at the farm, i didn't realize... that half of hollywood would show up at my doorstep.
"at least revel in the irony that they've chosen a single-theater town... to shoot their bazillion-dollars ""warrior angel"" film."
who really need the extra added headache of... worrying about tables for two and wardrobe remorse on a movie night.
rachel is very busy, so keep it short and don't ask for an autograph.
no problem.
miss davenport, your guest has arrived.
attention, everyone.
mr. kent and i need a little one-on-one.
today we shoot the famous date scene.
warrior angel's about to stand me up.
in his defense, i'm sure he has a good excuse.
anyway, i just wanted to thank you... personally.
i'm sorry to interrupt, ms. davenport, but... this girl said she absolutely needed to speak to clark.
well, i didn't want to freak her out, but chloe might have found a clue about the attacker.
turns out that not all the fans are enthusiastic about the film's interpretation.
in the comics, warrior angel's girlfriend dies.
there's one poster, devilicus rebel, who's becoming more and more aggressive.
"""when will davenport learn our hero lives in solitude?"""
her blood will unleash the truth.
grew up on a farm with two dogs, only child, home-schooled.
looks like our 19-year-old from minnesota keeps a flawless record.
keep searching.
i just read about your heroics in the paper.
who needs warrior angel when we've got our own clark kent?
actually, that's why i'm here.
i was wondering if you could help me with a reference.
you're the biggest warrior angel fan i know.
was a fan.
i haven't picked up a comic since we were friends.
back when i saw life as black and white.
when i realized good and evil was gray, the stories lost their magic.
though i have to admit, yours is the last nose i'd expect to find in a comic.
what's going on, clark?
how did he escape, marilyn?
i don't know.
i'm not paying you to make mistakes.
don't say a word.
clark, hi.
just watching a movie with aunt nell.
of course, i'll pick up rachel as soon as i can.
if i'm devilicus, what is the worst possible thing i could do... to warrior angel to make him accept his destiny?
i know it's not easy being a superhero's girlfriend, lana.
but clark has to face his destiny alone.
thanks... for showing me smallville had more to offer than a tax break.
i signed onto warrior angel for publicity and a paycheck,
but after meeting you, i'm starting to believe that heroes really do exist.
i sure hope that comment about a sequel was a joke.
you okay?
just thinking about what ben said.
millions of people look up to warrior angel.
what if those people could look up to you instead?
well, lana, there's not even a million people in smallville.
for the first time in my life, i have everything i've ever wanted, and it's right here on this farm with you.
i don't mind being kept awake, but at least tell me why you're all so merry.
you haven't heard!
they haven't heard!
they haven't heard the events so we'll tell the story to you.
you may think it all nonsense though every word is true.
can you give us an explanation?
you want an explanation?
we'd be happy to relate the whole story
since everything here is now hunky-dory
so be patient and have yourselves a glass
and let's go back to early today.
so be patient and have yourselves a glass
and let's go back to early today.
and let's go back to early today.
leave us alone, pal.
shut up, you fool.
what do you want, beatrice?
nothing.
excuse me.
no, she's a neighbor.
but she didn't know i was doing your portrait.
you're probably wooing her.
we're just sort of engaged.
why do you bother with michel?
you always run after him.
you love him.
well, that's your business.
you always wait on him.
i promised to mend his old jacket.
i was bringing it back.
it's too old to mend.
anyway, i've had enough.
sure, he's a nice fella.
he's short, not good-looking, and he has a big nose.
but you're so soft on him.
me, soft on him?
the gentleman's not in.
i'm wise to people's tricks when they're flat broke.
when you can't pay, you don't go shopping.
thief!
him, a thief?
how can you accept that?
if you don't like it, come on out.
i'll have your furniture impounded.
it's better not to answer people like that back.
why don't you just pay the man?
because i'm hard up right now.
but not for long.
i'm expecting some money.
how annoying.
it's the third time we've been interrupted since i arrived.
no way to see the fellow.
they're awful people, these artists, these doodlers!
he owes me 2 months.
and 2 months' rent!
let me get my hands on him.
same here.
we'll have his furniture impounded tomorrow.
i'll be here with this gentleman.
we'll impound.
enough is enough.
this has gone on too long.
going, wanda dear?
look at how you're dressed!
relax, i'm the boss now.
here, pal...
why the get-up?
because it's your turn.
why should i play the servant alone?
close your door when you entertain your mistresses.
but beatrice...
you let her insult me!
no, wanda, don't go.
you're being ridiculous, beatrice!
wanda, listen!
you'd do better to pay the milk maid.
quiet, you old bat!
scoundrel!
so there you are!
and now, young man, you can pay my bill.
and mine.
you owe me, too.
and my bill.
i don't settle bills in stairwells.
there's a lady present.
your business doesn't concern me.
i'll leave you to your friends.
goodbye, my dear.
good day, gentlemen.
i won't stand for your penny-pinching manners.
stop, thief!
catch that one.
he went that way, he'll come this way
stop, thief!
stop that man, i say!
what are you doing here?
please, young lady, not a word.
you come into my room, take that jacket...
do you enjoy the piano?
what?
who's after you?
are you in debt, too?
why are they after you?
listen, child, you've just done me a great, great service.
if ever you need a helping hand, count on me.
grandpa tulip.
23, rue des vieilles haudriettes.
are you done playing?
why?
i have to run out the door.
then i won't keep you.
would you mind if i kept the jacket?
but it's not mine.
it's worthless.
let go!
will you let go of me!
i'll put the cuffs on you.
let go!
you're hurting me!
what d'you want?
will you pay us?
will you pay us?
will you pay?
we'll count to three.
we'll count to three.
one...
two...
three...
yes!
what's got into you?
one of us is a millionaire.
millionaire?
that's right, fella...
no. 27009 wins 1 million florins
the dutch lottery!
the tickets!
what's this nonsense?
listen, please!
the tickets!
you noted the numbers.
my notebook.
i don't know.
let's make a deal.
whether it's you or me, we split it, okay?
no way, old man.
if it's me, i keep it all.
see how he is?
this joke's gone far enough.
you'll see.
split or no split?
not a cent.
okay.
well?
dammit!
say, what's a million florins come out to?
imagine that!
imagine that!
you'll all be paid tomorrow.
how do we know you have this ticket?
a good point.
gladly.
upwards, upwards, to the light up there.
the baker...
the butcher...
the grocer...
the dairy maid...
we shall bear witness to his virtue.
do you remember where i put the ticket?
no, i don't, old man.
beatrice has it.
stay here, old man.
watch the door till she gets back.
my fortune's in this room.
i can't show you the ticket now.
look, we'll come back later.
you'll see it soon enough.
some port, gentlemen!
don't worrry.
i'll go fetch a bottle.
bring a dozen, while you're at it.
and some pastries.
and champagne.
and then...
i'll leave it up to you.
so long as it's quality stuff.
gentlemen, please, take a seat.
millionaire!
millionaire!
that beggar, that bohemian?
the fellow in the studio.
millionaire!
the one who never pays?
what a lucky fellow!
he'll be paying me now.
sure, it's easy when you're a...
millionaire!
the million's been won!
get your lottery results!
enough money to burn.
gentlemen, to his health!
miss, you're needed at home.
what for?
dunno.
they just sent me.
what happened?
you can run along.
i'm parked just outside.
is michel here?
police.
you sure?
i think so.
what do you want?
what are you doing here?
i came to...
who are you?
who am i?
i am ambrosio sopranelli.
tenor at the new york met.
tenor?
prove it.
sing!
do you see my visage which betrays no alarm?
o angel mine,
all danger i shall decline.
o angel mine!
goodbye, michel.
goodbye, my love.
michel, here comes beatrice.
i'm a millionaire.
the jacket, beatrice.
yes, the jacket.
what for?
my lottery ticket's in it.
you don't have it?
where did it go?
you forgot your cane, sir.
why return his cane?
to pinch his watch.
they were chasing him, you see...
i don't know...
it was an old, beat-up jacket...
i didn't think...
no mistake about it.
it's gone for good.
go on, fella.
don't panic.
you can't tell them what happened.
in the name of all the tenants here, so proud to know a millionaire, accept this bouquet of flowers and may your happiness be ours.
didn't the man who took the jacket leave a name or address?
but i think... it was like the name of a flower.
something like grandpa rose.
grandpa tulip.
i'm sure of it.
and his address?
the address, i don't know.
tilt your head a bit...
that's it.
imagine, this picture will be in all the papers tomorrow.
hold it right there.
smile.
that's it.
but isn't there a way to find his address?
it should be easy to find a tulip in paris.
look, i'm going to give michel a hand.
wait a minute...
smile.
smile.
that's it.
does she have any clues?
no, nothing.
look here, i want to do something for you.
if i find the ticket, do we split it?
then go look for your ticket.
if you call that friendship...
why did you ask?
it was just a hunch i had.
oh, why not!
i have nothing to lose now.
it's a deal?
it's a deal.
word of honor?
then you're on, pal.
don't hold your breath.
tulip...
i'm so sorry.
and we needed the money to get married.
that's out of the question now.
why?
forgot already?
i'll never forget.
but you'll find your million.
oh, so what.
he went off to find him.
prosper?
what's the name?
grandpa tulip.
oh, why bother!
i'm not going to start chasing after this tulip fellow.
23, rue des vieilles haudriettes.
that's grandpa tulip's address.
good heavens!
we are the foot soldiers of inequality
we redistribute wealth and private property.
at ease.
gentlemen, i almost got arrested today.
anyone on guard outside?
young laborde.
good.
let's get to work.
are you grandpa tulip?
what can i do for you?
i'm michel bouflette.
what jacket?
the jacket a young lady lent you this morning, when you were in bad straits.
i'm here for the jacket you borrowed from me.
but it was worthless.
this man was wearing a superb jacket.
a great artist must pay attention to the slightest details.
"i'm all set to sing ""the bohemians"" in this costume."
my watch!
my watch chain!
but why sell the jacket to a singer who's going to america?
how should i know?
he said it was for a role.
a role?
do you know his name?
we bought his watch.
so what if you did?
it may have his name inside.
exactly.
the watch, son.
good idea.
you're crochard, alias the tulip.
me?
who's watch is that?
just what i'd like to know.
don't get funny with me, buster!
take him away.
we are the foot soldiers of legality
no bandit can escape the police
gentlemen, this jacket business looks very suspect to me.
so tonight we go to the opera lyrique and we get that jacket.
michel, michel, how can you sit there?
when will you be a millionaire?
you won't stop the clock by whining
the meter's running, the price is climbing!
mr. prosper benevant?
report to the station.
why?
they arrested a man who claims to know you.
he lost his papers.
we need you to identify him.
i'll be right down.
ambrosio sopranelli.
ambrosio...
sopa...
sopranelli.
i'm singing tonight at the opera lyrique.
i'm off to america to sing my repertoire.
repert...
carmen, paillasse, rigoletto.
that watch meant a lot to me.
i'm sure grandpa tulip stole it.
the police does its job.
here's your watch.
and here's grandpa tulip.
is this yours?
so you bought my jacket.
the one grandpa tulip wore.
but it's mine.
so you admit to being grandpa tulip.
are you or aren't you grandpa tulip?
be quiet.
no, i'm trying to explain...
it's important to me.
excuse me, but the watch is mine.
the jacket is mine.
everything is mine.
the jacket's mine.
take them away.
my jacket!
don't let it get away!
may i go?
sit down.
prosper, quick!
what is it?
sir, here's the person for the interrogation.
fine.
go fetch this tulip fellow.
just a moment, sir.
it's all right.
wait outside.
wait, wait...
and the meter's running...
i can't help you.
can i go now?
sit down, you!
do you know this gentleman?
me?
not at all.
is this a joke?
i never saw him before.
never saw me before?
sure, i saw him a moment ago when he was making a fuss...
it's the first time i saw him.
he's known me for over 20 years.
that's a lie.
i don't know him.
you don't know me?
you don't know me?
no, i don't know him.
no one asked you.
hey, you, do you realize what you're doing?
you bet, i do.
why are you doing this?
can't you guess?
no, i can't.
this morning you said we'd share the million if i found the ticket.
i'm going to break your neck.
i'm going to break your neck, you hear!
don't forget your hat.
you'll pay for this.
can i go, sir?
you're free to go.
prosper, what have you done?
prosper, what have you done?
as a friend, you're no paragon
prosper, what have you done?
best not to give another thought to the remorse your acts brought
go spend a moment or two with a charming lady friend
i don't understand this.
so you'll get the million?
michel and i each have a claim on the ticket.
it all depends on how generous i want to be.
then you're a rich man.
i'm so happy... for you.
prosper, how can you dare?
let the voice of virtue declare
see your friend, see his state
prosper, how can you dare?
it's him!
this is michel bouflette?
you'll vouch for him?
so swear we, he's the millionaire.
so swear we, mister commissioner.
no law can make us forswear.
we, his friends, shall set him free.
so swear we, so swear we.
so swear we, mister commissioner.
so swear we.
it's about time.
you have to pay up.
that's enough!
wait at my place while i run over to the opera lyrique.
if you want your money, you have to drive me.
i'm not used to working this way.
i can't buy gas with promises.
it's for the bouquet.
just when i'm about to sing.
but i only wanted to ask...
get out of here!
when would you like these ladies to throw you the bouquet?
at the end of act one, after the love duet.
make sure it's in my direction.
did you understand?
you can count on us.
so, you're one of my greatest admirers?
oh, yes.
you're so handsome in that costume.
wait until you see me with my beard.
look.
tell me, child, why don't we speak after the performance?
come to my dressing room after the final curtain.
oh, certainly, maestro.
nothing could make me happier.
see you later.
what is it, child?
nothing.
i just wanted to see you.
how sweet.
you're in the ballet?
yes, i'm dancing.
i've heard you sing so often.
then you'll be delighted to hear me on stage.
you're so charming.
would you mind if i watch you put on your makeup?
well... of course, take a seat.
she's irresistible.
you have such a nice voice.
she's so charming.
would you pass me the jacket there, child?
here.
here.
thank you.
isn't she adorable!
will you come see me after the performance?
who is it?
they're waiting.
coming.
so you'll come?
coming?
excuse me, i'll be right there.
until later.
did you get the ticket?
why not?
someone was with him.
i saw the jacket.
hello, michel.
working for prosper now?
but i'm not.
yes, you are.
let me explain.
who are you?
thief!
let me out of here!
stop him!
don't let him get away!
i might be her brother!
i might be her father!
i won't be kept waiting.
that's not the costume!
"that's the ""bohemian"" costume."
but we start with the love duet.
that's right.
no one told me.
on stage, madame.
we're locked in!
let us out!
let me go!
on stage!
quick!
quick!
now it's my turn!
i refuse to change.
what are you doing backstage?
but you can't!
the public's waited long enough.
what?
sopranelli waits for no one.
i won't stand for criticism.
what will the audience think?
leave them to me.
alone are we at last tonight
all else to their slumbers have gone
alone are we in the failing light
side by side upon this bench of stone
what sorrow clouds thy sense?
o heart, what is my offense?
o pity, see how i grieve
yes, great is my adversity
there is no balm, no reprieve
thou lovest me not, i who love thee
heed not thy jealous heart
nothing shall keep us apart
we are alone in the forest
this blessed place is our shrine
let your hand in my hand rest
and our fingers forever entwine
i lack the force to resist thy pleas
i feel so weak when thou art near
let me gaze into thine eyes
let thy love be all most dear
let us forget sorrows past
let us sad thoughts outcast
our pain shan't our love unsettle
the breeze on this night so fair
carries off our coupled sighs
far away toward distant skies
in the forest deep are we alone
what care we of fortune's sting?
why do you keep stroking your beard like that?
i believe we've met before, child.
think hard.
grandpa tulip.
don't count on me for any more jackets.
the troubles i've had over that!
look, sir, you promised to help me.
you'll have your jacket, child.
there's not a minute to lose.
honest?
yes, go on.
you promise?
i promise.
i'll get it?
thank you, sir.
gentlemen...
the bohemians opera in three acts
that's our only happiness!
we are alone, o angel mine!
join me beneath the scented pine.
what sight do my eyes take in?
laurence in this place of sin?
impure girl, get thee hence
or my wrath shall chastise thee!
i laugh at your violence!
she laughs at his violence!
anger takes its toll.
we must keep them apart.
assassin of my heart!
ravisher of my soul!
mother, thy face i descry.
son, i hear thee cry.
i die.
you die.
he dies.
o tragic demise!
laurence, hear me now.
hear me now, my dearest.
now even the stars do bemoan
this life by my hand bereft.
of my last friends, none are left...
but what care i for remorse
when i love thee.
thou lovest me!
till death do us part!
i've been around the block a dozen times.
here he comes now.
next time i'll hit you with a ticket.
where to now?
the police station?
home?
where's home?
you were waiting there this morning.
will i get paid this time?
sure, sure, you'll get paid.
it's about time.
you tire me out.
michel, michel, how can you sit there?
the meter's running, the price is climbing.
with a pocketful of gold.
the jacket!
it was on the roof.
that's great!
shut up!
don't, michel, stay here!
after them, you idiot!
they're getting away.
after them?
risk my life for an honest living?
i've got a wife and i might have kids some day.
if you don't want to pay, say so.
i'll take you to the cops.
no, you didn't hear.
i cooled my heels...
look for yourself.
come in, ladies and gentlemen.
you ought to be glad.
we did things right.
that's for sure.
tell me, are all these folks creditors?
not all of them.
they're neighbors.
they brought friends to see you.
how nice of them!
driver, have a glass of champagne and some cake.
sure.
he's flat broke.
who's paying for this?
so it's me.
that's more like it.
a million?
then why wouldn't he pay his fare?
he didn't have his lottery ticket then.
but he has it now.
we should ask to see it.
do you have the ticket?
that's just what i was saying...
well then...
come on.
what?
the lottery ticket.
the million.
oh, you want to see the...
well, then, i'll show you the...
your attention...
gentlemen, i have some news.
some bad news.
we aren't always masters of our fate.
is miss beatrice here?
no, that's enough, please, leave me alone.
i kept the ticket in a jacket, and this jacket...
the jacket!
but the jacket's empty!
the jacket's empty.
explain the problem to me.
the ticket was in it.
what ticket?
the lottery ticket.
i was asked to bring back a jacket...
it's the ticket i want.
so i brought a jacket.
the lining!
there was a ticket in the pocket.
what ticket?
the lottery ticket!
it would have been easy, because it's right here.
the ticket that was in the jacket.
money isn't everything, so beware!
well that's what folks pretend.
money isn't everything, so beware!
so say folks who are intelligent to folks without a cent
and there you have it!
police!
ready?
freeze, fbi!
all clear.
check upstairs.
turn around.
keep them there.
all clear.
you won't find a goddamn thing!
i can tell you that right now.
ain't got shit on me.
move, shitbird.
fbi, show me your hands!
nice.
bingo.
and on today's chip franklin show at noon...
chip will be live at arundel mills mall asking local retailers:
"""what do you get for the guy who has everything?"""
now here's steve stewart with sports.
we could take him now.
not enough profile.
fucking feds.
be advised, target 27 is on the move.
why leave vondopoulos out on the street?
the text message that told him to clean up, it came from someone higher up.
someone we don't know.
we leave him on the street after these raids... he'll probably make contact with whoever's above him.
either another text message or a meet.
what's with george glekas?
i'm afraid he's gonna duck this warrant.
chester karol sobotka?
it's frank sobotka's kid.
frank's kid kills one of our targets?
are you shitting me?
we hit the store this morning.
every shred of paper's gone.
just a bloodstain on the floor.
so we go over to his house a half hour later with the warrant... and it's full up with red-eyed greek relations looking at us like we're braindeads.
homicide, shea.
who caught the highlandtown murder the night before last?
jay landsman, sir.
i'll be right over.
go get the interviews started.
what the fuck is that about?
how did we do this morning?
glekas, i'm not sure.
you don't wanna know.
jesus, larry...
the thing is, i think we gotta reach out to a criminal lawyer real quick.
if the union guys can't handle this mess... he's gonna have a bail hearing tomorrow.
do you have any details?
look, everything's gonna be fine.
he's here.
got another problem here, larry.
big man on the docks.
you don't look so big now, do you?
ma.
pop.
it's gone.
and the money, too.
they say you need to come in.
they said the warrant is at southeastern police district.
they're out there now.
showtime, franky.
is it just you, or is it the whole union?
what's your comment on the charges being brought against you?
how will you answer the charges against you?
let me ask you, who exactly am i working all these dead girls for?
the homicide unit, right?
the same homicide unit that can't put two and two together and pick up a phone... leaving me to read it a day-and-a-half later in the baltimore sun.
fuck.
they cleaned everything else?
even for a supremely fucked-up police department... this takes the prize.
how'd the kid play it?
he signed a full statement.
he said that there was an argument about a stolen car or two.
think he'll open up and talk more?
he's been processed and assigned a pd.
if you want to take a run at the kid, you're gonna have to get around his lawyer.
what's your name?
state your name.
there is your name.
state your name.
no name?
for now, we'll just call you boris.
boris.
"why always ""boris""?"
conspiracy to violate federal customs statutes.
white slavery.
today we're only charging the customs violations, mr. sobotka.
but eventually, a grand jury indictment will expose you to a lot more.
name names, and come clean.
you help yourself and your union.
help my union?
for 25 years, we've been dying slow down there.
dry docks rusting, piers standing empty.
my friends and their kids, like we got the cancer.
and now you wanna help us?
help me?
listen to this, mikey.
i wanna know it wasn't your people... dropped that body on potee street the other night.
i'm asking 'cause it was someone with a greek-ass name... and fuck if he wasn't dumped in front of a house i was using.
we hit your suppliers.
we also have photographs tying you to your stash house... and putting you at the greek's warehouse over on newkirk street for re-ups.
do yourself a solid here, mike.
what's the plan?
this is just a detention hearing, frank.
you're not a flight risk, you have no meaningful priors.
and so far they've only hit you with one count.
the magistrate's gonna ask us some basic questions.
barring anything unforeseen, you're out in an hour.
he's what, greek?
you know, from that jew country they got.
and what about the guy they call sergei?
sergei's straight muscle.
look, i need something to eat.
two hot dogs and a strawberry soda.
i'd fuck the order up.
it's gotta be strawberry?
hook a brother up.
big man, that ain't gonna work for omar.
it's all right.
been what, a year?
boy, you don't know, i been dreaming of running into you again.
i think you've done enough.
wee-bey copped out to all them murders.
he in jail now forever and a day.
avon, he out of pocket for the time being.
leaving you.
you looking for closure?
lookit, man, ain't no closure.
not unless brandon walk up out his grave and come up in this room right now.
see, all i know is whoever did him that way, they gets got.
whoever did him that way, they still out there right now.
so now you gonna play like you had nothing to do with it.
no, i can't lie.
anything after that, part of the game.
bird and them were there to see it.
but another man did all the extras:
all that cigarette shit... all that bullshit with the eyes.
the brutal shit, that's his calling card.
nyc?
yeah, small dude.
what he go by?
brother mouzone.
i know you heard of him, right?
why?
what happened to your boy was business.
but how that shit happened, you got the right to take that to heart.
i figure that'll make us even.
now, you wanna know where this nigger is?
the man's right.
let's grab a cup of coffee or something.
not now, i need to get clean.
sergei and them... they did mau mau willis.
why'd they chill him?
he was welshing on the jew.
who's above those two, mike?
you don't know?
never did wanna know.
god in heaven, zig, the cops do that to you?
ain't the cops.
lawyers are saying the bail might be tough.
i'm trying.
you know i'm trying, right?
i got tired.
i got tired of being the punchline to every joke.
you had problems, you could've come to me.
you could've said something.
you wouldn't have heard.
you were always too busy dredging up the canal.
making sure the right bum got elected.
buying another round for the house.
i always used to think you were working all them hours you spent away.
it was all work, zig, even when it wasn't.
for you, for your mother.
i bet you didn't even tell her i was in here, did you?
maybe you did... and she already took three nembutals, sleeping the day away.
pop... when i seen what i did to that kid down at the store... it made me sick to my stomach.
that ain't you, zig.
because the same blood don't flow for us, pop.
i mean, i wish it did, but it don't.
you're more like me than you know.
you're a sobotka.
fucked is what i am.
what the fuck can i say?
"best progress so far is ""white mike"" mcardle."
he's standing on the edge of the cliff.
we're gonna get pearlman in today to see what she can do to step him off.
also, we're still hunting the sobotka nephew.
herc and carver are on that.
still, my guess is the drug players... even if they roll, give us eton and sergei.
boy, them greeks and those twisted-ass names.
ass-fucking, too.
what exactly do we know about vondopoulos?
we should stay on him, see who he really is.
how about it?
throw us a few of your well-equipped surveillance teams?
in case you haven't noticed, lieutenant, i'm the only fed still in the room.
the us attorney has what he wants with the union guys... which means my field office is pretty much over this case.
okay, we're on vondopoulos ourselves.
i'm sorry for him... and for you.
we should've paid more attention to our own.
like i could've stopped ziggy from what he'd done.
like anyone could ever control him.
i was thinking of my boy, too.
they're dropping the net on all the guys.
ain't no secret things get lost in them cans now and again.
he'll be all right.
they tossed my house, frank.
they don't do that when there's a couple of cases of vodka missing.
they made me sign the search warrant.
that's a receipt-like for what they found.
no, that ain't right.
that can't be right.
you knew?
and once nicky got used to boosting stuff and seeing a little money... what did you think he was gonna do?
turn straight all of a sudden and give it up?
no, frank.
once you gave him a taste on the house, just...
everything i did, the cans i let through... the money we got from that went to keeping what we had.
god damn it, frank!
uncle frank, with the big shoulders.
"""he can fix it."""
hey, killer.
you got the new harper's yet?
some titty mags, too, if you need.
i'm gonna hook you up, though, all right?
told you i had something for you.
there you go.
that's my good boy.
good day for a ship.
this is the hiring hall, frank.
working stevedores only.
big roy, let me have your card.
what do you want my card for?
i'm gonna work the cape st. george today.
end of the week, you get paid.
hey, phil.
i'm putting up for the cape st. george.
i don't see no resemblance.
we're both bald, we're both polacks.
what the fuck else you need to know?
who's gonna work for me?
a different look for our boy.
perry ellis or something.
okay, i'm guessing.
it's a joseph abboud.
he puts dark buttons instead of brass on his blazers.
that's the abboud signature.
you know what they call a guy who pays that much attention to his clothes, right?
a grown-up.
we're up.
maybe you ought to set up an easel on the sidewalk...
and do a sketch instead.
i'm fine.
anything i ought to know?
windows, mirrors, reflections, anything like that.
stay on my frequency, hear?
vondopoulos should be coming out of the garage on foot...
she wasn't much when we started, you know.
but now she's got game.
thank you.
i got him going into a fifth floor room.
note the number then get down to the lobby.
she's got vondopoulos in a room.
it could be a while.
copy.
all this shit's going out to chassis?
that's what they tell me.
copy.
11-34.
subject and companion, blue suit, leaving the hotel any moment now.
copy, we got the eyeball.
the man with vondopoulos has got to be big.
we leave the benz here?
it's hot.
negative.
these nine here still got to be stripped.
harder than it looks.
who was the room registered to?
he gave a northwest d.c. address.
we should run out the paper trail on this guy, see what we turn up.
he rolls on his suppliers, and he can walk with a long probation.
why have the feds with you if they're not gonna step up every now and then?
wait a second.
you're gonna give a drug dealer a ride like that?
what about frank sobotka?
the feds took a shot at him and got nothing.
or so they tell me.
the way i read it, they cared more about busting up the union...
you can't make him any kind of specific offer yourself.
only i can do that, and only after i get an okay from my front office.
there's no better messenger, counselor.
take a shot.
you going to his house?
i shouldn't even be seen with you at this point.
i just wanna settle our business while we still can.
it ain't like i'm gonna get my hands on more cash, obviously.
the grain pier is dead.
half the votes we had lined up are walking sideways now.
they read the paper, frank.
i'm not gonna lie.
no one is gonna stand with us now that the fbi is on you.
they're scared.
of what?
they took the money, frank.
and now if they deliver the votes, they figure the feds will be on them, too.
i'm sorry, frank.
you find a way of putting this fbi thing to bed... maybe we can come back the next session with the grain pier.
you'll have a couple of people down there knowing they owe you a vote or two.
i don't know what else to say.
you know what the trouble is, brucie?
we used to make shit in this country.
build shit.
now we just put our hand in the next guy's pocket.
i'm not hungry.
all this trouble.
so, our associates, they are strong?
i don't worry about our people.
we can try to get them out before the trial.
if not, they will stand for us.
we have shown them too much.
there will be no more trouble.
we must make certain of this.
maybe there's another way.
there is only one sure way.
hear me out.
if i could guarantee that frank sobotka and his nephew... would be silent... wouldn't you prefer that?
but you cannot guarantee this.
frank's son, the idiot who shot george in his store... he is going to jail for a long time... unless...
there was a young clerk wounded that day in the store.
the prosecutors want to use him as a witness.
i know his family.
frank sobotka will have his son back.
if a man can have this, why would he talk to the police?
what about frank's nephew?
he is the idiot's cousin.
he wants the same thing as frank.
anyway, i don't worry about niko.
you are fond of him, spiros.
you should've had a son.
but then i would've had a wife.
if this maggot doesn't post by midnight, i'm gonna take it personal.
the shitbird lives in his parents' basement.
where's a guy like that gonna run?
you wanna go with auntie tasha?
nice and easy, honey.
all right, come on, baby.
what's up, big man?
where the party at?
ain't no party up in here, girl.
we thought darnell and everybody was gonna get their smoke on.
don't you know darnell?
what's this good boy's name?
hey, boy.
how you doing today?
you been good?
this a good boy.
there it is.
car will be running.
what is it, lamar?
no need to prolong this.
no, we got time.
i'm saying, ain't you wanna know?
not particularly.
about a year ago, a boy name brandon got got here in baltimore.
stuck and burned before he passed.
see, that boy was beautiful.
wasn't no need for y'all to do him the way y'all did.
you feel me?
a year, you say?
about that.
you've got some wrong information.
man, you lying to live.
i'm at peace with my god.
do what you will.
so you know?
what happened to your boy, it's not my style.
the way you bleeding out your back, looks like that bullet bore clean through.
9 mm at close range will do that.
i wanna report a shooting over here at the new motel.
my pal, beatrice.
what, you gonna run me in again?
isn't that like double jeopardy or some shit?
stop it, just stop it.
talk to me.
and say what?
i'm sitting here trying to figure it out myself.
it didn't happen overnight.
i knew i was wrong.
but in my head, i thought i was wrong for the right reasons, you know?
there are different kinds of wrong.
what're you doing here, bea?
because you want to.
i'm opening a door here, frank.
i can't promise you anything.
we'll start from there.
you're better than them you got in bed with.
maybe we didn't.
you think he ditched the benz because he picked up the tail?
nicky from the docks.
if you hadn't called last night, i'd have never found you.
relax, niko, come on.
it's like i told you on the phone.
i should have never gone down the road with you people.
you tried to make something of yourself.
there's no harm in that.
and you still have friends.
i'm busted.
we will be a friend to him, too.
nothing is done, niko.
nothing.
take a look.
that's not your name.
many names, many passports.
we can do many things.
what can you do for ziggy?
we ask only loyalty.
why do they need sticks?
can't they kick it with their feet?
she asked me straight-up to come in, so i'm here.
first, we need to know what you're looking for.
we don't want any misunderstandings later on.
i'm just looking for, you know, some help with my son.
he can't jail where they got him.
we move him to a county facility.
but for his cooperation and yours... we can live with straight probation.
but what we can and cannot do for you and your family...
i got dirt on all of them.
i'll give you the greek, all them sons of bitches... just to have it off my chest.
just look to my son and my nephew.
mr. sobotka, at this point i have to advise you... you need to retain the services of an attorney.
we're not gonna do this now?
you need to have a lawyer present in the room.
you have that, we can make this happen first thing tomorrow.
mr. sobotka, i gotta ask.
why did you stop using your cell phone?
you guys flagged it.
you think i didn't know?
under the bridge?
these guys, they got a big operation to protect.
they're global-like.
they're really something?
you got no idea.
i think i got a pretty clear picture of what they're about.
we ain't talking about a bunch of thieves rolling drums of olive oil off the docks.
heroin?
you ain't much more than a kid.
i flushed my fucking family, for what?
a condominium.
i ain't going down there.
what i'm gonna do is, i'm gonna go in and talk with the police.
i'm gonna do to those cocksuckers what they did to me.
you can't do that.
they wanna meet with us on ziggy.
they can lean on that witness... that kid that he shot, the one that was there in the store.
the kid's gonna say that double g had the gun.
that it was like self-defense or some shit.
ziggy could walk, uncle frank.
he could.
and for that they want what?
motherfuckers!
i'll hear them out.
you ain't dealing with those guys no more.
uncle frank, me and spiros...
i don't fucking want you with me, nick!
go home!
your way... it won't work.
sidney poitier's performance was... fabulous.
i'm right at the part where he's starting to build the chapel.
oh, i won't ruin it for you, then.
good morning, sister.
she's burning up.
she's turning blue.
we almost lost you, grace.
you should have let me go.
doing a little afternoon gardening, doctor?
just repotting this salvia divinorum.
it's not thriving as it should, and i'm determined to revive it.
and i have every confidence... you will.
i worry less for your plants than i do for your patients.
what... are you talking about?
the nurses have stabilized her for now, but if she takes another turn, i might have to send her to a real hospital.
we can't really afford to let the outside world get a look at your handiwork, now, can we?
i performed no sterilization, sister.
oh, arthur, you're back to your old tricks.
all of her girl parts have been scooped out.
i must say i don't care much for your insinuations, or your tone.
as the head of this institution, i demand to be spoken to with at least a modicum of respect!
you really think you're in charge?
you touch me again... you will die.
i hope this clarifies the chain of command, arthur.
you know it in your heart.
you know you're nothing but a filthy drunk!
you never did nothing for nobody!
here's your chance to do something!
i warned you about your dirty mouth.
they get real loud sometimes.
cursing won't help silence anything.
you're right, sister.
you know, sister... these slices look a little uneven.
i think there's something wrong with the slicer.
let me take a look at it.
i'm real good with machines.
oh, sister mary eunice, i'm so sorry!
sister jude's gonna be very angry with me!
don't look like english.
it's ancient aramaic.
miles... that name on the wall, how do you know it?
did you summon her?
we don't reward this kind of behavior.
have this wall scrubbed at once!
i don't mean this room, frank.
i mean this world.
i'm here to help you, if that's what you want.
help me.
shall i kiss you, miles?
shall i kiss you... and make this all go away?
who's there?
what are you that you can look upon me?
i'm just a simple nun.
a nun, perhaps... but not so simple.
something else resides in you.
i was invited, unlike you.
do you know why you seek me out, cousin?
the part that used to be pure.
the human girl you've taken hostage sings to me.
o, heavenly host, will you release me?
can you release me?
oh, shut up, you stupid sow!
she likes it here.
we like it.
you're grievously ill, grace.
i've been accused of having committed this savagery.
both you and i know it's not the truth.
at this stage, it would be easier just to let you die, but i will not be the one to take the fall for this.
you will require a strict regimen of medicines and round-the-clock care.
but you will live, grace.
if only to set the record straight.
it's all right.
everything accurate as, uh, far as you can remember?
yeah, i-i said these things, but i didn't confess.
it was a headshrinker trick.
kit, they're going to play the tape for the jury, and if i hear what this says you said i convict.
did you talk to grace, like i told you?
i mean, she can testify that she just saw alma.
my wife is not dead, and it proves i didn't do it.
second, they tell me she's real sick.
she might not even make it to the hearing.
you heard me calling?
death would be better.
i used to be scared of it.
but i'm not afraid anymore.
just let go.
i'm right here with you.
i think we need to have a little talk, don't you?
first of all, i want you to know that i'm not angry.
it was very wrong, and i don't blame you.
truth is, i probably shouldn't have brought you here in the first place.
i don't like to give up.
an impasse?
it doesn't matter how we do it.
we'll put you out.
please, no.
you won't feel a thing.
stop fighting!
what did you do to him?
nothing.
what makes you think it was my fault?
he almost killed me.
and he's not my boyfriend.
of course it wasn't your fault.
women are always the victims.
could you please just take me to the police?
you get into my car, and then you tell me what to do?
please stop the car and let me get out.
you leave; you abandon ship at the smallest sign of a storm.
you gonna get out of a car going 50 miles an hour?
why did she take ten years of marriage and flush it down the toilet?
why did i catch another man screwing my wife in my own bed?
no.
i can't take it anymore.
try not to move.
you'll be in terrible pain.
you've had quite the adventure.
back to briarcliff, where you belong.
oh, god.
oh, no.
oh, no, no...!
oh, god.
listen, listen.
what?
listen, listen.
one of... yours.
we have to get you help!
operator, get me the police.
oh, god, no!
hold on.
hang on.
hey, come on in.
excuse the clutter.
last night?
we had a gig at the white rose.
we had to go on without a singer.
i-i've, i've been a little under the weather.
it's pretty ripe in here.
barry called his cousin, and she got there by the third set.
what's this?
just a little something to tide you over.
you're out of the band, judy.
what, because of one gig?
it's not just the one gig.
you've been slipping for a long time.
we all noticed it, and it got real clear last night after barry's cousin filled in.
barry's cousin?
what, she's dinah shore all of a sudden?
he's been trying to get his fat cousin in there for months now.
no, this is a conspiracy.
this is a conspiracy against me!
i'm sorry.
wait, hey, what do i have to do?
come on, terry.
stop it.
come on.
i can make you feel real good.
stop it!
you smell of vomit.
there's a card in there, with a number.
a little girl got run down, and cops want to know if anybody saw anything.
we'll see you around.
the search continues tonight for the hit-and-run driver responsible...
excuse me, miss, is everything all right?
i'm fine.
who is this?
mary eunice, what have you done?
what have i done?
no, no, no.
the question is...
what have you done?
a 15-year-old unsolved hit-and-run case.
i was in your head, remember?
lose your place, old man?
don't even think about coming back here, judy.
i left something else there for you, too.
you jumped the gun again.
never trust a drunk.
i'm just the little girl who cried wolf.
what was so different this time?
all i ever wanted was my own family, my own children to teach and love.
why didn't i die that night?
that was when god revealed he had a plan for you.
he gave you a calling.
i've been living on borrowed time, haven't i?
you deserve some peace, jude.
you deserve a peace befitting your extraordinary, tireless efforts to find meaning in this life.
how long can you live on free coffee and crackers, jude?
the winters here are long, and they're very cold.
and the whiskey won't keep you warm.
it just rots your insides.
peace is so close, sister.
i'm ready.
but i need to do one last thing.
at least they could give her a bed for the night.
sorry, she's a fussy baby, this one.
so you were saying you were missy's teacher?
hank, you bringing that coffee?
so... you were her teacher, you say?
honey, they're not always in their habits.
i, uh... remember her little blue coat.
i bought that for her 'cause she pitched a full-on fit in the middle of filene's basement.
yeah, only woke up once around 1:00 a.m.
we keep her when missy does the night shift.
oh, missy, this is sister...
i thought someone ran over you.
i thought you died out there, on the street.
you mean back then, when i was a girl?
all these years, i've been... lighting candles for your soul and your parents.
the accident happened right about the time i was thinking of joining the church.
in fact, it was... one of the reasons that led me... to take the vows.
and recently, i've been struggling with my faith, wondering if i really belong in the church, and it made me think of you and your tragedy.
and here you are.
"the monster who left her there has to live with himself."""
you don't understand.
and all the others.
i am telling you, kit walker is innocent!
oliver thredson is bloody face.
i love your work, bloody face.
it's where he kills them.
it's where he violated me.
you're safe now.
she claims that dr. thredson attacked her.
she insists that kit walker is innocent.
well, state police got a different opinion.
my child, what are you doing down here?
only a day ago you were at the brink of death.
you should be convalescing.
i'm dr. arden's little miracle.
yet, i open my eyes, and i'm still at briarcliff.
can't say that's much of an improvement.
when i'm done cleaning up, you'll have to go.
actually, you have to go now.
stay away from her!
back up or i'll shoot you!
♪ happy birthday, dear helen ♪
♪ happy birthday to you ♪
happy birthday!
happy birthday, helen.
happy birthday.
isn't it gorgeous?
darling, it's gorgeous.
make a wish, mom.
help!
thank you, sweetheart.
just one.
a short one.
let's eat!
if i shoot those guys out there and plead temporary insanity, would you corroborate my story, huh?
oh, shit.
the alarm didn't go off.
julie has a test in her first period.
i have this stupid early faculty meeting.
wake up.
wake up.
we gotta go, darling.
good morning.
you know how hard it is to get a reservation at claire's this time of year.
thank you, thank you.
but you never said you made plans.
it was supposed to be a surprise.
i did.
the point is, i never said that you could go away for the weekend either.
is that true?
well, you're not going, and that's that.
great!
thanks a lot!
she has to be in school in seven seconds.
you gotta go.
hello?
can i help you?
nobody's supposed to be here this time of night.
so what are you still doing here?
aren't you in my music theory class?
nothing i play sounds adequate, not a single note i play.
well, it's not your notes that are wrong.
but you need to slow down.
try to... pay more attention to what happens in between the notes.
try to hold on to time.
what do you mean?
that's where you'll find what you're looking for.
in the distance between things.
and you really shouldn't be smoking in here.
let me know when you want to go.
i'll let you out.
i don't see it coming.
but i can feel it.
it's there.
hey, helen.
hi, donna.
hey, love.
well... actually, i was nowhere near this neighborhood, and i just thought i'd stop by and say hi.
no, no, no, it's perfect.
we're gonna go to lunch in a few minutes.
you don't have to eat.
you sure?
i'll see you later.
take care, honey.
hello, everyone.
after i've returned your essays, we'll discu-
we will....
excuse me.
sleep tight, sweetheart.
okay.
it was... incredible.
good night.
helen?
i love this car.
i know you do.
are you going to let me in on your secret?
what makes you think i have a secret?
don't you?
i'm just tired.
i always hate the beginning of the semester.
come on, let's go inside.
julie tried her very first carbonara sauce.
it was scary.
are you okay?
what are you doing here, honey?
i was at school.
what time is it?
it's 4: 15.
i must have slept like a rock.
can you - can you please help me with this math?
i really need to get this done before i leave.
yeah.
just give me a minute.
no.
i'm not going on a world trip, mom.
i'll be back in three weeks.
i know.
okay.
go, mom!
how'd it go?
good.
come here.
dad!
all right.
he is like the biggest fucking cliché on the block, okay?
like now it's her fault that he sleeps around like some fucking... dog in heat.
i thought only female dogs go into heat?
what do male dogs do?
it's a permanent condition for them that doesn't require a name.
we believe that life can be perfect.
so we are always miserable because it never is.
whereas they believe that even under the best of circumstances, life could maybe be improved.
so what are you saying?
that we should lower our expectations to a point that they're already met?
but you don't need to go back, david.
there's no room for improvement in his life.
he loves his life.
somebody should sue me.
helen, are you still in there?
helen?
helen!
what the fuck is going on?
sorry, i didn't feel well.
you disappeared without saying a word to us.
i'm sorry.
i should have said something.
listen, david, it doesn't have anything to do with you.
is there someone else?
is there?
is that what this is all about?
i'm sorry.
sorry for what?
helen, i used to know everything about you.
please stop interrogating me.
helen?
jesus christ.
oh, god!
helen!
david?
well, there's nothing physically wrong with your wife.
i've notified dr. barnes.
he's the neurologist on call.
you'll have to wait for dr. barnes.
give me the goddamn time of day, will you?
it seems the problem is psychiatric.
what the hell are you talking about?
look, this is....
well, i am the second opinion.
please wait for dr. barnes.
do you suffer from insomnia or hypersomnia?
have you been in a depressed mood almost all the time for more than two weeks?
helen?
almost.
have you had considerable weight loss or gain without a change in diet?
she lost some weight, yes.
are you unable to concentrate or think clearly?
no.
pardon?
i've been here before.
when?
12 years ago.
how long have you been married?
um, seven years.
so i understand you had no knowledge of this prior episode.
how come i didn't see this coming?
you should meet some of the clowns we have on suicide watch.
but it'll take at least two weeks before she feels a response to the antidepressants.
now, in some cases, the side effects can be quite uncomfortable, but they tend to subside after about two to four weeks.
nausea, drowsiness, night sweats, constipation, diarrhea, blurred vision, thirst.
helen is a... a happy, successful woman.
she loves her daughter.
let's go home, love.
come on.
helen.
please.
no.
they don't help.
it's too early to tell, you know that.
they just make it worse.
that's supposed to be temporary.
thank you.
how come we never talked about this?
you don't want to hear it.
try me.
i can't.
i'm sorry.
i want you to get these books for me and cancel my lunch meeting with lucas.
and tell him also that i want to continue the trial date.
uh, send them to my home address, please.
what's going on, david?
we'll deserve it.
i mean now.
wait...
we'll move for a continuance.
i'll call you tomorrow night.
stay away from me!
hey, i'm not going to touch you, okay?
i'll just sit here, okay?
i can't-!
i can't do this any more!
i will prescribe her a different medication.
but as long as she refuses to be hospitalized....
at this point, i can only help your wife if she wants to be helped.
that's the law.
i know the law!
but my wife is sick, and you're telling me you can't help her.
you're forgetting that these laws are designed to protect people like your wife, mr. leonard.
i need you to sign this.
it states that you're leaving against medical advice.
helen.
please.
all right, so i'll take you to your room now.
um, can i talk to you for a minute?
no, i don't want julie to know i'm here.
can we go someplace else?
that's not exactly something a mother is happy to share.
she never forgave herself for that.
she shut me out from the start.
i tried to fight it, but just ended up fighting her.
and i lost.
i tried, she wouldn't have it.
just pretended it never happened.
and then she moved on without me.
i'm not gonna let that happen.
don't be a jerk, david.
you think this is about love?
it isn't.
there is nothing you can do.
i don't believe that.
hey, it's okay.
don't be scared.
it's okay.
you're a great teacher, you know.
i'll never teach again.
you're just lost.
hold on a second.
jesus, mathilda.
what happened with her?
she's in my class.
she was in my class.
i should be in class.
helen, look at me.
how's julie?
she sends her love.
i don't want her to know why i'm here.
you can't keep it a secret from her.
i don't want her to know why i'm here.
well, then you have to keep her away from you.
she asked me, and i told her.
you had no right to do that!
oh, you had no right to do that!
i don't want you to talk to my husband about me.
it's all right, susan.
if - if i don't allow it, you can't talk to him about me, right?
if i don't want him....
if....
if i don't want you to talk to him, you won't?
why don't you sit down?
where are you going?
why do i have to tell you that?
you don't have to tell me that.
mom!
i'm so glad you're here.
me too, darling.
we kicked some serious butt on saturday, yes.
and david taped the whole thing, so we can watch it later.
come on, mom.
i have a better idea.
why don't the two of you go?
i have homework.
come on, sugar.
so if you consider these principles, schubert's sonata....
it would have amounted to something like....
that will be all for today.
i don't want to talk.
you're doing better.
yeah, well, i decided to be a good girl for a while.
top five worst pieces of advice from people who don't know what they're talking about.
take a vacation.
get a haircut.
redecorate.
try yoga.
top five ways of killing yourself.
top five reasons to live anyway.
i can't go back.
i can still see it all around me, but it's like i don't belong there anymore.
and i see....
i see how sad it makes david.
and i see... how sad it makes julie, and that makes it that much harder, but i can't go back.
and i am really sick of apologizing for it.
can you even begin to imagine what i thought happened to you?
hey, you're not the only one suffering here!
do you understand?
i don't think you know what it's like to live with the shadow of the woman you love!
hey, 13.
i just wanted to tell you that i'm going to spend the night at dad's.
i just wanted to give you and dave some space.
i don't know.
that fucking son of a bitch!
oh, no, david, don't bother.
why didn't you file my suppression motion with the judge?
look, man, i'm sorry, but i've got enough shit on my plate, all right?
i wish that there was something that i could do for you, david.
no, please don't go.
we'll talk tomorrow.
she's had enough for tonight.
make sure she doesn't take any more.
i need to take another sick leave.
julie, i want to, uh, speak to your mother alone for a moment, please.
i want julie to come and live with me.
she should stay with me for a while.
please don't do this, frank.
you can't take care of her.
and don't fight me on this.
you'll lose.
god, you're so lovely.
you can't just leave.
why don't i take you back to your room, and i can get the doctor.
where are my clothes?
you weren't wearing any when you were brought here.
i want to go home.
i'm sorry, but that's not possible.
your husband had you committed the day before yesterday.
i want to go home.
helen...
you almost died.
i'm sorry.
you don't need to apologize to me.
i almost didn't go home that night.
but you did.
i didn't want to go home.
you did go home, david.
she can't hold on to you.
it doesn't work like that.
can she hold on to you?
no.
you're not going to like what i have to say.
i think you should consider ect.
shock treatment?
but ect could help you.
and the side effects are most likely to be temporary.
no.
get out!
enough.
do you understand these proceedings?
yes.
would you care to explain them to me?
i see a handful of strangers who think they know what's best for me.
do you believe they know what's best for you?
i would like to decide for myself where and whose help i get.
you decided to take your own life, mrs. leonard.
that was very stupid of me.
but isn't it also true that this was, in fact, the second time you tried to kill yourself?
mrs. leonard suffers from severe suicidal depression.
without continued treatment and supervision, there's a serious risk she'll attempt suicide again.
she doesn't believe the medication is helping.
but she hasn't indicated that she plans on discontinuing it, has she?
this isn't just about the medication.
dr. sherman, has she indicated that she plans on discontinuing her medication?
nothing further, your honor.
i find that the state has not met their burden of proving with clear and convincing evidence that the patient is a danger to herself or to others.
take care of yourself and good luck.
so, that's it?
you'll throw away the life you had, forget about us, about julie, about everyone who loves you, and give up?
is that it?
well, it looks like that to me.
that's because you can't see it the way i see it.
and i assume she does, huh?
it's not your fault, david.
when are you gonna understand that?
you remind me of who i used to be.
isn't that worth fighting for?
helen?
isn't it?
julie's better off without me.
this is insane.
i'm taking you home.
i'm not going.
you don't know what you're saying.
okay, let's go.
who the fuck do you think you are, huh?
i want you to go!
god, i'm so sorry.
what makes her so special, hmm?
she doesn't ask me how i feel...
she knows.
i don't even dare to imagine.
but i know how i feel.
you're my life, helen.
without you and julie, the world means nothing to me.
i hope you'll remember that one day.
let's get out of here.
whose house is this?
it's my house.
are you cold?
let's go for a walk.
you're not going to make it go away, you know.
i never said i would.
she was sick for as long as i can remember.
then one morning she got up, and she made breakfast.
and after she cleared the table and sent me to my room, she hung herself.
and she left her eight-year-old daughter with that goddamn house.
so what do you think?
should i keep it?
or should i insure it really well and pay someone to burn it down?
i want you to know me, helen.
i've never wanted that from anybody.
helen!
helen?
death comes so close.
and with such promise.
nice hit, julie!
good job, julie.
thanks.
hey, you.
that was beautiful.
how are you?
did something happen to mom?
that's not why i'm here.
oh, god, i miss you.
i wanted to visit her in the hospital.
but dad didn't think that was a good idea.
he is such a wuss!
did you just call him a wuss?
yes, i did.
you think we'll ever be together again?
like we used to be?
straight answer?
straight answer.
i don't know.
do you know where she is?
julie?
are you mathilda?
is she here?
helen?
leave me alone, please.
mom?
my poor darling.
i'm sorry i left, mom.
no... no.
don't say that.
i am so sorry.
my dear child.
no matter how long the journey or how deep the descent in the end, all it takes is one last step.
between pain and nothing.
one single small step.
what i do remember is a sense that reality is thin.
i think it is thin, you know.
thin as lake ice after a thaw.
and we fill our lives with noise and light and motion to hide that thinness from ourselves.
how's it going?
i....
do we know each other?
absolutely not.
you'd like to change that?
helen.
stop!
stop!
mathilda?
jesus.
what are you doing here?
well, you weren't at the hospital.
i thought you were getting out tomorrow, no?
no, today.
i was gonna pick you up.
i thought it was tomorrow.
what am i doing?
hi.
i'm sorry about the mess.
