how about maybe he's playing this game that he's a very nice guy, everybody trusts him, just to win the game?
i'm probably, without knowing it, less lonely than i have been in a long time because i'm interacting with people more often than i have in many years.
if i had a son, i'd be proud if he was like daniel.
i'm not going back to a life or a job that i like or family or friends or even an ex-boyfriend, and i get that you're sad about that.
it's been a while since i've been with anybody, but i--

code-r is not a patient!
we shouldn't be arguing about that!
i am zero.
confirm the positions of the enemies now.
face to face confrontation.
surrender and submit to my army.
a layered foundation that can be broken up in order to counter earthquakes.
there's nothing weaker than that when all the floor parts are crumbled.
but how did zero get such help from the underground?
villetta and jeremiah guessed right after all?
that's wonderful then!
people are nothing more than chess pieces when they're up against the world.
the special force teams will try to suppress the airspace in the lower region.
your highness!
you vengeful ghost!
take this chance to return to the government office!
it's for princess euphemia's sake too!
i'm chosen by the princess... a knight chosen to protect the princess!
that's the same thing as the lancelot's?
we have already finished what we're supposed to do.
we haven't received any orders from the governor general to sortie either.
you'll be violating orders if you launch now.
but...
i will defeat zero with my own hands!
are we going to charge?
we have already set up a formation ahead.
i think that the enemies that are attacking up front are a diversion.
you'll move to the designated spot.
okay.
kallen will switch to providing backup.
what is the name of our supporter?
she's called shinozaki sayoko.
fleets from the chinese federation have been sighted gathering around the east china sea.
i will go.
advance!
they intend to conserve their forces while waiting for reinforcements.
you will follow our instructions.
this is the movement that'll change the world.
looks like we are able to film the great movie that the public is waiting for.
all the broadcasting stations are...
the order of the black knights!
rivalz...
let me act cool for once.
i already told you not to do anything to them.
you told us to make this place our headquarters...
i'll guarantee everyone's safety.
until the battle ends... the order of the black knights will defend this place.
but everyone in this school?
something... to me...
it came after all.
an eleven and i actually...
you guys will defend the front of the government office together with guilford.
euphemia-sama's...
darlton's analysis was right...
i shall destroy the current world and create a new era.
clovis... and even euphie!
looks like... it's pointless... to carry on this conversation.
mother knew that there would be an assault that day?
elder brother schneizel moved her corpse away under the orders of his excellency.
all hail britannia!
zero...!
you'll suffice then.
is the one who took nunnally a geass user?
our relationship as accomplices will continue.
i don't even remember whether i was originally a human or not.
or the people who like me.
everything has disappeared in the flow of time.
within the endless flow of time...
leave him to me.
!
what the heck is zero doing?
defend this place even till death!
zero has charisma...
abandoned japan?
was the trap at the entrance used to buy time?
euphemia mercilessly killed innocent japanese.
you hide within the shadows and all the responsibility is thrown at others.
don't you want to know zero's true identity?
you have the right to witness the truth as well.
i don't... believe it.
lelouch is...
i'm zero.
i lead the order of the black knights against the holy britannian empire.
and i'll eventually be the one who takes over the world.
you made use of us japanese?
japan will be liberated.
nunnally has been abducted!
i hope that you would help me to save nunnally.
there's nothing that we can't do together!
the world...
your wishes must not be granted!
shoot me if you intend to do so!
things from now on have nothing to do with you!
humans chase after the existence of happiness.
