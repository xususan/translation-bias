michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, the man he shared his bed with his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think you and i should sleep together.
yeah, i miss mom.
i'll tell him
i need to write a 000-word essay on the morality of war and the motion of a conflict.
i'm not sure our ethics teacher would like me to cheat while writing the essay.
so, you passed my ethics test.
in fact, george michael had been desperately burned to his teacher, the ethics teacher at beth baerly.
even a small-time crime... can cut through brutally.
no ring ring ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
the g.d.k.'s eye was on us.
your father thought it would make us look charitable.
he must have imitated my signature.
'maybe a year ago i'll have a son who will... finish his stunning cheese!
you have to get me out of this.
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't take care of her
i no longer have the compassion and milk of a mother.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of entertain girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm offering you an olive branch here.
yes.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
meanwhile, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
why am i telling you this?
i guess there's some things you can't tell your dad
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set up his teacher... to help him fulfill his maternal duty.
there's nothing wrong with that.
but i must say i'm a little hurt that you don't think about me.
halas can do that.
teachers can do that too.
sure, someday, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay's never been more proud of what she said in her life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i keep telling you.
girl, really... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma," you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache
yeah.
but gob mistook the emotional attention michael was treated with courtesy... and felt he was fighting to get involved.
because, you know, beyond adorable... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
_
and george sr. was about to get a surprise visit.
i've read all your teachings and bought all your tapes.
and i watched it all over again.
george sr. had recently marketed a series of tapes... to make money from his new discovery spirituality.
i also lost two pounds by eating your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to learn in your
this is a nice place to start.
and when michael got rid of two girls he was dating, he met lindsay at parent-teacher night.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this rape room have the same floor plan as our kitchen?
i think she's perfect for you.
i used to think that would help you get it out of your head.
besides, i can't rush a job and marry someone just because my son wants it.
i'm mrs. baerly, the ethics
my goal is to help my students understand the importance of life... that can be lost... by the thoughtlessness of the trigger.
and michael got to know his son's ethics teacher.
that's the "rrrr" part of it.
you know, it's frustrating.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you were laughing.
"rrrr!" - "rrrr!"! "rr
but, you know, you know, i'
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite something to drink?
or... or...
yeah, he's dead
i think that mr. daniels is having a stroke, so...
let's go get a drink.
yeah, maybe it will help.
george sr. was dealing with his own admirer.
i've already told you many of my sins.
maybe you could tell me a few of your sins.
well, there are legal implications to my sins.
but, back to your sins.
one of those things that happened about... at the university dorm again... tell me one of those things
and what's his meeting with miss bayerly, the second date today michael...
michael, that little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with him.
at least, i think it's him.
you have to strip it down to the pants to say something precise.
yes, mother.
they'll take him back.
don't take your shoes off, little man!
don't take your shoes off!
he's out of
who is it?
this is "annongong," your father and i adopted.
what, i go away for a few days and you find a new son?
lucille buster realized she was concerned, even jealous.
and she understood how it felt to be ignored.
annyong is your brother now, anny
call it off.
it stays.
listen, i'll call you again.
nice driving.
are you making dinner reservations?
a "little korean" did it.
and after their date....
michael took a step he hadn't taken in
okay, you think this is a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a great idea.
but how do we get inside without waking everyone up?
this may not be my best idea so far.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i loved.
i took something you liked.
i'm "nashbashbagerlajam."
listen, i know you're trying to get revenge on marta case.
i was lying when i said i wouldn't try to sleep with her, so...
he has to accept that.
i don't think there'll be any problems.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
really, luckily, i got rid of him.
no problem.
so romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden"?
hi, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i didn't know it was real.
but now... your ethics teacher...
yeah, i did that for her.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, as a matter of fact, i'm sure she's interested in him.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
about the class?
i mean, the one she loved my saddam
hi, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was she doing here?
michael knew he had a moral obligation to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with her.
well, why would he do that?
why did he sleep with my ethics teacher?
you and i know that, but gob just...
he's not one of the good snipers that targeted him, and he's almost everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think?
we don't know how old she is.
nobody knows.
she was accompanying the strange dance girls... and i thought i'd go up to her, do something... with a joke, and...
"hey, you wanna dance?"
and she was like, "ah, what the hell is it gonna be?" right?
i did it differently in the mirror, but...
but, you know, we, uh, we danced with jokes or something.
i didn't think so detail.
don't you think you should go out with someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i defaced a hard book to find a picture of saddam disappointment in the bathroom suite.
"what would saddam do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's just like our fire escape.
in prison, george sr. was preparing his evening with his most devoted fan.
at the time that gandi lightballoon was preparing for their own
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael was still angry at gob... while he went looking for the family expert to create trouble.
i know you dated shannon.
that cheerleader?
yeah, he'll probably take her to one of those stupid different dances
i wish i could bring someone surprising everyone.
you know, i actually called mr daniels and asked him... but he was breathing and he dropped the phone.
i never heard back.
you know, maybe we should both go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hello.
my mother took him.
he makes me register him at school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss michael and george michael's condition.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're into her.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
but i enjoyed spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality...
see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's like she's in love with you, so...
he knows we're out.
i told her you slept with my brother.
this could be the most unethical thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been a semester.
look, that was preemptive.
my brother was gonna try to sleep with you.
then i want to leave you right now and i won't come back.
i understand.
from now on.
george sr. went on a walk with cindi.
george.
and she started to know him.
you can totally spill your guts to me here.
it weights my soul.
you, you...
she's picking up the camera
i'm taking her to the grandmother dance, this is your dinner, so she's away with mom.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy
watch your back, my immigration little brother!
and spring dancing was in the final pace.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you don't let him in because he doesn't have your perfectly shaped nose, your round eye-shaped eyes, your strong square jaw.
you wanna dance?
all right!
finally found shannon gob called...
gobun found out he was cheating on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i ruined our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about it a lot, and-and... and
that's... that's your right thing.
george michael michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing at a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, my ethics teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
i'm really touched that you're trying to protect me after i've been so horrible to you.
in fact, gob mistook the ethics teacher michael was dating.
man, he's got this... type.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a civics teacher.
second movement.
i was seeing mrs. baerly, and i should never have drag in on this.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed at some sad things, but...
i don't think we have a future.
and, jeremy, i'll take that cake.
hey, you wanna dance?
i can't believe this is working.
on the next arrested development.
buster's competition heats up.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
the candle is forbidden here.
mom would freak.
no, it's okay.
i light my own candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna
you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you with these?
no problem.
right here, let me help you.
these?
okay, here, let me carry it for you.
yeah.

what you're suggesting, connie, is really, really,
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die
we'll all go one day, won't we?
four months ago, each of you attended a interview, to attend a never-before-seen tv show.
and guess what?
you win.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm totally gay, and i'm proud of
you're sweet, aren't you
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel, from england.
me too.
he's my brother stanton, my probation officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him in the head.
he doesn't know
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they say barack obama these days.
each of you will earn $00,000, all you have to do is spend one night in this prison.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
damn you!!
cool.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know if this is a prank?
right.
it's our third show, but we're not gonna publish until the fall.
you're gonna have to play and earn the money to figure out if this is a prank, right?
you will be asked to perform a series of tasks.
the tasks will force your borders, your courage and your thought.
sounds fun, doesn't it?
what kind of task are these, man?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
sign where?
i didn't have a girlfriend who'd even admit that when
i have to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
go around.
you'll notice.
the total money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if you all make it through the night, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can spend the night here for me.
anybody else wanna join him?
not me.
i can't possibly go all the way to the city with this
i'm in
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him
bye.
you guys are idiots.
it's a damn party joke, you're all gonna get high.
you're nothing but a bunch of idiots.
can't you see this is a recording party?
or we'll be famous.
there's a human head in there!
don't worry, it's not
it seems pretty real to me.
that's why they call it special effects.
lovely, isn't it
a little sign of what's waiting for you in there.
thanks to our bounty special effects team.
follow me, fellas.
in the warm-water, lazy crocodiles wait for their prey.
the indian crocodiles are long and benek-faced
such crocodiles...

i see you're working hard as usual.
ready?
we're all set
and absolutely.
keep it up.
yes, sir.
hi.
great job, you scaring them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are gonna do the show.
you really looked like you were terrified.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really creeps me out.
did you know that?
dead homeless people?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
it must be a big coincidence.
do you really think it's safe there?
safe enough for the show to be insured.
any more questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're filming.
all of you have chosen in your own free will to spend the night in jail and earn $00,000 each.
fair enough, isn't it?
okay, let the party begin.
you can find everything you need in your base camp, that's the principal's office.
where?
it's compl
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you've taken all our shirts, how can we write?
go down the hall, turn right, right again, then left.
straight up the stairs, left, right, and one more left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
there you will find a key to get rid of your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll have to wait and see.
i thought leaving the basement was scary.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to the mission.
can you please not do that?
i don't see shit here.
does anyone remember where we're going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, two rights, then left.
too many straight walks.
no, go straight down the hall, down the hall,
" turn around, make it right again, and left.
"then straight up the stairs, then down the stairs
"sola, right, and left again."
what are you?
smart.
illet, this is gonna be a great show
careful.
careful.
jesus.
what is this place?
and be ready.
it was fun.
let's speed them up a little
okay, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
damn it.
i don't
the power's running low, the generator should have come in already.
damn it!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here
it's freezing in here
look, key.
yeah.
okay.
guys, look.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think it's the ward
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what, man?
"hello, brave contestants.
"welcome to warden clem harvis' office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room
"this chess pieces will determine your personal role.
"you cannot trade with other contestants.
"the razors were her favorite".
"now it's your turn to put your hand in the box."
shit.
so, who wants first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't
what do you mean you don't know
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black rook.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
damn you!!
that was really bitchy.
my little piggies, welcome to the mission.
now let me tell you about the pennyville state prison.
in 0000, with the climbing costs increased in 0000, the ruthless warden decided to increase his fortune by eliminating certain expenses.
they were prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the director's crimes were released.
last time anyone here was sentenced to death was director harvis himself.
rumor has it the manager's still walking down the halls.
you will be asked to face the warden tonight and this building with tortured souls.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
does anyone want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the prison chapel to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first hallway.
sounds great.
thanks.
damn it!
what happened?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, relax, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they've hanged babies!
children... children...
i think they've got it covered with speakers.
voices are more efficient than image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
god!
that sounds lovely.
no, i'm fine, man.
wacko.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't
there's a sound
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're using speakers, randall.
really.
okay.
my... my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flashlight.
okay, now?
open the bible marked page...
"where you will find the lord's prayer.
"there has been disrespect for this place 00 years ago,
"now this is the room of unusual events."
my... "in reverse."
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit
i can't do
"when you complete your mission...
"if there's no sign of the warden,
you can go back to camp.
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry, whoever i'm bothering
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
"evil us from evil...
"our father who art in heaven...
"do not let evil lead us.
"and keep us from over...
"forgive us our debts as we forgive those who owe us.
"and our daily bread gives us today.
"as it is in heaven...
"like on the sky,
"for thy kingdom and rule is yours."
please tell me i can go now.
"before i head for camp"
jesus, randall, you have to blow out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look what they're made for money
where'd he go?
i understand the guys who did this job cut our connection to our homo friend to give us a scarier air.
whatever.
absolutely, it went quite well.
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, dude, it's not that bad.
it's definitely not worth the
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm done.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it
they can serve you again.
don't joke
i swear, you don't even know how you feel there.
it's like you're walking through heavy fog, just as cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated
let's get scelzi to go downstairs and have a look, you fix it.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy
either we talk or i walk or i walk or
it's important to me too, taylor
what do you mean?
i had a little research done.
you mean the local girl you were sleeping with?
am i right?
big lips, wide hips, taylor.
okay, so prison wasn't just for men
women have division?
and that damn crazy principal would roam around the women's ward and not answer anybody.
beat them, rape them, get pregnant, and starve them.
they say he fed some of them their own babies.
what do you mean?
what do i mean?
this is a real story that will increase interest in the show!
everyone could be talking about us.
that's the story you made up compared to the truth, nothing.
i think so.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do that, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
really?
what is it?
anyway, i'm going to get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they are.
good.
scelzi, what is it?
it's just a little something to keep me out the night.
want some?
just get your hairy ass over here, okay?
aye, aye
hello?
you scared the shit out of me.
i've got some good stuff.
suit yourself.
we're totally ready to begin
i'd say my biggest fear was being buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will lead you to freedom."
okay,
i am at the end of freedom.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
damn you!!
what?
blood.
it's not real
no curses, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs are going upstairs, not down.
i'm sorry
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down, you'll see a door with fingers
he says...
damn it!
"welcome to prison number five.
"for the violent and insan madness,
shit.
tell me what i need to do... get the hell out of here.
no!
thanks.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
it says, "if an inmate fails suicide, fails,
"you will now live a sentence for a prisoner."
okay, where's the
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult mission.
you'll be told what you'll do when you're
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my duty.
connie.
what?
check this out.
what?
it can't
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back, and i specifically told you, you added something to the show, and you ask why you were fired?
this is not our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't
don't look at me.
look, connie, you have to get that guy out, okay?
she's gonna screw
damn it!
we'll be screwed
you didn't bring this?
cut it out no.
it's obvious
what's so obvious?
come closer.
i asked why you put cameras in the control room.
yeah.
behind-scan images they wanted to record...
holy cow!
holy cow!
you're right.
genius, isn't it
absolutely brilliant.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company's trying to scare us from putting something into the show, how it scares us?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black king and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you could do another mission.
smartass.
okay, black king and white horse turn right and go to the gas chamber.
white queen and black rook are going straight, and they're going to prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"king and knight go left and then right.
"rok and horse go all the way to the end of the hall
"and come down the stairs".
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, pick up.
we're in.
"welcome to the gathering room.
there must be a light on the wall behind you, turn it on.
"black king and white horse enter the gas chamber".
nice set, connie.
she deserved the best there, it's a real place.
it's the only place the legal department clean
beautiful, isn't it
pretty scary.
jesus.
what is that smell?
a documented fact chamber of execution usually carries the smell of death.
of course, the smell isn't actually
when a man knows that his life has come to an end, his worry has come to the end, it's causing him to emit a lot of stink.
in this case, it's the smell of the human smell we're breathing and the gas that killed him.
now's the fun time, ladies and
black king gets to the chair.
black king?
that would be me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you will find some meat and a pan.
"this is to be cooked and eaten".
man!
prisoners are always nerd pigs, pigs...
"or there's no lamb and there's no other flesh
"that they suspected.
"they thought they'd never tasted before, sweet meat."
you mean human flesh, don't you?
are you in there?
yeah.
guess what you'll do now?
i give up.
you'll tie toni up.
i'm transferring to you from here, and toni should fully experience the fear of the prisoners immediately before the gas was gassed
you're good at this.
let's just say there were some of my girlfriends' strange wishes.
you okay?
okay.
"your task as your gase teammate...
"before it kills the main valve and cut gas."
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to throw up.
okay.
strange.
i can't do
i can't
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just the show.
"no more prank."
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they'll pay you extra money."
do it for the team, girl.
are you gonna throw up?
thanks.
okay, angel, i'm at the bottom of the stairs.
damn it!!
can you hear me?
he's back
it really stinks.
let me out.
come on.
get me out, man.
god!
who's that guy standing there?
topless.
muscular.
let me out.
i don't know, con. this guy started creeping me out
stop playing games.
let me out.
how's it going
we need to talk to you.
outside?
yeah.

rain?
london control, the package should have been in cia custody 00 minutes ago.
our aircraft is waiting.
it's a good thing our guest isn't in a
the traffic tower says they'll be moving in five minutes.
the home office closets are blown out.
we're gonna have to be a little more creative about our funding.
where the hell is oliver?
where's the air cover?
you can break the rules, but you need a private order.
something must be done.
director general.
i know you don't like hearing this from a politician, but reform is coming.
do you know that elevator was just for emergencies?
escort two, what's your status?
are you uneasy, juney?
if you just keep being my london girlfriend, you'll get less.
that position won't last long.
i spy with my little eye something beginning with the letter...
engines, they're speeding up.
put them on screen.
calum, nearest police units?
whatever we have, come on.
code 0! code

lead two, report.
ed, wait.
lead two, report.
i repeat, the cia liaison officer has been shot.
lead two, do you see qasim?
control, i heard a vehicle.
they've shut everything down.
it's over
the bbc can confirm that the american terrorist leader adem qasim has escaped from mi0 custody in one of the most serious failures in the organisation's
it appears the security convoy transporting qasim was attacked in the raf northolt route.
because it's in the west streets, you call it not war, murder
because you didn't want it in new york, washington, london.
but the children of pakistan also did not want them.
when they get hit by drone aircraft, they call it murder.
qasim presents a new kind of threat.
so far, he hasn't targeted civil
our models show a 00% chance of attack within 00 hours.
the more pressure it gets under, the smaller the window.
i can't say that when i'm recording the tape
the secretary of state arrives tomorrow
we serve the british people, not washington.
if that's not true, we're already done.
the americans think we no longer serve purpose.
we need a head.
i'll be relieved of duty
you didn't hear anything about qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, what's gonna happen to me
you get out.
no one else knows that qasim is in his web.
just get out.
will holloway?
drive.
how's life after mi0?
you're not from the moscow division.
you need london.
anyone you need to say goodbye to?
thank you.
we know about harry's connection to your family, so we understand this may not be easy for you.
even if he's dead, it'
harry's too arrogant to kill himself.
he was just acting like he was gonna kill himself.
he went to her grave.
the love of your life
harry's team has noticed a change in harry's behavior since she died.
emotionally distant, cold, started drinking heavily.
water would be below nine degrees.
he used to have hypothermia before reaching the bank.
this is a picture before you went ashore, and this is a picture you said after you jumped.
before she disappeared, harry made three encrypted phone calls.
your old emergency message box.
why did she call you?
i have no idea.
last time i spoke to him was the last time he took me from mi0 three years ago.
she wants to talk right now.
that makes you useful.
can you help us find him?
no, thanks.
and harry, do you talk a lot about berlin?
the night your father died?
if there's anything else, mace, i have a right to know.
i don't think i can decide that...
if you're not really going to kill him, i think you meant to.
find harry, so you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
i thought i'd take that title to the grave.
recently, head of counter-terrorism for his majesty's security services.
funny, but who are you really?
someone who knows what these two words mean to you.
asma shishani.
go.
how did you find me?
what do you want?
i know it was someone on my side.
they never told me who they were.
of course not, but you must have a contact.
a phone number, that's all.
phone number works, too.
in return, i'll give you what you want.
impossible.
he said he was a human rights lawyer.
your government helped two of my brothers after they were imprisoned.
but after i was released, she became too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if she's a spy, she's not
and if it doesn't matter, just say it's not worth anything to you.
keep her alive, she's guaranteed to keep my word.
i don't need guarantees.
get her to a hospital now or the deal's off!
what she needs is mercy.
no!
she has a daughter.
and you sent her after me?
you put him in danger and now you refuse to save him from pain?
how the fuck are you?
don't send a video to her family.
harry... harry
you have a deal.
according to the bbc, there is no breakthrough in the hunt for escaped terrorist adem qasim.
the national threat level has reached critical level, so there's an attack on her ear.
in economics news, the ftse 000 fell again this morning and sterling continued to breathe the dollar, the euro and other departments.
there's a new intel on harry.
he's got a brand-educated line we tracked down to kent coast.
holloway, this is classified information.
we found traces of explosives there.
you've known him longer than any of us.
do you think it's possible that qasim would somehow have harry involved?
lure him in?
i don't
anyway, you find harry, we find qasim.
anything for holloway?
here.
tomorrow, 00.
slop 0, roll a, bay one.
then, open your eyes.
i hope you come alone.
only for protection.
if you can't get a crazy cold war morale without shooting him, we're in serious trouble.
i don't promise.
it says not yet.
we play this harry's way until we see him.
understood.
doors opening.
drive.
floor.
doors opening.
open sightings, multiple exits.
repeat, holloway.
things harry needed for a meeting adjustment.
yes, mr holloway, your uncle said he'd meet you at the coffee shop.
she left her cell phone at home.
the guy in the parking lot, get rid of him
he'd be wearing an mi0 t-shirt.
listen to me.
stop underestimating harry.
don't think you'll endanger your men.
wait for the signal to send...
what happened, alpha 0?
holloway?
holloway, where are you going?
wait.
no, we're not set up there.
freeze.
holloway, freeze!
terminal 0b.
doors closing.
he booked me a flight.
pa000 to glasgow.
i'm going to glasgow.
call the glasgow office.
get me the airport police.
priority code sigma nine.
the police want a clear path to the terminal.
and get us permission to secure heathrow.
the passengers on flight to glasgow glasgow...
holloway, do not go airborne.
what am i doing here, harry?
i had to find someone i could trust outside the service.
it's a short list when you leave drunk, mad and dead.
to be honest, the only person i can call a friend is someone who thinks i ruined her life.
qasim's escape was arranged by someone at the top of the service.
by one of the people who asked you to follow me.
that's why i had to disappear.
you had qasim.
he's our only connection to the traitor
once he's in the system, he'll be
he's planning an attack.
someone's trying to destroy the service itself.
you're crazy.
ruth's death...
don't
look for yourself, that's all i want.
what are you waiting for, harry?
mi0 was everything to me and you took it from me, for nothing.
hate me all you want, but i think you believe in the service.
what happened in berlin?
is that how they tricked you?
this may not be the end you hope for.
i'm afraid i have to tell them there's something in the lining of your jack
nothing there of course, but they'll have to check it out.
i'll send you a number.
call me in 00 hours, please.
i'm security services.
hands behind your back!
you just let her go.
calm down, francis.
we don't want you to have a heart
the deadly one.
mi0 looks like a complete liability right now, and i'm the last friend in the government of mi0.
so you need to be really nice to me right now.
in other words, is he nuts?
that doesn't contradict his last three psych evaluations
she refused to attend.
he didn't stop being harry pearce.
as crazy as he is, i'll still catch him...
for instance.
she asked me to help her disappear.
don't you think you'd agree and bring her to us?
just because your life hasn't been worth shit since harry fired you don't think we can't put your life in a shitty position.
since we're threatening each other, the three of you haven't been hanging on a cliff or anything.
your entire organization seems to be disabled right now.
find qasim.
fully loaded.
they're ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i saw that name working on a case.
i thought they put you off duty.
they did.
now, what really happened?
the abduction may have been set up by someone in the service.
you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i just quit three weeks ago.
there must be one around here.
tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't apply
when i was 00 years old, i was hanging out with a guy who makes the cash transfer.
the k section was interested in some people using it, so they came to me.
you started as an agent?
and when i was done, they wanted me to train as an officer.
my family came back when i told them.
and if someone you worked with helped get away with qasim, that would be a problem, wouldn't it?
all right.
something felt wrong that day.
rob vass, my team leader, he was in the lead car with me.
he told me not to open the weapons compartment.
he ordered me not to pursue.
where does he live?
it's
w00 account front.
panama city.
service bribery fund.
june, what are you...
