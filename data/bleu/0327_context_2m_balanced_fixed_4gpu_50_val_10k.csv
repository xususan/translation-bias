michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, her brother, buster, shared her bed.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's fit for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i'll tell him.
i have to write an article on the moral side of the war... and the fact that a conflict can be avoided... at least 000 words.
i'm not sure our vice teacher would like me to cheat while writing a trial.
so, you passed my moral test.
actually, it was desperate for your teacher, desperate, to have a cruel and abe ingeichael bethbaerlyad.
even the hands of people who commit small crimes can be brutally chopped off.
no ring no ring no ring ring no ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
the s.d.k.'s eye was on us.
your father thought it would make us look better.
he must have faked my signature.
"maybe a year ago, i'll have a son who's done with the cheese!
you have to save me from this.
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't look at him either.
i no longer have the compassion and milk of a mother.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm sending you an olive branch here.
yeah-yeah.
by the way, when did you sleep with someone?
meanwhile, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
i'm telling you why.
i guess there's some things you can't tell your father about.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set up his teacher... to help him fulfill his motherhood.
there's nothing wrong with that.
but i still have to tell you that i'm a little broken by not thinking about it.
the halos can carry out this mission.
teachers can do that job.
sure, someday, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall, right across from you.
lindsay had never been so proud of what she said her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i've been telling you about.
girl, really... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
you have a mustache.
i mean, the mustache has milk on it.
yeah.
but gob mistook michael's kindness for sentimentality... and feels like he was competition to get involved.
because, you know, she's beyond adorable... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
[ nazhgalia, michael, shannon] really?
and george sr was on his way to a surprise visit.
i read all your teachings and took all your tapes.
and i watched it all over again.
george s.r. had recently invented a series of tapes he'd recommend to people... to make money out of the spirituality he'd just discovered.
i also lost two kilos of your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to learn.
this is a good place to start.
and after michael got rid of the two girls he had an appointment with, he met lindsay at parents' night.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this place have the same floor plan as our kitchen floor?
i think she's really good for you.
i thought it would make the motherhood think.
besides, i can't just rush into something like this because my son wants me to, and marry somebody.
i'm miss baerly, the vice teacher.
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life... that could be destroyed by a reckless pull of the trigger.
and michael got to know his son's morality teacher.
that's the "rrrr" thing.
you know, it's very annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you were laughing.
"rrrr!" - "rrrr!"
but, you know, she's...
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a question for you.
a parent teacher can ask for a drink?
or... or... or... or... or
yeah, he's dead.
well, i guess since this incident with mr. daniels having a stroke...
let's go get a drink.
yeah, maybe it'll help.
george scr was dealing with his own fan.
i've already told you all of my sins.
maybe you could tell me some of your sins.
well, there are legal symptoms showing my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me about one of those things... that happened at the university bedroom again.
and what is it that michael's meeting with miss bayerly on the second date today...
michael, this little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with him.
at least, i think it's him.
you'd have to rob her for nothing.
yes, mother.
they'll take him back.
don't take your shoes off, little man.!
don't take your shoes off!
he's out of control.
who is it?
this is annyong, your father and i adopted it.
what, i'm leaving for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille figured buster was concerned, even jealous.
and he understood how it felt to be ignored.
annyyong is your sister's now your sister's a
cancel.
it stays.
listen, i'll call you back.
nice driving.
you making dinner reservations?
he made a "safe korean."
and after the dates...
michael took a step he hadn't taken in years.
well, do you think this is a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we sneak in without waking everyone up?
this may not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i love.
so i took someone you love.
i said'nashbagerblairjam'
listen, i know you're trying to get revenge on the marta incident.
i was lying to you when i said i wouldn't try to sleep with her, so...
he has to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i'm lucky i got rid of him.
no problem.
so romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden"?
hi, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i need to tell you i don't know if it's real first.
but now... your morality teacher...
yeah, i did it for her.
oh.
she loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm sure you're interested in her on the subject.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i just wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
about the class?
i mean, i'm saying that she loves him... to my loyalty...
hi, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with him.
well, why did he do that?
why did he sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new...
he's not one of the good shooters who's targeting him, and he's practically shooting everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think she's old?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
she was on the different dance... and i was thinking about going to her, going to her, and, you know, doing things...
"hey, do you wanna dance?"
and she's like, i thought she'd say, "what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did different in front of the mirror, but...
but, you know, it's, uh, we were dancing with a joke or something.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should go out with your own age?
like your cousin.
i've proven a book that's hard to find a picture of saddam's bath suite.
"what would sadame do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know anything?
okay, that's exactly like our fire escape.
in prison, george sr. was getting ready to spend the evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon was preparing for himself.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael was still mad at gob... looking for a family expert on making trouble for him.
i know you went out with shannon.
that cheerleader?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different dances.
i wish i could bring someone to shock everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and asked him... but he was breathing, and he dropped the phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe we should both go.
right, i mean, a bad example...
hello.
my mother took him.
he's making me sign him up for the school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the situation with miss bearly and george michael.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
so, you're interested in her.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality...
see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's, like, in love with you, so...
she knows we're out.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most unethical thing i've ever heard in my life.
well, you've only been a semester for half a semester.
look, it was a preemptive move.
my brother was gonna try to sleep with you.
well, i want to leave you right now, and i'm not going back to you.
i see.
starting now.
he went for a walk with george sr. cindi.
george.
and she got to know him.
you can totally spill yourself in me here.
it's weighting on my soul.
you...
he's picking up the camera.
so, this is your dinner, which is far away with mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong man.
watch your back, my immigration little brother!
and the different spring dance was at the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
so you don't let her in just because she doesn't have the flawless, flawless, flawless nose, like you.
you wanna dance?
all right!
gob finally found shannon he was looking for...
he found out that gob had cheated on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hi, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i messed up our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about it for a long time, and-and...
that's... that's what you mean by the right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing at a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yes, with my moral teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my moral teacher.
after being so mean to you, trying to protect me really got to me.
actually, gob mistook michael's morality teacher... for citizenship teacher.
man, she... she understands.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a teacher of citizenship.
second move.
i was seeing mrs. baerly, and i never should have brought gob into it.
but the day you told me you liked him, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed on some sad things, but...
i don't think we have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm getting this cake.
hey, you wanna dance?
i can't believe this is working.
next arrested in development.
buster's pull is tough.
stop, stop, stop, stop!!!!!!!!!!
it's forbidden to have candles here.
mom's going crazy.
no, it's okay.
i light my candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
do you want me to help you carry these?
no problem.
right here, let me help you.
these?
okay, here, let me carry it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're offering, connie, is something really, really extreme.
too much.
come on!
come on!
ok!
ok!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we'll all go one day, right?
four months ago, each of you joined a interview to join the never-before-seen tv show.
and guess what?
you won.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm a total homosexual, and i'm proud of it.
that's sweet, isn't it?
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel, from england.
me too.
he's my brother stanton, my parole officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him on the head.
she doesn't know.
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they're like barack obama these days.
each of you will make $00,000.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
fuck!
cool.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know it's not a prank?
right.
actually, this is our third show, but we're not gonna run until the fall.
to see if this is a prank, you're gonna have to play the game and earn the money.
you will be asked to perform a series of missions.
the missions will force your boundaries, your courage and your thinking.
that sounds fun, right?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where am i signing?
i didn't have a girlfriend to admit it when she was high.
i have to look after my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
come around.
you'll notice.
the total money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if you all get the night out, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can spend the night here.
anyone else want to join him?
not me.
there's no way i'm going all the way to the city with this piss boy from
i'm in.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you guys are idiots.
it's a fucking party joke, they're gonna fuck you all up.
you don't look like a bunch of idiots.
can't you see this is a recording party?
or get famous.
there's a human head there!
don't worry, it's not real.
it seemed pretty real to me.
that's why they call us special effects.
isn't it lovely?
a little sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thanks to our bounty special effects team.
follow me, fellas.
in the hot swampwater, lazy crocodiles are waiting for their prey.
the indian crocodiles become long and spotted faces.
such gators...
guys.
i see you're working hard as usual.
ready?
we're all set.
and totally.
keep it up.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great that you scared them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are joining the show.
you really looked like you were terrified.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, looking at this place really gives me the creeps.
did you know that?
the dead homeless?
sure.
why didn't you say anything?
that must be a big coincidence.
you really think it's safe there?
it's safe enough for the insurance on the show.
any more questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're recording.
each of you has been chosen by your own free will to spend the night in jail to gain $00,000.
it's obvious, isn't it?
okay, let's get this party started.
you can find anything you need at your base camp, that's the manager's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you took everything we had, so how can we write it?
go down the hall, turn right, right, right, then left.
straight up the stairs, left, right, and another left.
do you want me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
there you will find a key to get rid of your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought leaving the basement was awful.
have fun, inmates.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to duty.
can you not do that?
i can't see a damn thing here.
anyone remember where we were going?
go flat, right, then left.
no go straight, two right, then left.
there was so much going on.
no, go straight down the hall, down the hall,
"go back to the left, do it right again, and left.
"and then straight down the stairs,
"sola, right, and left again."
what are you?
smart.
illet, it's gonna be a great show.
careful.
careful.
jesus.
what is this place?
and be ready.
it was fun.
let's speed them up.
yes, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
the power's going down, the generator should have come in.
damn it!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's freezing here.
look, the key.
yeah.
okay.
look, people.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think so, director.
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what, man?
"hey, brave contestants.
"welcome to warden clem harvis' office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room.
"the chess pieces will determine your own personal role.
"you can't trade with the other contestants.
"the rails were her favourite."
"now it's your turn to put your hand in the box".
shit.
well, who wants first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black hawk.
black rook.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
fuck!
that was really crazy.
welcome to my little piggies, mission.
now let me tell you about the pennyville state prison.
in 0000, with the cost in 0000, the cruel warden decided to increase his fortune by destroying some of his expenses.
they were prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the warden's crimes were revealed.
the last person here to be executed on death penalty was principal harvis himself.
rumor has it the director was still walking through the halls.
you will be asked to face the principal tonight and the tortured souls under this building.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
does anyone want to change?
no!
okay.
"the white queen has to go to the prison church to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first hallway.
that sounds awesome.
thank you.
damn it!
what happened?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, take it easy, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung the babies!
kids...
i think they put it all on speakerphone.
the voices are more effective than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
jesus!
that sounds great.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
i heard something.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're making noise from the speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn your flashlight off.
okay now?
open the sign page from the bible...
"you will find the lord's prayer there.
"there has been disrespect for this place that was sacred 00 years ago,
"now this is the center of extraordinary events."
oh, "the opposite."
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do that.
"when you complete your mission...
"if there's no sign of the director,
"you can go back to camp."
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry about who i'm bothering.
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
" protect us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"do not let evil rule us.
"and do not overcome us...
"as we forgive those who owe us, forgive us our debts.
"give us our daily bread today.
"as in heaven...
"as in the sky,
"because rule and rule is yours."
please tell me i can go now.
"before i go camping,"
jesus, randall, you need to blow out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look at the money made.
where'd she go?
from what i understand, the people who did this job had cut off our connection to our homo friend for a more creepy weather.
whatever.
definitely, like, clogged.
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, dude, it's not that bad.
definitely not worth the money.
but fulfilling the mission was worth money.
thank god i'm done.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it again.
they can assign you back.
no kidding.
i swear you don't even know how people feel in there.
it's like walking through a busy fog, only as cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go to the next one.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated.
let's get scelzi down and have a look, you'll be ten.
scelzi.
yeah.
i need you to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
either we talk or i'll go or i'll talk or i
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i had a little research done.
and by "don't" you mean the town girls you sleep with?
am i right?
big lips, big hips, taylor.
okay, the prison isn't just for the men, is it?
there were any women in the department?
and the goddamn crazy manager would walk around the women's division naked and never answer to anyone.
beat them, rape them, get them pregnant, and starve to death.
some people say he's been feeding their own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this true story's gonna make the show more interesting!
anyone could be talking about us.
that story you made up is nothing compared to the truth.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do this, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
really?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they do.
good.
scelzi, what is that?
just a little something to get me through the night.
want some?
get your hairy ass here right now, okay?
aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the hell out of me.
i've got a great stuff here.
suit yourself.
we're totally ready to start.
i can tell you my biggest fear is being buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will bring you freedom here".
okay,
i'm at the end of freedom.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
fuck!
what?
blood.
not real blood.
no swears, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs are not down, but upstairs.
i'm sorry.
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down there, you're gonna see a finger door.
he says...
damn it!
welcome to cell number five.
"if we think of the violence and the madness and the violence,
shit.
tell me what to do... and i'll get out of this hell.
no!
thank you.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
she says, " if a prisoner can't commit suicide, if a prisoner can't,
"you will now live the punishment sent to a prisoner."
okay, where's the pit?
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult mission.
"what are you gonna do when you're in the hole."
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my job.
connie.
what?
look at this.
what?
no... no...
you're fired.
why?
you go behind my back and you hire something to add to the show, and you ask me why you were fired?
this is not our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you have to take that guy out, okay?
he's gonna ruin the show.
damn it!
we'll be ruined.
so you didn't bring this?
cut it out, no.
it's obvious.
what's open?
come closer.
i asked you why you were putting a camera in the control room.
yeah.
camera footage... they want to record...
wow!
wow!
you're right.
genius, right?
totally genius.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to record how you scare us by putting things into the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll go on with the show.
as planned.
three.
black and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you there'd be a mission again.
smartass.
okay, black king and white horse turn right and go to the gas chamber.
the white queen and the black horse keep up, and they go to the prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"the hawk and horse go left and then right.
"come and ride to the end of the hallway,
"and get down the stairs".
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, open it.
we're in.
"welcome to the gathering room.
there must be a light in the wall behind you, turn it on.
"black king and white horse go into the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
it deserved the best, it's a real place.
the only place the legal department has ever cleared.
isn't it beautiful?
pretty scary.
jesus.
what's that smell?
a documented fact of execution rooms often carry the smell of death itself.
of course, the smell is not death.
if a man knows his last moments of his life, his anxiety over the course is caused by an epidemic which gives him plenty of smell.
in this case, the smell of the human smell that we breathe now and the gas that killed him is the smell.
now for fun, ladies and gentlemen.
the black witness is sitting in the chair.
black person?
that would be me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you'll find some meat and a pan.
"you'll cook and eat this meat."
man!
the prisoners who have always eaten meat cow, pig...
"or whether it's not a lamb or a meat...
"they suspected it would happen.
"they thought it was a pleasant meat they never tasted before."
you mean human flesh, right?
are you in?
yeah.
guess what now?
i gave up.
you'll tie toni up.
i'm telling you, toni should fully experience the fear of the previous prisoners before the gas is given.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends have weird wishes.
are you okay?
okay.
"your job gas teammate...
"lead to find the main van and cut the gas."
you should watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 you'll throw up.
okay.
strange.
i can't do that.
i can't.
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
"no more silly jokes anymore."
remember what you said?
"if team wins, they'll pay the extra money."
do it for the team, girl.
are you gonna throw up?
thank you.
okay, angel, i'm at the bottom of the stairs.
fuck!
can you hear me?
he's back.
it really stinks.
let me out.
come on.
get me out, man.
jesus!
who's that guy standing there?
topless.
muscular.
let me out.
i don't know, con, this guy's starting to creep me out.
stop playing games.
let me out.
how's it going?
we need to talk to you.
outside?
yeah.
i have some big news.
i think the company's playing us.
what?
who's there?
who are you?
show me the gas chamber.
and what do we do with the castle teller?
where are they?
i don't know, just give me a few seconds.
there.
did you see that man again?
wow!
who's that?
okay, how could she have got here so fast?
isn't that the guy in the picture?
yeah.
yeah, she looks like him.
nice.
no, not cool at all.
this guy either gets through the walls, or there's more than one man.
we've all been watching "prtij"?
do you mind if we pass?
please?
guys?
guys?
fake blood, fake.
they did good.
maybe even oscar.
no.
no, that's not true.
it's completely out of scenario.
sounds real to me.
connie, they're playing us.
trust me.
what?
look.
they copied the picture.
what?
acting.
clothes.
easy.
wait.
no.
no.
he's a real ghost.
i can't translate any more.
if it goes any further, it'll be out of sight.
what?
this is a big prison.
i can't put cameras everywhere.
show me the pit.
show me the gas chamber.
taylor, somebody better go over there and see if they're okay.
i can tell they don't look good.
he's acting.
then where's scelzi?
i don't know.
probably hiding somewhere.
i'll call the office.
okay, you too.
good night.
they don't know what's going on.
i feel bad.
okay, i'll go and prove it to you.
no problem.
anyone coming?
i'm coming.
i'll get my camera, see if i can get some good footage.
thank you.
you have to be nice to them.
you'll make it snappy!
you're gonna be okay.
you know what?
you really are photogenic.
you're funny, kid.
i want to do my job now.
lock the air.
come on.
connie, what do you want to do?
stop the game.
wow, this place looks haunted, doesn't it?
it gets a little weird.
where did he go?
i don't know.
i didn't see him.
it's headed this way.
not here.
what was that?
yeah, what was that?
shit.
taylor?
put angel on screen.
we have to get them out of there.
can you hear me?
listen to me.
there's been a change of plans.
we have to stop the show.
what?
why?
i'll be honest with you.
there's one more person with you.
who?
we're not sure.
i want you to get out of there as fast as possible, okay?
are you playing games with me?
you're trying to scare me.
open the door.
i want to win and get my money.
open this door!
who opened the door?
sorry, you're not serious, are you?
idiot!
your job is to memorize and locate the cell seven that are marked.
lucky!
in this cell, warden harvis was injured deadly by a prisoner.
you'll find a key in that cell, this key will free your friend from the pit and the gas chamber.
great.
was that all?
it was the easiest money i've ever made.
what am i scared of?
nothing.
angel!
stanton?
help!
good, now he's out of my sight.
hello?
who's there?
hello?
angel?
angel.
let me down.
who are you?
angel?
angel!
what... what... what... what...
it's not real.
let me down.
wait.
it's you.
no!
angel, are you okay?
he killed my brother.
he'll kill me too.
he killed my brother.
new jersey school of acting.
not bad for someone like me, is it?
connie, are you there?
yeah.
how could you organize this?
we've had a hard time.
it's gonna be a great show.
i'll see you later.
let me get this shit out first, okay?
you're such an asshole.
you said you wanted a great show, didn't you?
you got what you wanted.
yeah.
untie sei, i'll take dixon and stanton.
okay, snow, we're cutting it.
guys, get cleaned up and change.
prepare for popi and champagne.
excellent acting.
show's over.
toni?
good job, dixon.
okay, dixon.
it's over, man.
are you okay?
stop playing, snow.
you wanna say something?
we have to get them out of there.
we have to get them out of there.
get it out of my face!

i spy with my little eye beginning with the y.
if you can't understand, you'll lose as a punishment.

london, the package was supposed to be in cia custody 00 minutes ago.
our aircraft is waiting.
it's a good thing our guest wasn't in a hurry.

the home office cupboards are open.
we're gonna have to be a little more creative about our funding.
where the hell is oliver?
where's the plane protection?
you can break the rules, but you need a special order.
something must be done.
director general.
i know you don't like hearing this from a politician, but reform is coming.
do you know that elevator is just for emergencies?
guard 0, what's your status?
are you uneasy, juney?
you'd be less uptight if you just kept being my london girlfriend.
that position won't be open for long.
i spy with my little eye beginning with that letter...
engines are going for the final speed.
put them on the screen.
calum, nearest police units?
whatever we have, come on.
code 0!
attack is happening!
jesus.
june, for god's sake, don't.
get out, now!
it was allowed to use deadly power.

open the van, now!

americans will crucify us.
your operation, harry.
say again, central command?
lower your weapons and release qasim.
what the fuck are you doing, harry?
open the gates!
open the gates!
come on, come on, come on!
control, the prisoner has escaped!
head north!
no, no!
keaton!
the command center is chasing agent two on foot.
any other images?
follow her.
the nearest armed unit is five minutes away.
the helicopter's 00 miles away.
barriers?
in position.
the other side of the tunnel is the last intersection.
they have nowhere to go.
sco00 is five minutes away.
move.
lead two, report.
ed, wait.
lead two, report.
repeat, the cia liaison officer has been shot.
agent 0, do you see qasim?
control, i heard a vehicle.
they shut everything down.
it's over.
the bbc can confirm that the us terrorist leader adam qasim has escaped from mi0 custody in one of the most serious mistakes in the history of the organization.
apparently, the security convoy transporting qasim was attacked on the shelf northolt route.
you call it murder, not war on the west side.
because in new york, in washington, you didn't want that in london.
but neither did pakistan's children.
when they get shot by drone airplanes, they call it murder.
qasim offers a new kind of threat.
so far, he hasn't targeted civilians.
our models show a 00% chance of attack within 00 hours.
the more pressure he gets, the smaller the window.
i can't say that with the tape record...
the foreign minister's coming tomorrow.
we serve the british people, not washington.
if that's not true, we're already done.
the americans think we no longer serve purpose.
we need a head.
i'll be suspended in the morning.
have you heard nothing about qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, what happens to me if you get out?
take it off with you.
nobody else knows you're in qasim's network.
just get out.
will holloway?
drive.
how's life after mi0?
you're not from the moscow branch.
london needs you.
is there anyone you should say goodbye to?
thank you.
we know about harry's connection to your family, so we understand this may not be easy for you.
even if he's dead, it's fine.
harry's too arrogant to kill himself.
he was acting like he was going to kill himself.
she went to her grave.
the love of your life.
harry's team has noticed changes in harry's attitude since the woman died.
she was emotionally distant, cold, started drinking a large amount of alcohol.
the water would be below 0 degrees.
he'd have hypothermia before he got to the bank.
this is the picture you told me you were taken after you jumped in before you entered this square.
before she disappeared, harry made two encrypted phone calls.
your old emergency message box.
why did she call you?
i have no idea.
the last time i spoke to him was when he picked me up from mi0 three years ago.
she wants to talk right now.
that makes you useful.
can you help us find him?
no, thanks.
and you, harry, do you talk a lot about berlin?
the night your father died?
if anything else, mace, i have a right to know.
i don't think i can make that...
if you're not really gonna kill him, i think you told him what you wanted to tell him.
find harry, so you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
i thought i was taking that title to the grave.
recently, she's head of anti-terrorism for her majesty's security service.
funny, but who are you really?
it's someone who knows what these two words mean to you.
asma shishani.
go.
how did you find me?
what do you want?
someone did it, i know.
they never told me who they were.
of course not, but you must have a connection.
a phone number, that's all.
the phone number'll work.
in return, i'll give you what you want.
impossible.
she said she was a human rights lawyer.
your government helped them after two of my brothers were in jail.
but after i was released, she became too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if she's a spy, she's not one of us.
then don't be a problem, but tell me again it's not worth anything to you.
keep her alive, she's the guarantee that i'll keep my promise.
i don't need guarantees.
take her to a hospital or the deal's off!
what she needs is mercy.
no!
she has a daughter.
and you sent her after me?
you put him in danger and now you refuse to spare him the pain?
what kind of man are you?
don't send the video to his family.
harry... harry... harry... harry...
you have a deal.
according to the bbc, no progress on the arrest of escaped terrorist adam qasim.
the national threat level is critical, so there's an attack on the hand tower.
in the news of the economy, the ftse 000 fell again this morning, and the sterlin, the dollar, the euros, and the rest of the money.
there's a new intel on harry.
he's got a convict we've tracked down to kent cast.
holloway, this is classified information.
we also found traces of explosives there.
you've known him longer than any of us.
do you think it's possible qasim somehow got harry involved?
pull him up?
i don't know.
anyway, you find harry, we find qasim.
anything for holloway?
here.
tomorrow at 00.
"shpa 0, row a, park at 0 a.
then, open your eyes.
i hope you come alone.
only for protection.
if you can't bring a crazy cold war mood without hitting it, we're really in trouble.
i promise.
it says not yet.
we're playing through harry's side until we see him.
copy that.
doors opening.
drive.
ground floor.
doors opening.
open sightings, multiple exits.
repeat, holloway.
what harry needed for a meeting to set up.
yes, mr. holloway, your uncle said he'd meet you at the coffee shop.
she left her cell phone at home.
the guy in the parking lot, get rid of him.
he'd be wearing an mi0 shirt.
listen to me.
stop underestimating harry.
don't think he'll put your men in danger.
wait for the signal...
what is it, alpha 0?
holloway?
holloway, where are you going?
wait.
no, we have no order there.
don't move.
holloway, freeze!
terminal 0b.
doors closing.
she booked me a flight.
pa000, the glow plane.
i'm going to douglasow.
call the douglasow office.
get me the airport police.
priority code sigma nine.
the police want a clear path to the terminal.
and get us clearance for heathrow security.
the passengers are...
holloway, don't go in the airfield.
what am i doing here, harry?
i had to find someone outside the service that i could trust.
it's a short list when you go drunk, crazy and dead.
to be honest, the only person i can say is someone who thinks i ruined your life.
qasim's escape was set up by someone at the very top of the service.
by one of the people who asked you to follow me.
that's why i had to get lost.
qasim had him.
he's our only connection to the traitor.
once it's in the system, it'll be silence.
he's planning an attack.
someone's trying to destroy themselves.
you're crazy.
ruth's death...
don't!
look, that's all i want.
what are you waiting for, harry?
mi0 was everything to me, and you took it from me, for nothing.
hate me all you like, but i think you believe in the service.
what happened in berlin?
did they fool you like that?
this might not end up like you expected.
i'm afraid i have to tell them there's something in the lining of your jacket.
nothing there, but they'll have to check it out.
i'll send you a number.
call me in 00 hours, please.
i am security services.
hands behind your back!
you just let him go.
calm down, francis.
we don't want you to have a heart attack.
the deadly one.
mi0 now seems like a complete liability, and i am the last friend in the government of mi0's government.
so right now, i really need you to be nice to me.
in other words, is he crazy?
that doesn't contradict him with his last three psychological assessments.
she refused to join.
harry pearce hasn't stopped being.
as crazy as it may be, i'll catch him anyway...
like, for instance.
he asked me to help him get lost.
didn't it occur to you to accept your request and bring her to us?
just because your life hasn't killed you since harry fired you, don't think we can't put your life in a fucking mess right now.
since we threaten each other, all three of you, don't fall for the blood that you don't swing on the cliff.
your entire organization seems to be disabled right now.
find qasim.
fully loaded.
they're ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i saw this name working on a case.
i thought they were relieving you.
they did.
now what really happened?
the kidnapping may have been arranged by someone in the service.
do you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i left it two weeks ago.
there must be one around here.
tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't apply.
when i was 00, i was hanging out with a kid who makes money transfers.
the division was interested in some people using it, so they got to me.
you started as an agent?
and when i was done, they asked me to train as an officer.
when i told you, my family came back to me.
and if someone you were working for helped qasim to escape, that would be a problem, right?
all right.
something felt wrong that day.
robass, my team leader, he was in the front vehicle with me.
he told me not to open the weapons compartment.
she ordered me to chase.
where does he live?
it's loaded.
w00 account apron.
panama city.
the service fund.
june, what are you...
who are you?
you told me not to chase qasim.
you told me not to chase when i treated my gun.
we took a oath, rob.
i'm not saying anything until we get to thames house.
we're not going to thames house thames house.
will, what did you find?
qasim's bodyguards were deliberately weakened.
the team leader was in on it.
he's just a footman.
find out who gave the order.
the americans think mi0 is a weak link, and i think one of them is joining them.
when qas escaped, we fell out of our sight.
the cia has taken it completely.
fire... fire... fire... fire...
he was gonna shoot.
pulse...
dead, dead.
he's dead.
listen.
you should go home.
june!
i'll deal with this, but you have to go, now.
i never heard of a piece killed with a song like that.
who's warrender's eyelash shot?
landon miller.
agency hawk.
he's trying to ensure his continuing support, hoping not to give him the keys to the kingdom.
every time i see you, francis, you seem to be buried another inch or two deeper in the recesses of some swivel-eyed cow from langley or the pentagon.
you don't have to tell me.
i think at times like these, we shouldn't forget who's swinging the flag.
francis.
i'm trying to help, but he's officially accusing me of doing business for the cia.
tonight, your generals, your politicians, your spies, met for a celebration.
tonight, we attack the hearts of their powers.
our enemy, your sons and daughters, the politicians who send death in illegal wars.
spies who spy on you like you are criminals.
this war is beyond religious differences.
all flights out of the united kingdom, flying all flights...
she had it.
warrender lived.
if you have a way to get to qasim, tell me now.
there's another way.
qasim's wife.
asma shishani.
the fsb has her.
if i find out where they're holding her, she gives the traitor.
you made a deal with her.
yeah.
and if we succeed, it will lead us right to him.
surrender and set it up.
how do you know the russians have women?
in exchange for an expired cia agent stuck in moscow.
i can reach a distance, but you have to open the secret door.
it's a ip address.
you're kidding.
it's the only way, will.
harry's getting help from somewhere.
i've cleared your old contacts, but i need access to personnel files to do it properly.
but it still won't take you anywhere exciting.
in position.
looks like i'm gonna have to steal more extra bandwidth.
the drink.
malcolm?
all right, i'm in.
i'm looking at the server now.
harry, we gotta go.
can't we do this faster?
i can do it.
but unfortunately, this machine is from a century ago.
the g branch already pulled these.
erin watts.
might be worth a closer look.
fill in the blanks for me.
but i was exposed to an agent.
i almost got him out.
i was a colleague for less than a year.
sooner or later they make you choose.
all right, i'll leave you alone.
is it?
sure why?
i'm sorry, will.
harry.
harry!
harry, what have you done?
stay away from the computer.
i didn't feel like saying this before, but i hope you know what you're doing.
is harry working with qasim?
he stole an entire gchq data archive.
everything we have on our west agent friends in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
she showed up at the schrefield airport cctv.
i don't know.
harry didn't attack that cyber on his own.
then who's helping him?
except you.
and you still protect her.
why?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i'll find him.
and there's a threat.
according to analysis, there'll be a large-sized attack within 00 hours, multiple targets.
an agent in charge of qasim's escape is missing.
there are signs of struggle at home.
do you know anything about that?
how's your mother, holloway?
i heard it wasn't very good.
he hasn't had it since he died.
understandable, but really.
and then that door work comes.
i know, i know.
harry was right about one thing.
you're not good enough.
home secretary, can we really hope that qasim will stop attacking again?
we've destroyed the threat to our freedom and our way of life for our lives.
your ability to hurt us may be important, but it's the end of something.
you'll find that we have no limits.
they won't listen.
they never killed our women?
we're making the world a better place, brother.
the transplant team is in position at the airport.
we have a warrant by the atc to block the road to the convict car when necessary.
i guess i owe you one.
you were totally right about vass.
danke.
alexanderplatz.
it's on the northwest corner by the metron in'00.
we have a safe house.
call it nostalgia.
don't forget to bring the archive.
don't forget to bring his wife.
how did you find me?
there's only one place in berlin to meet.
you told me.
northwest corner of alexanderplatz.
no emotionality.
it's the price of qasim's wife.
when she fsb out of custody, qasim will give me a number.
and he will take me to the traitor.
they'll destroy the service where it's safe to take it.
get in the car, harry.
there's an old hotel 00 minutes away.
my contact can meet us there with three clean passports for my contact.
you're going home.
i'm sorry about that.
why are you here, miss keaton?
keep moving, harry.
i killed someone because of you.
you're c0, aren't you?
what are you doing, harry?
talent discovery.
so which one of you found it?
jesus, will.
prep is everything.
and vass?
when he came to my house, i reported it.
i said someone was asking about qasim's escape.
they put me in command, and they told me what to do.
they went to vass's house before us and planted the evidence.
i've arranged vass to escape.
you think i want to do it?
i know my mission.
i'm the only one who knows here.
you were set up.
she's right, will.
but i wonder if miss keaton is sure about me.
it was a secure command chain.
what was i supposed to do?
do you believe him?
yeah.
i'm sure your men will come and find you... if your usefulness still exists.
after all this, what did you think they were gonna do to you?
i did what they wanted from me.
we're changing the deal.
we're taking qasim's wife to london.
tell her to get in the trade or she'll never see her again.
let's go get her.
what happened to alexanderplatz?
sudden agoraphobia feeling.
i'm afraid there was something wrong with qasim's wife.
at least work enough to put it in my car.
harry.
colonel.
i hate to be indecent, but we're gonna need your clothes.
while the search for adam qasim is concentrating on the u.s. army's national ray line, everyone who's travelling on the united kingdom's national track has to demonstrate valid identification and must
i have your wife.
let me talk to him.
the russians put him to sleep and...
bullshit.
i'm bringing her to london.
no.
i'll tell your whore you said goodbye.
did the baby thing become too much?
no, it's you.
i trusted june.
you were right to relieve me of duty.
despite everything i've done, you're still trying to do something good here.
i won't let his sacrifices be for nothing.
it was here.
was it fast?
he could have left me, but he chose not to.
you try anything, anything, i can't guarantee anyone's safety.
nobody's.
you bring my wife, i'll give you your phone number.
here we go.
hello?
holloway.
this message came from the h branch.
me.
we can catch qasim, but we need help.
and let's report.
one clean choice, hannah.
trust me, and help me.
or leave.
do good or do well, right?
shit.
they're approaching the location.
what i wrote last night is updating the self-replicating algorithm, constantly updating all potential looks.
so sudoku won't cut it?
please.
all right, we're here.
how much time do we have?
i'm looking at 000 cameras.
give me something.
as soon as he realizes we're playing him, he's gone.
wait.
she was working 00 seconds ago.
are you sure?
yes, confirmed.
camera's out in the last minute.
0th floor, east corner.
harry, we have to stall.
i have to hope you're looking at us.
yes?
try the south.
i have his wife.
you're supposed to look south.
give me the number.
give me the number or we'll leave.
turn around or you're dead.
here.
him too.
i haven't got him yet.
you have 0 seconds to turn around.
turn.
maybe this man never saw her.
almost there.
him?
kill.
give me the number.
don't!
stop!
no!
okay?
will, she's fine.
shooter's dead.
then it's over.
malcolm, feather.
yes?
my wife is dead, isn't she?
harry, listen.
let hannah report us.
harry?
hannah, why did harry take off the headphones?
i don't know.
let us know.
bring sco00 here, right now.
two trucks full of rdx are leaving from limehouse north industrial park within the next 00 minutes.
how do you know?
qasim just told me.
trucks full of bombs leaving in 00 minutes.
i think we got him.
let's go!
armed police!
stay where you are!
clear!
clear!
eyes on the main target?
negative!
negative!
negative, sir.
command center, clear area.
harry.
he sold his own men.
why would he do that?
what did you do?
armed police!
freeze!
move!
you have to tell them everything, harry.
i think we have a lot to talk about.
this might be way over your head.
since the southeast corner of alexanderplatz.
keep your eye on holloway.
make sure she's safe.
maybe we won't be so hasty.
did you find qasim?
harry will talk.
you still don't know him.
qasim gave up his entire operation.
what did you say to him?
i should have thought they'd set you free after berlin.
they want to offer you a deal.
throw it all over harry and go.
i told them i'd quit after doing this.
there's no way out.
i can't.
there's an emergency backup key sitting around your neck.
whatever you're after...
what would ruth think?
what did you give him?
check the back.
southeast corner.
i found harry in the northwest corner of alexanderplatz.
the opposite.
where you trap someone.
harry?
i gave her you.
get down!
get down!
get down!
lock us up.
get down!
get down!
we're not here for you!
we're here for them.
get down!
think of your families.
hamza.
why?
there are 00 men on the other side of these doors.
you must surrender.
come here.
open up!
if you think we're negotiating...
open the door.
but he'll kill us.
there are so many demons in one room.
the only way out of here alive is to surrender...
you think i want out?
how many people in this room have ended lives?
my people's lives.
your people?
no one asked you to speak for them, to kill for them.
if you want a hostage...
i think he made it clear he wasn't interested in hostages.
i'm the director of mi0.
kill me and put the gun down.
otherwise, you're nothing but a dead terrorist.
no one will ever see you as a hero.
when we're done, you're gonna be a drunk, stoned, beat up his wife, a powerless heathen.
in exchange for the fact that a couple of marrakech boys were driving the hooker and begging them to piss on it, we'll give them a free ticket to disneyland.
we can't remember you very well, can we, adam?
wait, wait, wait.
i pulled the chopper back.
but...
you fucking coward.
i thought you were fighting a higher standard.
i'm sorry about your wife's death, adam.
i know what this can do to you.
is that supposed to stop me?
it's okay.
stop!
why did you bring her here?
i made a choice.
without plan b.
why do you think i keep you out of that room?
people are still dead, harry.
less than the ones who will die in the explosions.
how could you make such a choice?
that's my job.
auntie, can you come outside and play?
hello, geraldine.
finally, it comes down to who's telling the lying the longest.
right?
if we had protected that morning, qasim would never have escaped.
you gave the met's air unit an order to turn down all mi0 requests for all of it, didn't you?
that's the advantage of being a maniac.
i don't have to prove it.
sacrificing her own service so she can be questioned by a foreign power.
the americans would have made you the general manager, no doubt.
how many more lives was that promotion worth?
what did you think you did, harry?
the service is dying.
but if i'd given up the moment i realized i was on the losing side, my career would be too short.
blowing my brains out and finding my 00-year-old nephew...
i think it came from you.
what is this?
his subtle intestine is going through more than two hours, or causing an unstoppable bleeding.
it leaves no trace.
how clever.
i was afraid that would be your answer.
so i took the chance to make the choice.
it's not lunch that makes you sick.
i ate beef ribs.
tell me you're lying, harry.
please.
tell me you didn't betray your country.
it's been 0 hours, geraldine.
you can spend the last two hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd play with your beautiful niece.
i'm thinking.
your message said you had something to tell me.
they're surveying ruth's grave.
you can't leave now.
i actually have something that you should be.
your father was wearing it the night he died.
stasi, he pulled out everything that could work, and he found a way to get into the fsb archive somewhere.
she was wearing a wedding ring on the night of her operation?
i didn't kick you out because you're not good enough.
after your father, i couldn't...
i should have protected you.
good ones don't last forever, will.
then who does?
they're like me.
it would help if you knew your problem and told the men at the door.
there's room for every guest at hotel middle school.
gather in one order.
these new problems kill in the dark.
these people will be grateful to you when it gets dark.
i think we should keep them here to keep them safe, but i'm worried things will get worse.
they have no idea who caused the dark problem.
and it's not what hides in the dark that we should be concerned about.
we still haven't figured out how to handle that fog wall yet.
maybe this is a blessing.
this was the latest from in-flight safetism.
i'm on your side and i might need a new job.
i've got it under control, but if i can get another pillow for my beauty sleep, it'll be appreciated.
try to fix things.
we talked about this.
it's almost impossible to remove the problem without having someone killed him.
sure, i just need some irrevocable material, and maybe information that doesn't exist.
i'm gonna need a team.
any idea what's going on?
but there's a bad element.
it's the only way to protect the rest of us.
it's too risky to drive because of the magnet problem.
an engineer to help fix the power plant.
she volunteered as soon as she knew.
if things don't work out, you can use her problem for the switchboard.
what the hell are you thinking?
the unsanctioned killer is out there somewhere.
and he really wants to prove to you that he wants to help.
well, whatever the reason, keep an eye on her for me, okay?
because neither of us is immune to new problems.
i'm not just saying it's because it's mom.
i'll call the person who caused the dark trouble at school when you're gone.
he stole those batteries and put us in danger.
there was no other choice, dwight.
this is the third case in two weeks.
now the serial killer is in this building.
all right, i'm gonna go talk to dwight.
my father always said you were a good man.
mara's father?
there may be a way, but it might seem more frightening if you want me to explain it, so don't ask.
even on the map, maine, i can't find haven.
are you telling me you can't find a town with 00 thousand people?
that's not the problem.
then why didn't we use aether in the first place to end the problems?
i can't bring them in sealed.
so how do we find it?
gloria brought a box of stuff that duke left in gull.
i don't think william has what i need, and aether is just the first phase.
you told his wife you'd find him.
it's easy to take from the edge, but sometimes things aren't what they seem.
i have a town to protect.
no wonder the plant's working at 00%.
guys, i'll try, but remember, i've never done anything like this before.
they made me park the car so i could talk to you, but i don't have enough money to pay for the oil change.
if all goes well, i'll be back with aether before the sun sets.
this is peggy's husband, rolf.
there's enough panic and fear.
the same killer who killed my son 00 years ago?
we call him the murderer who didn't leave a trace.
what else are you hiding from me, vince?
dwight's doing everything he can to get the rules to accept, but he's not the type to kill people.
in this haven, exile is the same thing as executing.
thanks to our friend there, we're keeping them in some kind of prison.
he says the generator works at 00%.
damn it, when the generator overloaded it must have cleared out the energy reserves.
that explains why the power's in the town.
at this speed, like, five minutes.
it's almost over, and that's the only thing that's keeping us from dying in the dark.
here, i rearranged the generator arrangements to get the power to the town faster, but there's nothing more we can do.
they better get back.
help each other.
turn the lights around.
share your supplies.
you see, i'm happy here.
i got your message.
get in the car now.
come on, jump!
if the war lies ahead, we should be thankful, even slean.
i don't think there's anything worse than being in love.
i don't like it here.
every story has two sides.
whoever's behind this is a traitor.
let's go.
he asked me to represent him at slean's wedding.
palace, you are my brother's love.
that's why you're my brother.
you've probably seen bigger places here in the iraqi realms.
none of them were ruled by a woman.
you must choose a second person to escort you and watch your interests during the ritual.
then you will hear the bonds of your friends and relatives.
i have no relatives here.
my mother and the others will keep you company.
kela, this is the palace from bregan.
rheda, must i always be protected?
i don't really get it.
but i know i have to marry slean.
i'll love him.
this marriage can't happen.
abrecan trusts you.
what do you do?
no carpenter.
then they can use you on the wall.
who are you?
a friend of the house president.
like i said, i have business to attend to.
we need to figure out how to handle it.
varr said i couldn't accept presents.
it'll stay between us then.
every bride should smell good when the wedding time comes.
remember, this is our secret.
sit down.
we'll take what we'll get while they look at the wounded.
you wanted to talk?
all right.
kela, it's time for your month.
elvina, will you be my second person?
for the game.
we need to talk sometime.
we need to discuss reasons why marriage shouldn't work out.
if we don't carry out our mission, their marriage can be canceled.
beowful!
let's celebrate.
old tradition!
the dress smells pimp.
i'm so sorry.
it was just a little mistake.
that's all.
we're gonna help slean give the symbol to his bride.
sounds easy.
breca!
open the door!
come on, you stinking mudborn.
come on!
come on!
give me your arm.
come on!
slean.
be quiet, kela is sleeping.
are they ready for this marriage?
i don't understand why slean didn't want to marry kela.
i don't think so.
put your feelings aside and do what's best for everyone.
would you put what you want aside for others?
that's all we have to do.
if someone pleases their whole life, that person doesn't exist.
it must make you feel pretty free to think that way.
try it.
tell every rock the truth.
then you can look at each other and light the fire that symbolizes your marriage.
then you'll be husband and wife.
did you love someone before?
no.
before i come here...
do you want to be thane?
tell my uncle i'm done with him.
yeah.
come on!
move!
you let him go.
we're not done here yet.
don't you understand?
i've betrayed my mother and i've dried my uncle out.
this woman was sent here to kill you!
i don't know.
was it?
i killed my brother.
she's the one she should have been with today.
even if the earth was destroyed, mara had everything.
people loved him because he was kind.
my father loved him as his first child.
she and rowan were lovers.
then i had the chance to escape.
i wouldn't need anything.
he was dead without fever.
he was healing.
i poisoned her.
slean, i won't tell anyone what you're doing here today and what's going on.
or stay.
i know, but she's beowull.
she went to bed last night.
but we can choose who to draw our fate with.
light the fire with me.
you want to be a thane?
i can help you.
against those who oppose you.
they can't take it from you anymore, rheda.
with this marriage, you are jarl of the shieldlands.
these rules of jarl should be followed by every tribe.
if the blood doesn't pay, a killer's life will be terminated.
the thieves will be branded out of society.
the prices of all the merchandise in the shieldlands will be set by jarl.
what right does he have to decide the price of fish?
we're the ones who risk their lives to catch the pandiri every summer.
you should have told me about the rules.
you were where your people needed you the most, at the watch.
i couldn't distract you.
it was enough messed up already.
you're late for the pandiri.
some people think you kidnapped her again.
but if you fail, bregan will be miserable and open the winter.
breca's wanted for murder, you know that.
kill him!
kill breca right now!
i got it!
do it without any explanation and we're all dead.
after he escaped the gallows, he hired us to turn breca into his blood.
did we ask the guy who helped him escape the first time?
that's why we'll welcome you.
but we should keep breca.
heorot could be standing on our doors as we speak!
what time did we kill young women?
what do you mean?
you've been hiding in the shadows for too long, abrecan.
don't forget who you're talking to.
talk.
the boy wants breca's life or blood money for his brother's murder.
i didn't mean to kill anyone.
hurry!
thank you.
breca made my mother fall in love with her.
he's looking for the stuff he thinks has money, then he steals the money and runs, this son of a bitch.
he left my mother and took everything precious with him.
and my brother went after him.
but it cost you your life.
breca, is that true?
i'll pay the blood money for the boy's brother.
lila, do you have 00 silver dollars?
i don't want money, i want blood!
silence!
if the blood is paid, breca will be released.
you lied to me.
pandiri.
pandiri!
put him through.
get ready, they're coming.
i saw it.
get out!
the council has gathered.
he wants to take my place on the h while i'm missing the pandiri.
you let me down, she married slean keela, rheda was jarl!
you don't understand.
tell the council our enemies are gathered, that your sister cannot rule, that you want to save the shieldlands.
so tell me you're distracted.
tell me.
i'm sorry.
i knew breca killed someone, but the story she told me was different.
it's just his fault.
lila, nobody thinks bad things about you...
that's all i have.
you did?
there's no 00 silver here.
it's not enough.
and i'm gonna hold breca while she's at it.
was there enough money?
lila?
just drop it, please.
you're not talking to lila.
get on your horse, leave herot and never come back.
there's no room for you here anymore.
if herot's going to be attacked, i want to fight properly.
if herot's attacked, i'll protect you.
let's try it.
it's not about mudborn.
i don't want to talk about him.
i want to know why you lied about training me.
it's wasted on you.
you don't even want to be spoiled.
really?
i didn't know we were training the blacksmith!
move.
now!
is he fighting girls now?
the scenery seemed more like the blacksmith was training the huskarl.
i know you think i let you down.
that i can't focus on my duties in bregan.
but i have my reasons.
you mean betrayal to one of your own blood.
a warrior in this land needs a warrior!
someone who will take your people out of the darkness.
a man in power to control!
you're talking about betraying your sister to hide the fact that you can't provide for your people.
what's the point of having fish if we're all to be slaughtered?
i am here to give our thane the vote of no confidence.
the ones against abrecan being a thane.
decided.
a new thane will be appointed and announced in the morning.
get up.
next.
nobody.
don't think that's a game!
we're lazy, distracted.
this is gonna work here.
from now on, we'll work like dad hrothgar.
i didn't want to interrupt.
you're a good teacher.
a great thane wants a strong army behind it.
we don't have to share the same bed, but if we don't share the same room, people will talk.
i always liked watching heorot from here.
it looks invincible.
if i tell mom the truth, i lose her trust.
and a chance to rule one day.
what if abrecan attacks?
heorot might fall.
aren't you going to recommend it?
i trust you.
the decision you make will be right.
and i'll be there when you make it.
you'll be thane.
you just have to believe.
pandiri.
pandiri!
it's the panel!
play the horn!
i order you, sound the horn!
abrecan, give it up.
if we don't act immediately, the opportunity will be lost.
why... why... why... why...
you, help me with the net.
help me with the net now.
why don't you help me?
pandiri!
come on, hurry!
go find me a sack.
people shouldn't leave their valuables lying around.
you owe mom an apology.
but i'm a warrior and our honour is at stake.
so i'll take your life.
go back to mommy, little girl.
greetings.
i didn't need your help.
because he didn't have enough money to save you.
be thankful you didn't kill him, vishka.
if we don't get the nets in, our prey will be lost.
no, she won't.
get ready.
abrecan, no!
hold the rope still!
hurry, they'll eat you raw!
pandiri, pandiri!
pandiri, pandiri!
hold on!
now get back!
check it out.
there will be songs about this hunt.
a catch you won.
i have a dream about us.
being the biggest tribe in shieldlands!
we're not going to follow the laws a jarl couldn't even keep a sword.
who's with me?
abrecan, abrecan, abrecan!
i have to warn beowf.
bregan!
elvina!
his warriors are coming together.
this time they intend to destroy us.
beowful!
if we turn around today, we'll see that more danger and more harm comes from religious belief.
my wife, stand-up, in my shows that if i talked about soviet communism or stalin's brutality, it would seem less embarrassing.
that's the situation, especially the philosophy, of the kind of interrogating people who make trouble for people.
presenting a situation perfectly correct in itself can cause serious damage, damage.
when the prophecy doesn't happen, we make fun of those people and the whole world will make fun of us.
because of this problem with richard dawkins, i had a friendly disagreement with him.
maybe we should be more aggressive with richard.
especially america is wrapped and shaken with christian faith.
they're sure the world is what their religion says.
we'll get rid of the bad guys.
i'd like to write a book like that if i could.
but, of course, one of my fears, what happens next.
what kind of chaos?
how true is it to people who think that religion protects our civilization and our goodness somehow?
religion is like morale viagra for many people.
if that's true, if religion does lead to people's moral lives, then somebody has to take it seriously, we're just gonna have to exonerate, and you're gonna have to go downstairs to the state of the state.
because there may be many people on the bottom and we can create chaos from the fear of these people.
many people want their lives to mean something, and where does that come from?
but there must be something better than religion.
yeah, there's definitely hope.
let's see what happens.
sure.
at least you didn't get a piercing.
i don't know how to explain this to amy.
i'm the stupidest man in the world.
all right, cut it out.
i'm the stupidest man in the world.
okay, you win this.
i can't find emma's papers.
honey, just so you know, even if you find the original receipt, you can't return the baby.
i need to get the paper angela signed when she left emma at my door and gave me the one attorney.
i'm finally getting health insurance for what i'm responsible for and myself.
i haven't talked to her since the night we did emma.
calm down.
you gave me all the important papers about the baby so they could be safe.
do you have all the papers?
her father's little girl is a big girl.
maybe something balloonful.
that looks good!
you robbed a clown?
today is your birthday!
first birthday tomorrow.
you used to party all the time when you were a kid.
i can't celebrate my birthday after...
"happy birthday, miley."
you know those papers i've been keeping for ben?
how irresponsible do you think i am?
but i...
maybe i didn't mailed them in on time, and i didn't mail them, and i may not be the only one of emma's attorney's.
we were all excited for the new baby came and i didn't have the stamp!
look, i'm gonna ask angela if we have this document signed again.
since you're ben's best friend and you're the only one who's ever seen her...
i like it, all right.
all right, emma finally slept.
hey, danny, what's the reason riley didn't want to celebrate her birthday?
seriously, why does she hate so much?
ben, riley didn't celebrate her birthday after her 00-year-old disaster.
are you sure you want to watch this?
i think i'd remember if it was a disaster.
all right, come on, everybody.
danny, where are we going?
luckily, the future where you win a real mustache and lose one person's weight.
is ben here?
benjamin wheeler, come here and celebrate riley's birthday.
well, i can tell you that's the best birthday i've ever had.
tell the cake you didn't do anything.
actually, try to save it with the perm, then cut it out.
is riley still in love with ben or is that something that happened when she was a kid?
unless you still love riley.
i ruined her sweet 00 party.
not during her birthday, but the rest of the time she loves you for sure.
if ben is so irresponsible that he lost the papers and so irresponsible to confront me, maybe he doesn't deserve to take emma's attorney alone.
if it makes you feel any better, we do most of the work.
i can imagine how hard it must be to let emma go.
i knew it would finally upset her if you thought how beautiful or funny or wonderful she was gonna be!
in your presence, in the city streets of your presence, the distinguished tank force of the u.s. army, only three minutes self-destand trove trooper 00.
and as madox-00 the weapon we understand is a highly advanced combat capability in limited areas.
what's more, a uh-00 has more destroy power than blackhawk.
both for anti-terrorist and anti-gerilla operations.
miss kusumoto is also the chief architect of software preparing for "tankbuster".
today, in order to expose madox's abilities with the badge, he personally moved to the pilot's cabin.
unit 0 will go to ichigaya tonight.
we're in a hurry, see how quickly we can get.
and...
miss kusumoto today, you've humiliated me.
i didn't come here for congratulations.
there's only one thing i'll tell you:
wow!
kouji... kouji... kou
what is it?
onose, you leave this to me!
they threw away their garbage.
i'm telling you, don't worry.
i'll buy you dinner in return, won't i?
sdf's transport car...
according to the report reports it was natural to have been encountered...
obviously a terrorist job.
you're too alien to the easternblock operations.
i hope you know what you're saying!
i hope you see the burden of this incident is entirely yours.
either way, this situation is critical.
we were transferring him for a field test!
it's bad!
i have to be in the operation.
besides, madox-00.
we're having trouble investigating the crime scene.
shouldn't we have the police in the call?
we must prepare ourselves for the worst and prepare the help troops.
i'm the only one who can stand up to madox and take a head.
even though lieutenant kilgore is one of the most troopers in the military, he's the best tanks in the army.
is-is this okay?
nobody in the building?
anyway, i'm a little relieved.
shiori was really pretty...
when england goes to read, all the boys in japan will mourn.
where did you learn that?
he called me in the morning and asked me to give you a message.
use the remote to open it up.
it's burning!
he was able to adjust his pilot's cabin.
makes you feel like wearing ski boots.
we got a signal activating from the madox.
it's a disaster.
could you warm it up in the microwave?
i really made a fool of myself!
shiori, what do you intend?
defense forces?
you're working with a prototype air-condition tank.
don't you dare turn tokyo into vietnam!
tokyo or vietnam, for me, all the battlefields are the same.
you'll make a disaster.
oh, don't freak out.
i'm gonna get through this before things get too hot.
lieutenant kilgore is using the most sophisticated tank and anti-tank helicopters, and my promise is to get madox to take on madox.
in that case, the city centre will be in a major panic.
in these conditions, there must be someone who can stop kilgore and madox.
what can we do?
we don't know what madox's target is yet.
if i manage to find him before ensign kilgore, then maybe i believe we'll have a chance.
but madox's condition...
i'm using unit 0, pulled out of power tests.
how much chance?
hey, you heard me!
wait for me.
that's it!
how's it going!
what are you doing on the road?
i can't wait by the side of the road like a sidewalk!
you really are a driver, man!
i've got plenty to finish the installments!
he's back at the cabriet!
bye, assholes!
yeah, saturdays, shinjuku was trapped in a car traffic.
i can't lose my mark in this crowd!
this "madox" must really be valuable.
spider 0 to jackal 0.
target moving!
he's moving on himself...
one of the apaches was shot down.
all troops have been authorized to destroy madox.
just like kilgore wanted.
he's heading towards the skyscrapers with the apache on him.
evacuate the civilians immediately!
they're coming all over me!
i gotta go over there, take the west exit.
another her armor's gone crazy!
all right, back to work, madox!
i hear you.
and i say, "you're a pain in the ass."
if anybody's causing trouble, it's you.
"just" what?
none of your business.
i can't do anything i don't know what it means!
no!
all right, captain!
"nsr parking spot - "nsrr parking spot -
exit exit exit exit."" exit exit
i did it!
shiori is up there!
i won't let you take another step.
i can't fight!
i can't waste any more time with you!
i thought you were an amateur, so i shouldn't be nice to you.
time to jump around and stop jumping.
it won't work!
he's just a boy!
what were you trying to do that for?
my name is sugimoto kouji, and i'm a sophomore at kanto institute of technology.
all i wanted to do was meet my girlfriend who's waiting for me at the nsr building.
first he put me in, then he dropped a chopper himself.
i got you.
miss kusumoto, this is spider 0, kilgore speaking.
really, i watched your show.
you fight pretty hard.
i'll take care of yokota, personally, whatever it takes.
hey, where are the civilians in the building?
what's so important?
why am i going crazy when i think of you?
madox on the target.
he'll come after you to destroy him.
most of all, i know how to walk and use my hands.
it's up to you to make it.
either the madox is destroyed, or you take kilgore!
they damaged my legs.
i can't move anymore.
you think i can beat him?
you were fine when we were fighting.
did you read the entire manual?
hey, madox.
adi it!
come kill me!
wouldn't you stand up a little more and raise my "happiness"?
l-lanet!
what, you look like a turtle back!
if you can't do that much, you're gonna ruin the name of tankbuster!
your numbers won't work on me!
kouji!
coming!
you were brave!
i'm sick of the cat-fare play!
you fell into my medicine trap!
if i fall, i will take you with me, madox!
that's messed up with madox!
there are some very important things i want to tell you, shiori.
paul would never hurt anyone.
" cannot be understood."
i'm not your mother, brian.
you don't even like me.
are you really staying?
not everything was clear.
i haven't even written my hour yet.
there's noise coming through the righteous bronson.
can they sew her up again?
what's your mother's name?
am i reacting to the inside?
yeah, but searching his room, that would be a violation of his privacy.
john, what would you say if i told you i asked the waitress at doc magoo's if she didn't show up the night we lost the marfan patient in marfan weaver?
i'd say it's full of people with a pager.
where did he get these?
will you buy the tickets?
someone might come and claim the body.
abby, can you take a look at something?
what patient?
how are you?
or find someone else to have lunch lunch with you at lunch with somebody else you can have lunch with
try to find his father.
please call my social worker and take me somewhere else?
can you please get me out of this room?
he stabbed carter.
why outside?
not yet.
i don't want him taken anywhere else he doesn't know about.
their place is more comfortable than the emergency services and the morgue.
who took libertique out of the sewing room?
you gotta clear the path?
sats are 00 sats are sats.
he's on parole.
what bruce lee is in martial arts, i am in love.
they're discharging paul.

marcel, you set me up?
marcel, talk to me, brother!
you set me up, brother?

i didn't tell you to kill that girl!
that's it.
my sister was only 00 and you killed her!
look at me!
look at me.
okay.
i just got out, but i lost my key.
their christian mothers were lazy perhaps.
...they left scented.

it's still kind of hard, isn't it?
what are you talking about, brother?
my guy's here.

aaron and the other idiot, ed.
i don't know what they're doing.
not in my place, man!
okay, brother.

ed!
what the fuck?
brother, a woman left it on the train.
and you brought her here, to me?
look, brother, it's more complicated than you think, okay?
where did you get that?
i found it somewhere.
00 cops with foam came out of nowhere.
for your stupid life, that was the smartest thing you've ever done!
what are you gonna do with this baby?
give it to the cops?
am i supposed to change my mind and go back?
i look like a pedophile.
no, they'll send me home or something, wouldn't they?
a woman leaves her own child on the train!
as you can see, she doesn't want him.
now i'm gonna change your underwear!
let me keep an eye on the gun for you, okay?
will you help me find her mother?
i have more important things to do than deal with this kind of bullshit.
you give me the gun, i'll hide it somewhere, okay?
give me your stuff.
why did you put it there, man?
take it!
no, just call me when you're done with this stupid stuff, okay?
because we have things to do, okay, faggot?
you daddy!
let go!
move!
can ashley come?
sir?
i got it covered, man.
well, i'm a little nervous, hon.
what are you nervous about?
we'll sort this out.
well, i was talking to vince...
this is a kid my mother doesn't want.
what are you doing, brother?
what's wrong with you, man?
why are you acting like a bitch?
who are you, my brother, jeremy kyle?
you can't sell someone's baby to someone else!
especially vince and carol.
the other day, we were selling junkies to this guy!
no, you didn't, because she doesn't want to be found, man.
they'll give this kid to another vince and carol.
let me go, brother.
i told you i'd handle it, man.
what am i gonna tell people?
yeah, yeah, fine.
i do, but don't tell anyone we're here!
just half, give me the rest.
i can't believe you sold a baby!
you didn't want before, did you?
if i go through all this stress, i lose the money, i lose everything, then you got to talk to someone properly, okay?
a nice lady.
i'm in "fuck you" kind of way.
what's going on in there?
you sell drugs in a bar, right?
either you or your stupid brother took my gun and i need it.
you have 0 hours to get my gun back, or i'm gonna break people's houses.
i'm leaving.
she always spoils things, doesn't she?
why are you bringing this bitch to my place when my wife's upstairs?
what's going on?
he was having trouble with a solid russian mob, with all the trouble.
she thought they were gonna kill the baby.
so she left the baby on the train.
now, take this money, and i'll give you the rest when i meet ed.
it's not a fool, vince, and you know it!
you don't get it when you're out of your mouth, do you?
it's not your fucking problem in my mouth alone!
no, he said your cock was in his mouth.
i'm not giving them the baby!
they can't take it either!
calm down, okay?
now get up and get that baby!
here!
gun, man!
just know you're dead to give it to you.
they may not leave you because you have no family.
what flowers did she like, any suggestions?
white roses are good, right?
fuck off then!
fuck you!
are you the owner of this car?
but you stopped me for nothing.
but first, let's raise our glasses to the new owner, chester.
to chester.
i hope she will tremble on these magnificent monsters like i've done for years.
cheers.
i promise to keep the standard of this show up and you will be proud.
have a good trip where dreams come true.
thank god.
even if that sour german is gone, that domination will pass us.
marjorie, what a shame...
thank you, chester.
now, if you'll excuse me, the original family, the monsters and the weirdo community- let him spend his last moments alone.
bye.
there's someone else to thank.
mr. richard spencer.
our lives have completely changed your course.
cheers.
mm!
but we're gonna have a great feast tonight, and if it's later, we're gonna watch a movie from my own collection.
not the sign of the cross again.
no.
we're watching freaks tonight.
do you know this movie, richard?
i don't know.
it's a great movie.
tell me about it, eve, paul.
ah.
cleopatra is a pro-induced trapeze artist, and marries a dwarf who makes small shows.
but the point is to poison him and put him in his legacy.
he plays all the freaks on his finger until one day, he gets really drunk and hates his true intentions.
then all freaks turn against him.
they take their revenge at night with knives and guns.
home, home.
darling... don't tell the ending to your taste.
that sounds great!
there's a lot to do before we head west.
i can't.
shut up and sit down.
you deserve it.
what happened to you?
come on, richard, pick up.
i've been thinking about you for a long time.
oh, thank god.
when we saw our exhibit, we had clients who stooped, but... no one had fainted.
are you all right, miss?
where are those security guards?
good to know.
now it's your turn.
jesus christ.
i don't even know that.
i already told them everything...
stanley.
elsa... elsa... elsa...
come on...
talk to them.
hollywood!
i'm afraid... that's all it is.
just a dream.
come on, turn it around.
aah!
my god...
no.
please.
my cousin works at the garden of allah.
but you brought death here... and you have to pay for it.
take him down.
come on, come on.
elsa, come on... we need to talk in private.
i believe we'll find something in common.
you think you could run now?
i'm telling the truth.
he killed her.
she's not who you think she is.
and start running.
run!
run!
run!
just because you grew up without a father doesn't mean you have to romanticize the job now that she's dead.
how did he die?
who killed him?
we all did.
he broke the rule.
now.
come on.
that was my father!
he killed a freak!
and the most fragile of us.
you believe his word?
this fraud bitch?
i saw dear ma petite in a jar with my own eyes.
i heard him confess with my own ears.
as for maggie, if she hadn't helped, we'd have more bodies.
i won't forgive him.
all i want is to rot in hell.
in this case, you're gonna be friends with whoever comes along.
maggie's gonna change her bandages.
no!
they're dirty.
now that your mother's not here, it's up to me to protect you and protect you.
i've seen you turn into a man from childhood to a man-- and we need you.
i don't have hands!
i can't even piss myself.
i got an old friend.
he'll come and help you.
he's a real artist.
but the wounds have to heal first.
maggie's gonna help you.
let him.
i'm so sorry.
i hate hurting you.
really?
i thought that was your only gift- to hurt people.
i love you, jimmy.
this part is real.
i always have.
i want to start a new beginning.
we can still go to new york like we planned.
why not?
you're kidding, right?
you think after all you've done, we're just gonna sail into the new horizons?
my hands... in a fucking jar, and it's all on you.
i'm so sorry.
can you bring ma petite back from the dead?
huh?
i've changed, jimmy.
ah!
i knew you were dumb, let's just add blind to your list, okay?
get me someone to focus the lamp!
i can't leave here.
i have to set the right light for the first time, understand?
try again now!
if!
elsa.
sure.
he's watching us.
can't we?
just this once?
please?
okay.
yeah.
mm.
oh.
thank you, chester.
you threw me down.
like an old sock.
i'm sorry, marjorie.
i got a little... carried away, but i'm happy now.
they've got my magic screen, you're in.
maybe i should go.
we can manage, marjorie.
the twins accepted you.
they just don't want you watching them do things.
they're using you, chester.
you're their boss now.
no, they don't.
they love me.
you're a murderer.
no, no.
no.
marjorie.
i know you don't like to talk about it, so don't bring it up, but you... killed them.
and alice and lucy.
impossible.
i'm just a puppet.
hmm.
love destroys you, chester.
you're losing control.
i know...
i'm a monster.
you don't need them.
i'm in.
i know.
please don't leave me, marjorie.
twins?
they have to go.
i know.
they will.
ethel looks great here with the choir girls.
oh, this is from her barnum days.
she was a unique woman.
to ethel.
to ethel.
so what do you say?
didn't anyone hear what spencer said last night?
now everything is in place.
elsa killed ethel.
forest.
car accident.
it was all a stall.
i believe that.
that crazy, vindictive woman gave paul a knife.
elsa's only problem.
i never got it in my head anyway.
i know ethel.
he wasn't someone to kill himself.
it's not a coward.
she wouldn't do that to her own child, and she wouldn't do it to us.
and leave a decent note.
we all know what we're gonna do if someone comes after us.
our future has one security.
that's elsa not living.
did you ever imagine that would make you feel that way, dot?
thank god you told me about marjorie.
all he had to do was push him.
i think we certainly made a good impression on him.
good evening, girls.
what are you doing here?
i'm here to extend a friendly xindalis.
