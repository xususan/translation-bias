in the end, it comes down to who can tell the longest <unk> </s>
right? </s>
if i wanted to wake up that morning, it would never have been <unk>
the <unk> air force <unk> an order to <unk> all <unk> <unk> right? </s>
that's the advantage of being a <unk> <unk> </s>
no need to be afraid. </s>
<unk> your own <unk> so it can be <unk> by a foreign power. </s>
the americans would have made you <unk> <unk> </s>
how many more lives was that <unk> </s>
what you think you <unk> <unk> </s>
the service is dying. </s>
but the moment i realized i was on the losing side, my <unk> would be too short to <unk> </s>

this came from you, i think. </s>
what is this? </s>
the <unk> <unk> more than six hours or more <unk> in <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
how <unk> </s>
i was afraid that would happen. </s>
that's why i took the opportunity to make a choice. </s>
it's not your lunch, it's your <unk> </s>
so i ate <unk> <unk> </s>
tell me you're lying, harry. </s>
please. </s>
tell me you didn't betray <unk> </s>
it's been four hours, <unk> </s>
you can spend the last two hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd go and play with that beautiful <unk> </s>
i'm thinking. </s>
your letter said something to me. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
you can't go now. </s>
well, i have something you should be. </s>
your father knew that the night he died. </s>
<unk> <unk> everything that could be useful and it found a way to get <unk> out of nowhere. </s>
you were wearing a wedding ring on the night of her <unk> </s>
i'm not going to hurt you because you're not good enough. </s>
after the <unk> the <unk> </s>
you <unk> </s>
<unk> will live forever, will. </s>
then who <unk> </s>
they're like me. </s>
it would be helpful if you could tell the men you knew about <unk> and <unk> </s>
there's room for every <unk> in the <unk> <unk> </s>
form up, single <unk> </s>
this new problem kills in the dark. </s>
these people will be <unk> you in the dark <unk> </s>
i think we're gonna be here to keep them safe, but i just worry that it's only gonna get worse. </s>
they have no idea who caused the dark <unk> </s>
besides, it's not what <unk> in the dark we need to worry about. </s>
let's show these <unk> how to make them feel better. </s>
maybe it's a <unk> </s>
this is the latest from <unk> <unk> </s>
i might need your help and a new job. </s>
it's under <unk> but i'd love another <unk> for my beauty sleep. </s>
try to solve your problems. </s>
we talked about this. </s>
it's almost impossible to destroy him with the <unk> <unk> </s>
of course, i just need information that could be <unk> into <unk> <unk> that aren't in my hands. </s>
i'm gonna need a team. </s>
do you have any idea what's going on? </s>
but i have a bad <unk> </s>
it's the only way to get him back. </s>
with the <unk> problem the car was <unk> </s>
an <unk> to help repair the power <unk> </s>
he <unk> as soon as he found out. </s>
i <unk> her <unk> to make things right. </s>
what the hell do you think you're doing? </s>
<unk> <unk> killer is out there somewhere. </s>
and i think he really wants to prove to you that he really wants to help. </s>
okay, well, whatever the reason, just keep an eye on her for me, okay? </s>
because we're both <unk> to new <unk> </s>
i'm not just saying it's my mom. </s>
while you're gone, i'll look for the person in school who brought up the dark <unk> </s>
he stole those <unk> and put us in danger. </s>
there was no other choice, <unk> </s>
that's the third time in two weeks. </s>
and now the serial killer is in this <unk> </s>
all right, i'm gonna go talk to <unk> </s>
my father always said you were a good man. </s>
<unk> father? </s>
there might be a way, but if you ask me to explain it, it'll be <unk> so you can prove it. </s>
i can't even find a <unk> <unk> on a <unk> </s>
you're telling me you can't find a town with <unk> people? </s>
they didn't cause any problems. </s>
then why didn't we use <unk> to end the <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
so how does it work? </s>
a box of <unk> left behind by <unk> <unk> </s>
i don't think we have the amount that i need, and <unk> is just the first <unk> </s>
<unk> said that you would find him. </s>
it's easy making <unk> but sometimes things aren't what they <unk> </s>
i have a town to <unk> </s>
<unk> of the <unk> is <unk> <unk> </s>
guys, i'll try, but i've never done anything like this before. </s>
i can't even afford to park the car here so i can talk to you, but i don't have the money to buy the oil <unk>
if all goes well, i'll be back with the <unk> at <unk> </s>
that's <unk> husband, <unk> </s>
there's enough panic and fear. </s>
the same killer that killed my son 27 years ago? </s>
we call it <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
what else are you hiding from me, <unk> </s>
<unk> is doing his best to keep order to <unk> the rules, but he's not the type to kill people. </s>
that's the same as <unk> <unk> </s>
thanks to our friend there, we're keeping them in a prison of some kind. </s>
<unk> says he's working <unk> </s>
damn it, <unk> must have <unk> energy <unk> </s>
that explains why the <unk> <unk> in town. </s>
that's like five minutes from the <unk> </s>
so we're almost done and they're the only thing that can keep us in the dark. </s>
there, i <unk> the <unk> <unk> to get into town faster, but there's nothing else we can do. </s>
you better run. </s>
help each other. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> i'm happy here. </s>
i got your <unk> </s>

there are two sides to every story. </s>
<unk> behind this. </s>
let's go. </s>
<unk> <unk> asked me to represent him. </s>
<unk> you're my brother's <unk> </s>
that's why you're my brother. </s>
<unk> <unk> has found bigger places than this place. </s>
none of them were <unk> by a woman. </s>
you have to find someone second to help you <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> during <unk> </s>
and then i heard the <unk> of friend and <unk> </s>

my mother and others will escort you. </s>
<unk> this is <unk> <unk> </s>

you have to learn how to handle it. </s>
<unk> said i could accept <unk> </s>
it'll stay between us, then. </s>
every bride looks beautiful when the time comes. </s>
don't forget, this is our <unk> </s>
sit down. </s>
we'll take what we need from the <unk> </s>
you wanted to talk about it? </s>
all right. </s>
<unk> it's time for your <unk> </s>
<unk> will you be my second? </s>
for the game. </s>
we need to talk sometime. </s>
we need to <unk> the <unk> so we can get rid of the

<unk> </s>
come on, <unk> </s>
for old time's sake. </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>

i don't see why <unk> didn't want to marry <unk> </s>
i don't think so. </s>
let's put the <unk> aside and do what's best for everyone. </s>
<unk> would you put aside for others? </s>
it's what we all must do. </s>
if a man spends his whole life <unk> others, then he's <unk> </s>
it must be very <unk> to think like that. </s>
try it. </s>
either way, tell the truth. </s>
only then can you look upon one another and light the fire <unk> your <unk> </s>
then you'll be man and wife. </s>
have you ever loved anyone? </s>
no. </s>
i thought before i came here... </s>
do you want to be <unk> </s>
tell <unk> i'm done with him. </s>
<unk> </s>

you shot him. </s>
we're not done here. </s>

i killed my brother. </s>
he was the one who should have been with you today. </s>
even as the earth <unk> <unk> had everything. </s>
people like him because they love him. </s>
<unk> <unk> him as his first child. </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
and then you have the opportunity to leave. </s>
i didn't need anything. </s>
<unk> <unk> but he is. </s>
<unk> </s>
after we catch him. </s>
<unk> won't tell anyone what you did here today and what happened. </s>
or stay. </s>
it's <unk> but it's <unk> </s>
she went to bed last night. </s>
but you don't know who <unk> was talking to. </s>

you're the one who got into this mess with the <unk> </s>
<unk> these rules are made by every <unk> </s>

but if you <unk> <unk> will be in the <unk> and the <unk> will be hungry. </s>
<unk> wanted for murder, you know that. </s>
kill him! </s>

i'm <unk> </s>
if you do it without any <unk> we all know it. </s>
<unk> hired us to bring <unk> to justice. </s>
you're talking about the man who helped him escape the first time? </s>
so we'll <unk> that. </s>
but we can't keep the <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> as we speak. </s>
when did you start <unk> young women? </s>
what do you mean? </s>
you have been in <unk> for too long, <unk> </s>
remember who you're talking to. </s>

the boy wants blood money or blood money for the killing of his brother. </s>
i didn't mean to kill anybody. </s>

thank you. </s>
<unk> made my mother fall in love with him. </s>
he's calling for a <unk> who thinks he has money and then <unk> the money, <unk> </s>

so my brother <unk> him. </s>
but it cost him his life. </s>

this is especially when you're <unk> about things that make trouble for people. </s>
it's possible that some real <unk> some real harm might come from <unk> a position which is in itself perfectly true. </s>

for most of the people, moral <unk> is <unk> </s>
well, if that's true, if religion does help people lead moral lives, then one should take very seriously the <unk> that we're just going to eliminate it and let the devil take the <unk> </s>
because the <unk> may be great many people and we might be able to put a <unk> on the hearts of these people.
a lot of people want their lives to mean something, and where does that come from? </s>
yeah, but there's gotta be something better than <unk> </s>

i had it in my head the whole time. </s>
i know <unk> </s>
she wasn't the type to kill herself. </s>
he's not a coward. </s>
she wouldn't have done that to her kid, and she wouldn't have done it to

there's only one <unk> in <unk> </s>
he was <unk> <unk> </s>
you never dreamed of such <unk> <unk> </s>
thank god you said all about <unk> </s>
all he has to do is let her go. </s>

good evening, girls. </s>
what are you doing here? </s>
i came here to <unk> the <unk> </s>
i was able to get a little bit of information from your last
we don't want to hear anything from you. </s>

i was in a terrible mood the other day. </s>
but recent events have caused a <unk> <unk> </s>
i lost my mother. </s>
very sudden and... <unk> </s>
you're so <unk> <unk> </s>
it's a terrible <unk> to anyone who <unk> a mother. </s>
it was. </s>
it is. </s>
and it made me realize that i need to let it go. </s>
but i think you should know that i met a man. </s>
actually, i got it from <unk> </s>
you have no idea how <unk> it would be to marry you. </s>
if i had the chance to handle everything. </s>
i came to pay my <unk> </s>
i know i missed my chance. </s>
i'm not half the man you <unk> </s>
but i asked myself, </s>
<unk> what do you have to do to be there for the girls you love so much? </s>
and it occurred to me that i was <unk> you up, so i hired a decent man to <unk> the information about your new friend. </s>
and it breaks my heart, because your <unk> <unk> is a <unk> </s>
we don't need to see that. </s>
what's the matter with you? </s>
you're a pain in the ass. </s>
<unk> then. </s>
i did my best. </s>
my mother always told me not to discuss with a woman. </s>
who is it? </s>
kid. </s>

i'll show you something <unk> than a <unk> <unk> </s>
and more <unk> </s>

i don't think you should say it at all.
and i wouldn't play that song either. </s>
there's still ice. </s>
yeah, i know. </s>
it doesn't seem sad to me. </s>
it's your life, <unk> </s>
you never wanted someone to be emotionally <unk> on you, wondering how you are, where you are, kissing you in the morning, waiting for you to get home at night. </s>
what's good to wear these on your birthday? </s>

he was already a very happy man. </s>
that's not gonna stop him, <unk> </s>
you can walk with me. </s>
we can do the <unk> thing. </s>
honey, i'm not the right woman for you. </s>
you're so <unk> you're a great guy for fun. </s>
but no one is the right person for you, because you only think about yourself. </s>
what the hell was that? </s>
i think it was the inside of my head. </s>
i can't be a <unk> <unk> </s>
i think so. </s>
you know what the worst part is? </s>
i don't care about anyone but myself. </s>
it's really impossible for me to meet other people. </s>

perhaps you never had your own <unk> </s>
i believe that our <unk> happiness is the <unk> of the kind of people we want and the happiness that lives in this
they're also the most important <unk> of their lives because they're <unk> </s>
they do things for you, and they do it with <unk> </s>
or maybe i'm beginning to believe that there is a way for you to live only for yourself. </s>
i wasn't going to, but i think i need to sing a little song i wrote for this particular lady. </s>
well, aside from the <unk> part, your speech was really <unk> </s>
sometimes it's really hard to work with you. </s>

you can forget your <unk> </s>
i don't know why. </s>
i think you should remember the fun things you used to do and you should start making them
that's a good idea. </s>

i think you <unk> </s>

they're <unk> a system for us. </s>
you'll see. </s>

he's good for me, too. </s>
that was fun. </s>
listen, i hired someone to watch the house. </s>
the day will come. </s>
i can stay home until mom gets home. </s>

yeah, no problem. </s>
hey, <unk> </s>
you okay? </s>
<unk> </s>
you don't like <unk> <unk> </s>
aren't you <unk> </s>
yeah, i'm fine, <unk> </s>
i make my own bed now. </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
john bought me dinner <unk> </s>
he's like a real wife. </s>
just keep him alive until i get back. </s>
thanks for the <unk> </s>
mom looks good, doesn't she? </s>
yeah, great. </s>
i'm not going anywhere without my <unk> </s>
i meant your face, mom. </s>
<unk> </s>
what are you, a <unk> </s>
don't call me <unk> </s>
do i call you <unk> </s>
don't be so kind to my mother, <unk> </s>
don't listen to him. </s>
why are you <unk> </s>
there was food ready in the <unk> </s>
i told you. </s>
just a little <unk> that's all. </s>
you were in <unk> the other night. </s>
the night before that we had <unk> <unk> </s>
your father doesn't like foreign <unk> </s>
only the red <unk> <unk> </s>
he drinks red wine. </s>
mom, i was already here. </s>
i don't want him to have an <unk> while i'm here. </s>
nobody ever eats <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
calm down, <unk> </s>
it was worth it. </s>
i'm just here with <unk> and don't worry about me. </s>
you sure you want to come, dad? </s>
it's going to be a long meeting. </s>
no, i will. </s>
it'll do me good. </s>
i could buy you a lunch here, you could catch a movie. </s>
a <unk> <unk> </s>
i'll be fine. </s>
okay. </s>
john <unk> to see <unk> <unk> please. </s>
he's expecting you. </s>
dad, you think you can be comfortable here with all this <unk> </s>
of course, nobody wanted anything on me. </s>
john, good to see you. </s>
<unk> for <unk> </s>
nice to see you too, <unk> </s>
this is my father, jake <unk> </s>
dad, this is <unk> <unk> </s>
nice to meet you, mr. <unk> </s>
me too. </s>
we'll be here in an hour? </s>
like i said. </s>
okay, well, take care, dad. </s>
wait a minute, wait a minute. </s>
you can't leave your father here. </s>
mr. <unk> why don't you come in and sit with us? </s>
i can handle it. </s>
<unk> we've given you all we've <unk> and now our <unk> <unk> less than 20 percent of the <unk> </s>
how can you be so sure of yourself? </s>
<unk> never run a business like this before. </s>
and if you don't, we'll be <unk> <unk> and you'll be done with it. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
it <unk> every minute, but the property he's on is worth at least <unk> million. </s>
how can you be so sure of the 50 million <unk> </s>
we can offer him 40 million with a little <unk> </s>
do you have any <unk> </s>
can i see <unk> now? </s>
the real <unk> value is 50 million dollars and we have no problem with the <unk> around it. </s>
we have all the general <unk> but our best plan shows that the <unk> <unk> will be <unk> in a few months. </s>
aren't you enough to sell it? </s>
and that would explain the <unk> records. </s>
if this goes well, it won't be necessary. </s>
i don't think i can stand it. </s>
you can't do this. </s>
the next thing is food <unk> which is good <unk> </s>
now, <unk> has been <unk> with cash <unk> but not <unk> </s>
so we don't have a problem taking credit while we figure out everything. </s>
yeah, this looks good. </s>
johnny, what's going on in there? </s>
well, we're looking for a <unk> <unk> dad. </s>
i didn't know you had it in you. </s>
actually, i don't know. </s>
the guy who came to us for money doesn't know either. </s>
we're just gonna shut down the company, and then we're gonna stop the <unk> </s>
this your <unk> </s>
are you <unk> <unk> and then <unk> </s>
it's a little more complicated than that, dad. </s>
we take this <unk> from <unk> </s>
it <unk> after the company. </s>
this third act is <unk> and <unk> <unk> </s>
but we have a little <unk> <unk> and that's the key to it. </s>
<unk> is <unk> on a <unk> <unk> </s>
so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and then <unk> <unk> </s>
have you ever tried this <unk> <unk> </s>
there's no money in that, dad. </s>
the world has changed, johnny. </s>
how the world <unk> <unk> </s>
when you were a little girl, you used to go to work with me, remember? </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
you pay <unk> cents a day and you pay <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>

did you hear anything about those <unk> dad? </s>
rick <unk> </s>
tommy <unk> </s>
they all went to <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
there was no one there to say goodbye to me. </s>
next morning, <unk> didn't get me the job i did. </s>
the world belongs to two <unk> </s>
<unk> and <unk> </s>
i don't know, daddy, the <unk> </s>
it's all right, johnny. </s>
there's nothing wrong here. </s>
i'm a <unk> that's all. </s>
but you, you're different. </s>
you chose to be <unk> </s>
you like to take <unk> </s>
you're a <unk> </s>
mom? </s>
what do you think? </s>
okay, dad. </s>
"if you hit a parking <unk> you can <unk> the vehicle <unk> </s>

what are you talking about? </s>
that's my dad. </s>
those are the rules. </s>
i'm not gonna do the test until i get in the

she graduated high school. </s>
even the book was <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>

but john was a good <unk> </s>
thanks, <unk> </s>
i walk out of the <unk> every friday. </s>

if we can get them back to <unk> we can book four new books. </s>
you did more than that. </s>
so how does it work? </s>

somebody find this guy. </s>
i'm just happy. </s>
while you are here, we can work things out for <unk> and <unk> </s>

i'm sorry. </s>
so when do you have to be back at school? </s>
i'm going to school. </s>
i'm thinking of going away for a while. </s>
what's the <unk> <unk> </s>
all the <unk> came here to come. </s>
did you know that? </s>
there are some kids from school. </s>
we have very similar <unk> </s>
it's, uh, it's good. </s>

i'm going back to new york soon, and i want to put this right. </s>

i'm not sure how i feel about this. </s>
we need to talk more about this. </s>
i don't understand why. </s>
we've never talked about it before, and i know what i want. </s>
johnny, something's wrong. </s>
can you come here and take a look? </s>
that's enough, mr. <unk> </s>
if you want. </s>
is she okay? </s>
yeah, he's good. </s>
<unk> starts with a <unk> </s>
not yet. </s>
any idea what's wrong? </s>
it could be one of a few things. </s>
i suspect <unk> is <unk> </s>
the problem is whether they're good <unk> </s>
is that the <unk> you <unk> </s>
not at all. </s>
<unk> not a good sign. </s>
so this is serious? </s>
i think we should send him to a general <unk> </s>

this is exactly the same with the other <unk> </s>
<unk> are often <unk> after every simple <unk> </s>
is that it? </s>
any idea what happened in there? </s>
i know this is a scary experience for you, but what you have to understand is that what we're dealing with here. </s>
you can call when you get here. </s>
why are you crying now? </s>
<unk> strange <unk> </s>
it comes and goes. </s>
this kind of <unk> stress can <unk> <unk> </s>
i'm sure you're a pretty girl and <unk> condition is <unk> </s>
what do we do in the <unk> </s>
nothing. </s>
what do you mean, <unk> </s>
we wait for him to respond to the <unk> </s>
did you tell dad he has <unk> </s>
he has the right to know. </s>
i know exactly what you want from me, mr. <unk> </s>
dr. <unk> </s>
i don't trust <unk> </s>
you are the hospital <unk> and all i'm saying is that it <unk> us. </s>
dr. <unk> is a good young <unk> </s>
he seems to be very <unk> and <unk> about your father. </s>
i told him not to say anything about cancer to my father because he's very afraid of this <unk> </s>
but he went ahead and told him... </s>
yes, it's difficult for a doctor to say. </s>
he has to ensure your father's <unk> rights will be <unk> in the family <unk> </s>
i'm sure he had no choice. </s>
i had a <unk> </s>
don't listen to me. </s>
i know my father. </s>
why are you <unk> your <unk> </s>
for you to hurt yourself. </s>
you can keep your <unk> to yourself. </s>
well then, i am his <unk> and i believe he doesn't need them. </s>
let us know when you're ready, and we'll have him <unk> </s>
i can't believe it. </s>
hey, dad, how's it going? </s>

look, hey, look, look, i brought <unk> </s>
and <unk> here. </s>
hey, dad. </s>
how are you feeling, dad? </s>
can you hear me? </s>
hey, <unk> it's me, billy. </s>
how's it going? </s>
god, john, i can't stand to see him looking like this. </s>
i think that's enough. </s>
i gave him a <unk> </s>
that would destroy him. </s>
how long has he been like that? </s>
the whole time we've been here. </s>
<unk> </s>
jesus, doctor. </s>
i'm glad you're not a detective. </s>
yeah, he seemed <unk> </s>
what the hell is going on here? </s>
i meant more than <unk> mr. <unk> </s>
mr. <unk> </s>
you keep telling me he's <unk> <unk> doctor. </s>
this <unk> is not the <unk> <unk> but the <unk> will bring him around. </s>
<unk> </s>
the man is <unk> </s>
the guy <unk> on and on. </s>
he doesn't know anyone in his family, and you just gave him a <unk> </s>
why didn't you tell him about <unk> </s>
maybe you should ask <unk> </s>
we decided to <unk> your father tomorrow. </s>
you can pick him up after <unk> </s>
what do you mean, <unk> </s>
are you trying to tell me that my father has <unk> </s>
well, of course not, but <unk> speaking there's nothing more we can do for him. </s>
we cannot hold <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> </s>
how are you feeling? </s>
no help from a <unk> </s>
what exactly do you mean? </s>
whatever you say. </s>
so it wasn't even <unk> who died. </s>
what kind of speech is that? </s>
take that off. </s>
just take it easy. </s>
you want my father out of here? </s>
look what i'm gonna do. </s>
i'll do better than you do. </s>
you're not good enough to take care of him. </s>
john, what are you doing? </s>
mr. <unk> don't believe him. </s>
that's not necessary. </s>
i say we bring him home. </s>
mr. <unk> this is <unk> </s>
what do we do now? </s>
i don't know. </s>
we don't have much choice, but <unk> </s>
no, i don't want to do that. </s>
i don't want to take him to a <unk> </s>
me too, john, but we have to do something. </s>

you can't help him in this condition. </s>
i think i can do this. </s>
i can do better than <unk> </s>
i'll stay and help. </s>

why not? </s>
i'll take care of her. </s>
he's my father. </s>
well, he's my <unk> </s>
and i'm your father. </s>
i don't want you here right now, billy. </s>
you can't do this. </s>
dad, i'm not a kid. </s>

go back to school, go back to mexico. </s>
you're out of here. </s>
<unk> </s>
yeah, i got it. </s>
i want to talk to him. </s>
i don't think that's a good idea now, mom, really. </s>
<unk> right, mom. </s>
have a <unk> </s>
you'd like that, wouldn't you, <unk> </s>
i meant <unk> mom. </s>
it's just a language <unk> </s>

hmm, okay. </s>

come on, there you go. </s>
let's try the <unk> </s>
dad, don't throw things out the window. </s>
the lady of the house. </s>

neither do i. </s>
sleep well, huh? </s>
come on, dad. </s>
that's better. </s>
okay, dad. </s>
hang on a second, and i'll kill you. </s>
let me grab these and i'll be right back.
why are you <unk> <unk> </s>
why are you <unk> <unk> </s>
what? </s>
you know, if you're worried about your wife, don't worry. </s>
where's the <unk> </s>
it's your <unk> dad. </s>
what are you talking about? </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
i'm worried about her. </s>
well, don't worry, dad. </s>
<unk> sure she's okay. </s>
you think so? </s>
it is. </s>
help me with the 18 <unk> for the <unk> </s>
it needs to be done now. </s>
look. </s>
what we need now is a good night's sleep. </s>
you were always a problem, <unk> <unk> </s>
get down on the <unk> </s>
i mean, you got <unk> now, dad. </s>
let's sit on it. </s>
dad? </s>
dad? </s>
dad? </s>
dad, where are you? </s>
dad? </s>
dad? </s>
dad? </s>
dad? </s>
what do you think you're doing here? </s>
oh, dad, come on, i'll help you out. </s>
come here, daddy, come on. </s>
no. </s>
dad, i'm gonna make the bed. </s>
get out. </s>
come on, dad, get out. </s>
dad, come on. </s>
i got you. </s>
<unk> </s>
come on. </s>
<unk> </s>
i got you, i got you. </s>
i got you. </s>
mr. <unk> </s>
<unk> i understand you're going back to the hospital. </s>
yeah. </s>
i thought it'd be hard to give her the <unk> </s>
it's really not the place for her right now. </s>
it could have been at home, could have been here, right? </s>
perhaps you'd better ask a <unk> <unk> </s>
i know how kids say <unk> <unk> </s>
you know what that means. </s>
i know what <unk> is. </s>
mr. <unk> <unk> that <unk> are human. </s>
we can handle all our problems. </s>
every <unk> <unk> </s>
we live in a <unk> where old people eventually meet their <unk> </s>
what's your name? </s>
why are you <unk> </s>
there's another doctor here at the hospital. </s>
i think he can do better than dr. <unk> </s>
what? </s>
i'm <unk> everything that's said. </s>
he's a good man. </s>
i want a copy of her <unk> </s>
mr. <unk> </s>
mr. <unk> </s>
<unk> mr. <unk> </s>
let's do some <unk> </s>
let's get a <unk> and figure out which ones are <unk> </s>
order <unk> and <unk> vital <unk> </s>
i'm not sure what caused it, but right now, i'm <unk> to say it's a <unk> </s>
the question is, what caused it? </s>
and why no <unk> </s>
if you want to have another <unk> on this, please do so. </s>
no, that won't be necessary. </s>
well, having said that don't get the impression that we're going to sit by and do nothing.
<unk> </s>
we've just done a series of tests and we'll do more. </s>
it's just that right now, we're really shooting in the <unk> </s>
i appreciate your <unk> doctor. </s>
but those tests took a long time, didn't they? </s>
if we stay here a while, <unk> will be able to <unk> him at any moment. </s>
and i'll check in and see him twice a day. </s>
all the way to the <unk> </s>
i'm afraid that's entirely against hospital <unk> </s>
how long do you think you can keep this up? </s>
i don't know. </s>
i'm leaving once a day. </s>
<unk> </s>
i'm talking to him. </s>
i talk to people who come and go. </s>
i was thinking if i lived there and died over there, he could die. </s>
what are you gonna do with <unk> </s>
<unk> it's <unk> </s>
you're the only one who can stop it, john. </s>
why don't you take her to the <unk> </s>
i can't explain it to you. </s>
maybe i should be there when it ends. </s>
i don't know. </s>
to prove he's still here. </s>
to prove i was his son. </s>
what more could you possibly have done? </s>
<unk> this guy got up every day of his life and went to a job he didn't like. </s>
i never touched her. </s>
he did it because he was <unk> and he had no choice. </s>
he never asked himself if he was happy or happy. </s>
i didn't even know if he had the right. </s>
and when you get past this <unk> you can touch it, you can touch it. </s>
but i <unk> it. </s>
john. </s>
i <unk> him, but my mother <unk> him. </s>
i can't talk right now. </s>
i married you because i have a job in <unk> <unk> and i have a son who barely <unk> the <unk> </s>
maybe this will be hard for me </s>
but i'll be there when he dies. </s>
and i'm gonna find him, and i'm gonna cover him. </s>
and i'm gonna change the gold at the moment. </s>
i owe him that. </s>
when did you get in town? </s>
i've never been. </s>
i'm staying with some friends. </s>
i didn't want to leave <unk> </s>
you come here every day? </s>
when you left, a nurse calls me. </s>
i've been standing at least half an hour. </s>
i'm <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> dad. </s>
i understand that. </s>
why are you here? </s>
was there a car accident or a <unk> </s>
he <unk> </s>
yes, it does. </s>
don't act like a child. </s>
go, uh, get this to dr. <unk> </s>
please, please. </s>
why are you looking so nice to me? </s>
uh, <unk> part of the hospital, dad. </s>
<unk> uh, a <unk> </s>
this is <unk> this is <unk> uh, this is <unk> </s>
that's my dad. </s>
okay, mr. <unk> </s>
how can i leave you alone? </s>
<unk> those <unk> with the <unk> <unk> </s>
then i better say something. </s>
are you gonna starve me to death here? </s>
okay, we need to get some <unk> </s>
remember, you haven't eaten in a long time. </s>
maybe that's why you're here. </s>
you can't do that, <unk> </s>
all tests are <unk> vital <unk> </s>
and this is a healthy human being. </s>
i've seen people <unk> before. </s>
usually i don't understand why. </s>
i have some questions about that. </s>
that <unk> <unk> </s>
like what? </s>
how are we supposed to get rid of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and talk about it? </s>
i see. </s>
you know, when we got home, they were all in this <unk> </s>
but it was <unk> and it was your <unk> and your job to <unk> <unk> </s>
i think it's better this way. </s>
me too. </s>
they're here. </s>
what's going on, dad? </s>
what are you looking for? </s>
your mother and i are starting a new life together, johnny. </s>
we need new <unk> </s>
i don't know, dad. </s>
what do you think mom would say about all this? </s>
she probably looked at me and called me crazy, but she was <unk> </s>
i haven't been home in ten years. </s>
how about that? </s>
thank you. </s>
thank you, thank you. </s>
ladies, ladies, the <unk> begins. </s>
no matter how <unk> you feel during the <unk> the <unk> are <unk> </s>

i think i'm gonna have to do this at home. </s>
actually, i was gonna go see a couple of <unk> but it's not <unk> </s>
that's good to hear, jake. </s>
wait. </s>
there's one more. </s>
i won't ask you again. </s>
oh, <unk> <unk> </s>
don't listen to them. </s>
<unk> </s>
i never knew anyone who died in <unk> </s>
but wouldn't that be great? </s>
i tell you, johnny, he's not the same. </s>
maybe i should get a <unk> <unk> </s>
you know what goes on in <unk> </s>
nobody would believe he's a <unk> man who almost died a few weeks ago. </s>
i'm serious about meeting someone. </s>
mom, it's just a <unk> </s>
the only hole is <unk> but the <unk> </s>
it's a great day. </s>
after the <unk> they take us somewhere. </s>
that's a good idea. </s>
maybe mom will come along with us. </s>
you put her in the car. </s>
you've moved too fast before. </s>
i hate to think what she loves right now. </s>
don't worry about your pretty little head, <unk> </s>
you'll be safe from <unk> old jake <unk> </s>
and this is gonna be fun. </s>
what are you doing on the <unk> </s>
nothing. </s>
i want to see if i can still take a <unk> </s>
i call it a <unk> man. </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
are you coming to the <unk> </s>
i'm coming, but only with a cab. </s>
i don't want to go to <unk> </s>
i think we're going <unk> in santa <unk> </s>

35 years ago. </s>
i'll go get them. </s>
she'll be fine. </s>
johnny, i'm scared. </s>
he's talking about people i don't even know, or people i'm sure are dead. </s>
he says we live in a country in new york, and he's gonna take us there because it's time to get up. </s>
what? </s>
dad. </s>

what's going on? </s>
take me for a ride. </s>
john, i need to talk. </s>
johnny, </s>

i don't think there's a chance, dad. </s>
isn't there a chance there might be some sort of <unk> </s>
i don't have four kids there? </s>
you, <unk> hank and little <unk> </s>
as far as i know, dad, you've been living in los angeles for <unk> years.
<unk> you had a regular job until you <unk> </s>
and before that, we lived in <unk> and we worked there for <unk> </s>
i know you're right. </s>
i mean, how can you be in two places at once? </s>
i just want to say, <unk> my life is like here, </s>
just sitting around watching <unk> </s>
stop me if this gets too technical or too <unk> </s>
<unk> is a <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> </s>
over the years, he was <unk> enough with his daily life, and <unk> the <unk> of his <unk> </s>
<unk> was more of a man than life. </s>
how long has this been going on? </s>
hard to say now. </s>
at least 20 years, maybe more. </s>
incredible. </s>
you have to understand, in order to do that, it takes an extremely <unk> <unk> <unk> and emotional <unk> </s>
so what's my mother's place in all this? </s>
did she just leave these? </s>
you're <unk> </s>
she's very <unk> very sweet. </s>
isn't that the most important thing in the world? </s>
he's got <unk> </s>
the real problem is your father's <unk> in this world. </s>
ever since he killed himself, he's been a happy person. </s>
his two <unk> were <unk> <unk> </s>
and he's brought into his daily lives by keeping him away for years. </s>
if your mother doesn't go along with him, he's going to <unk> <unk> </s>
hello, all the nice people here. </s>
maybe i can do some <unk> on the bike path. </s>
what would people think if they saw you like this? </s>

that's all. </s>
i don't believe you, it's just a story. </s>
a great dream and a great dream. </s>
my father knows how to <unk> two worlds now. </s>

you were captain of the <unk> team, weren't you? </s>
at least you tried. </s>
the one where you buy <unk> <unk> to impress you. </s>
i'm so proud of you. </s>
never hurts to be ready. </s>
if you think <unk> can help you, why not? </s>
i was kidding. </s>

i mean, i... </s>
was i that <unk> </s>
i don't think the others noticed. </s>
still, the last thing any of us should be doing is <unk> with each other. </s>
office <unk> even under normal <unk> </s>
we live under normal circumstances. </s>
what are the odds of any of us finding someone who can deal with the stuff that we have to deal
i don't know, maybe <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
you wanted to be alone, actually. </s>
tell him you don't like him. </s>
this murder happened a week ago. </s>
why are you telling me this now? </s>
how did you get these? </s>
the police gave them to you? </s>
most people who are <unk> are <unk> </s>
he said she <unk> him. </s>
i'm trying to make him understand. </s>
well, it worked. </s>
<unk> <unk> 20 minutes ago, look who's here. </s>
what? </s>
okay, he's nice. </s>
and who's that? </s>
are you sure it's him? </s>
i saw one of my <unk> <unk> in her face. </s>
yeah, that's him. </s>
now we know why the <unk> gave me the death of the woman. </s>
she died because of me. </s>
<unk> if he's somehow <unk> then so am i. </s>
<unk> </s>
hey. </s>
whatever he's doing right now, you're not responsible for this, and neither am i. </s>
but i know who you are. </s>
a little <unk> <unk> </s>
long day at the office. </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
i didn't write that. </s>
i know he has some power that <unk> </s>
billy never touched me, and you believed him. </s>
this <unk> is the most important part of the country. </s>
east <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> wouldn't do anything to them. </s>
it's not like some kind of <unk> <unk> </s>
stay out of trouble. </s>
i don't think <unk> <unk> would be very good. </s>
what do you say we break in like a <unk> </s>
all right, you wanna go next? </s>
i think we're safe here. </s>
why didn't you call me if you weren't invited in? </s>
as far as i'm concerned, we have <unk> <unk> </s>
i've never kissed a woman in my life. </s>
i just love <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
really? </s>
you scared me. </s>
we're taking you in for <unk> </s>
<unk> read him his rights. </s>
who are you? </s>
nobody. </s>
there's a woman who never liked to show you her <unk> </s>
yeah, a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
yeah, but for how long? </s>
an <unk> <unk> of <unk> in a demon <unk> couldn't do much, so my guess, regular <unk> not really a problem. </s>
<unk> what are you gonna do? </s>
you can't just <unk> into a police station. </s>
there's been an accident. </s>
i asked him what the <unk> woman did to <unk> <unk> </s>
i don't think it's a bad idea to have a call when you're visiting <unk> patient in the hospital.
<unk> some of the blood is his. </s>
not human. </s>
he's headed this way. </s>
i'll take a sample and see what sort of person billy is. </s>
i'm gonna run an <unk> </s>
<unk> daily <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
i don't think you should do this. </s>
how are you feeling? </s>
i managed to get <unk> blood <unk> </s>
maybe we can figure out which demon <unk> and figure out how the <unk> work. </s>
could you hand me the glass <unk> </s>
thank you. </s>
are you going to invite me in? </s>
please, come in. </s>
i want you to tell me about <unk> </s>
<unk> tell <unk> everything. </s>
what makes you think i'd do that? </s>
after all, it's your fault. </s>
i understand immediately. </s>
i don't take sides. </s>
<unk> feels responsible for this guy because he brought him back to <unk> </s>
i feel responsible because he did it to save me. </s>
in fact, you're totally responsible for this, because you're a <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> is not fashion this summer. </s>
billy <unk> <unk> people. </s>
then why are you <unk> <unk> </s>
others can take hours. </s>
god, i hope <unk> isn't feeling <unk> </s>
really <unk> </s>
i have to find <unk> </s>
and i can't help you, why? </s>
do you remember the guy who hired <unk> to get in? </s>
you know, what he did to me was <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
it's about <unk> </s>
there's certainly something you can do to stop this. </s>
that your life can suddenly be destroyed by someone else. </s>
and no woman strong enough to break the <unk> of <unk> <unk> </s>
where's <unk> </s>
i understand why <unk> have done this. </s>
there's a reason, am i right? </s>
how many times do you want to talk about <unk> <unk> </s>
did i wake you? </s>
probably sitting in the back telling him how to drive. </s>
you know this <unk> </s>
you probably deserved it. </s>
as i was saying... </s>
<unk> <unk> here. </s>
hey, <unk> </s>
billy. </s>
i didn't know you were having a party. </s>
we agreed that you weren't gonna come here anymore after that last thing. </s>
do you want to, or should i? </s>
it looks as if some of the <unk> are <unk> </s>
these are probably from the <unk> demon <unk> </s>
so <unk> looks like he's been trying to <unk> people to death. </s>
which means it could be <unk> by <unk> or even by <unk> </s>
where is <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
when <unk> came out with <unk> you thought she was going out because you slept with her. </s>
well, i <unk> </s>
lie to me again and we're gonna have a problem. </s>
sit down, <unk> </s>
there's something we need to talk about. </s>
i'm sorry i didn't tell you <unk> left. </s>
we still have to make some changes around here. </s>
change can be good, i guess. </s>
no more of these <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
maybe your mom and dad never told you about what grown men go after in <unk> </s>
you can't come in here all the time, you can't talk like that.
he really forced me to take him. </s>
is that what you want? </s>
stop it. </s>
are we standing now? </s>
you <unk> your hair back and close your eyes and then join us in the <unk> <unk> </s>
you think you can do anything you want to because you <unk> </s>
no. </s>
i'll show you blood. </s>
what do you say to a woman with two <unk> </s>
nothing you already said twice. </s>
no sense of humor. </s>
to be honest, i'm calling to kill that <unk> </s>
come in. </s>
you should know the rules about billy. </s>
<unk> everybody knows the rules. </s>
you leave your girlfriend alone with him alone, and don't let him touch you. </s>
he wants money, leave it on the table and <unk> </s>
can you explain something to me? </s>
why did you invite me in after you said i wanted to kill <unk> </s>
you're <unk> right? </s>
billy mention me? </s>
she said a <unk> guy named <unk> would eventually come here. </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
i know what you're doing. </s>
and who he is. </s>
you scared me. </s>
he forced me to find you. </s>
it's like a <unk> game. </s>

but you never give up, do you? </s>
no, you just keep <unk> and <unk> </s>
guess what, <unk> i'm not one of the new <unk> </s>
i'm a <unk> </s>

i'm here to take you back. </s>
i mean, of course, you women are one of those who sell yourself for money and <unk> but men are just as bad. </s>
maybe even worse. </s>
the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> </s>
i'm wearing pants. </s>
actually, i was just jealous because i had an arrow in my hand. </s>
and the <unk> of using a <unk> <unk> </s>
i don't think so. </s>
you don't have the guts to do this. </s>
don't start that again. </s>
you won't hurt me. </s>
no, i won't hurt her. </s>
i won't hurt her. </s>
over here. </s>
i would say that <unk> hand <unk> was <unk> </s>
that <unk> <unk> downstairs is <unk> blood? </s>
you mean when i take it and shake hands with my hands, it's a crazy <unk> </s>
it <unk> me when you feel that way. </s>
i'd better get out of here. </s>
lock the door behind me. </s>

hi. </s>
<unk> what are you doing here? </s>
<unk> doesn't work without you. </s>
you don't belong here. </s>
why? </s>
i can't help you, fool. </s>
there's less <unk> </s>
don't pay them. </s>
why would you pay for sex? </s>
you can't have someone who really loves you. </s>
i don't want to love anyone, okay? </s>
to find the right person. </s>
i'm not right for anyone, <unk> </s>
come on. </s>
<unk> i'm <unk> okay? </s>
i like men, don't you see? </s>
go away! </s>
go! </s>
why? </s>
i can't hear you. </s>
remember when you'd get home late and i'd pretend i was asleep and you'd fuck me anyway? </s>
yeah, i remember. </s>
i saw <unk> today. </s>
you know, normal life. </s>
okay. </s>
it'll give me something to do tomorrow. </s>
<unk> i'll be right in. </s>
you want <unk> </s>
i want you to come to bed with me. </s>
and i'm telling you i'm going to clean up first. </s>
<unk> </s>
doesn't <unk> help you deal with your brother? </s>
<unk> thinks only of themselves and perfect <unk> </s>
all they do is fuck all day long. </s>
<unk> </s>
don't blame yourself, <unk> </s>
i found rat <unk> in <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> if you believe in <unk> </s>
all kinds of <unk> <unk> </s>
come on, put it away. </s>
a <unk> </s>
come on. </s>
and one for me. </s>
good, isn't it? </s>
you looked different when you were a kid. </s>
<unk> doesn't like football games or anything like that. </s>
because if you're fat and <unk> no one can explain to you why you're so <unk> </s>
nobody will notice i'm gay. </s>
but i didn't give in to my <unk> until the special <unk> </s>
they let me <unk> <unk> </s>
and they gave me a <unk> </s>
there was this incredibly handsome <unk> who begged me to let her down because she didn't have <unk> </s>
i don't know which made me happier the way it is, the way it <unk> the way it <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> or when it
the first <unk> a <unk> </s>
i'm done being gay. </s>
really. </s>
we're supposed to be <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
and that's not me. </s>
i can't wait all night for <unk> </s>
go. </s>
you have to pay anyway. </s>
i'm a <unk> </s>
the worst <unk> of all time. </s>
a <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
i'm a <unk> </s>
<unk> aren't supposed to be bad. </s>
i always get in touch with something when i'm ready. </s>
that's why it's better not to run from them, but to face them and see where they lead us. </s>
because in most <unk> the answers we seek are <unk> </s>
put your hands behind your back. </s>
close your eyes. </s>
let's all breathe together. </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
breathe, breathe. </s>
i thought it was <unk> but it was wrong. </s>
we all have <unk> </s>
the first step to <unk> what we want or don't want to <unk> </s>
i was gonna call you, but i was gonna tell <unk>
i didn't go back in there on purpose. </s>
i'm <unk> </s>
what you <unk> but don't <unk> </s>
you can run, but i can't protect you. </s>
i warned you, but you didn't listen. </s>
i warned you, but you didn't listen. </s>
what is it you love but you <unk> </s>
are you doing it because you want to, or because you want to act like everything's <unk> </s>
society wants you to be fat. </s>
everyone will feel better if they <unk> because they'll feel <unk> </s>
not anymore. </s>
it's time to take that first step. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
one move, <unk> </s>
but one day of <unk> isn't enough, one bottle of <unk> isn't enough. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
it gives you the support you need on the long, hard road to <unk> </s>
believe me, there's only one way to find out. </s>
let's move on to step 3. </s>
<unk> pure and clear. </s>
<unk> pounds. </s>
<unk> </s>
14 pounds of <unk> </s>
once again, <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
should we find ourselves a <unk> <unk> or a <unk> <unk> or a <unk> bird in the <unk> </s>
i don't like big <unk> </s>
let's see. </s>
<unk> higher than <unk> </s>
not <unk> but careful. </s>
you could be a <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
it's not weird after <unk> </s>
don't worry, <unk> </s>
everything's gonna be all right. </s>
just watch your step. </s>
you were always with that girl. </s>
what did you say? </s>
nothing. </s>
what are you doing, <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> body <unk> <unk> </s>
a sample of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for <unk> <unk> </s>
years ago, this <unk> would have been <unk> </s>
today this <unk> will be <unk> in less than 24 hours. </s>
so i'm half the <unk> </s>
