michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, the person he shared his bed was his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think we both fit together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i'll tell him.
i need to write a trial of at least 000 words pertaining to the morality of war and a firefight.
i'm not sure my ethics teacher would like me to cheat when i write the essay.
then you passed my moral test.
in fact, gorgeorgorgicemichélichéthai bethbaerly's delicate teacher, hopelessly burned.
even small offenders can be brutally cut by the hand.
he doesn't have no ring ring ring
try to remember everything he said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
the d.d.k.' s on us.
your father thought it would make us look better.
he must have faked my signature.
'and i'll have a son who'll finish his skimming cheese a year ago!
you gotta get me out of this.
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't look at him either.
i don't have a mother's compassion and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls... a couple of fun girls... a
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm offering you an olive branch here.
yes, yes.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
meanwhile, lindsay was doing george michael's homework.
why do i tell you this?
i guess it's because there's some things that a man can't tell his father.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set up his teacher... so he could fulfill his mother's duty.
there's nothing wrong with that.
however, i must say that i'm a little upset because you don't think about me for that.
aunt hale can do that assignment.
teachers can fill that role.
sure, someday, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until they do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay had never been more proud of what she'd said her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i keep telling you about.
she's really... young girl.
it's your date, nazh... nazh... nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma, you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache.
yeah.
but gob has misunderstood the emotional attention that michael was kindly gracious about... and felt a competition to interfere.
'cause, you know, beyond loving... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
_
and george sr.' s about to have a surprise visit.
i've read all your teachings and got all your tapes.
and i watched it all over again.
george sr. had recently presented a series of tapes of his suggestions... in order to earn money from the new spiritual outreach to the people he had just discovered.
i also lost two pounds by eating your banana bluth jail bars.
i came to find out where.
this is a nice place to start.
and after michael got rid of two girls he was dating, he met lindsay at parent-teacher night.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this rape room have the same plan as our kitchen?
i think she's really nice to you.
i thought it would get her to get the maternal concept out of her mind.
besides, i can't rush into a job like this just because my son wants to get married to someone.
i'm mrs. baerly, the ethics teacher.
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of the life that could be lost by the impulsiveness of an unthinkable trigger.
and michael got to know his son's ethics teacher.
that's the "rrrrrräd of that situation.
you know, it's frustrating.
i mean, after mr. daniels had a stroke, they gave me this class.
i thought you were kidding.
no, i was just laughing because you were laughing.
irrrrrrrrrrrp.
but, you know, it, it's just, you know,
and i think i'm a moral human being.
yeah.
a moral question to you.
can a parent teacher invite you for a drink?
or... or... or... or... or
yeah, he's dead.
i think it's this mr. daniels' stroke of mr. daniels' stroke... thing i'm guessing about
let's go have a drink.
well, maybe it'll help.
george sr. was working on his own fan.
i've already told you a lot of sin.
maybe you could tell me some of your sins.
well, there are lawyers showing my sins.
but, back to your sins.
tell one of the things about this thing... one of the things that happened at the college dorm again.
and what's going on with the second date with michael today on his date with misserly...?
michael, this little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it's him.
you're gonna have to strip him down to his underpants to say a definite thing.
yes, mom.
they'll get him back.
don't take your shoes off, mister!
don't take your shoes off!
it's out of control.
who is it?
it's " bannongg, mrs. daddy and i were adopted.
what, i'm leaving for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille realized buster was worried, maybe jealous.
and he knew what it felt like to be ignored.
annyong is your brother now your brother your brother now, annong
cancel it.
he's staying.
listen, i'll call you back later.
it was nice driving.
you making dinner reservations?
a blessing went to korea.
and after their dates... and after their meeting.
michael took a step he hadn't taken in years.
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think that's a great idea.
mm.
that's a great idea.
but how do we sneak in without waking everyone up?
this might not be the best idea i've ever had.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but it looks like we're even.
you took someone i loved.
i got you one you liked.
"nashbagerlajam. "
listen, i know you're trying to get even with me about marta.
i was lying to you when i said i wasn't going to try to get to her, so... so... so... so... so...
he has to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
really, lucky for me, i got rid of him.
it's okay.
it's so romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden? "
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but first i need to say i don't know if it's real.
but, now... your moral teacher... is... your next moral teacher... is... but
yeah, i did that for him.
oh.
she loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, for the subject, i'm sure you're interested in him.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show him that i care about him.
about his class?
i mean, i mean, he loved her... my loyalty... to him...
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with her.
well, why did he do that?
why did he sleep with my ethics teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new... the new... the gob... the new... the
he's not one of the good shooters that makes his mark, and he's about to shoot everywhere.
you know, but, listen, did you really think it was...?
i mean, he's old for you, don't you think he's old?
we don't even know how old he is.
nobody knows.
she was chaperoning the strange dance... and i thought maybe i'd go up to her and, uh, make her a joke and, uh... well, you know... well
"essam, would you like to dance, would you like to dance-up-
and that's what i thought you were gonna say, " what the hell, you know? "
i've done it differently in front of the mirror, but... but...
but, you know, we were, uh, dancing with a joke or doing something.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should date someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've analyzed a book that's hard to find a picture of saddam's bath suite.
" what would my brother do? "
yeah.
yeah, you know anything?
okay, that's the same as our fire escape.
in prison, george sr. was preparing for the evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon was making their own preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael is still angry at gob's... and he's looking for a family expert to create a problem with him.
i know you're dating shannon.
that cheerleader?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid, stupid, stupid
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and asked him... but he was breathing, and he dropped the phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe i should go together.
that's right, i mean, it was a bad example... it was a bad influence.
hello.
my mother took him.
he's making me book him into school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the george michael situation with ms. bearly.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in him.
i want to talk to you about that.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality... if you want to talk about yourself
you see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, he's, like, in love, like, in love, so... so... so... so...
he knows we're out.
i told him you were sleeping with my brother.
this could be the most unnatural thing i've ever heard of in my life.
well, you've only been a ethical teacher for half a semester.
look, it was a preliminary move.
my brother was gonna try to sleep with you.
so, i want to leave you right now, and i'm not going back to you.
i understand.
from now on.
george sr. went for a walk with cindi.
george.
and he's getting to know her.
you can totally spill your inside to me here.
it's weighing on my soul.
you, you... you, you... you
he's pulling the camera.
i'm taking him to the dance, and this is your dinner, so it's off with my mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy.
watch your back, my little migrant little brother!
and the spices were in the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting him in because he doesn't have your perfectly shaped nose, an apartment-shaped eye-shaped jaw because he doesn't have a strong square jaw.
you wanna dance?
all right!
gob finally found the shannon he was looking for... who he wanted shannon
gobun found out he was cheating on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i ruined our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about this for a while, and-and-and... and-and-and
this... is your right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yes, with my ethics teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
after you've been so horrible to you, you've really been able to protect me.
actually, gob mistook michael's ethical teacher... for a domestic information teacher.
man, he... he understands the type.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a homicidal teacher.
second move.
i was seeing ms. baerly, and i should never have brought gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked him, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to this.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed at some sad things, but... but... but... uh... we just.
i don't think we're gonna have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm taking that cake.
hey, you wanna dance?
i can't believe this is working.
she's on the next one at the camelopment.
buster's scam gets mad.
stop, stop, stop, stop!
we're not allowed to have candles here.
my mother is going crazy.
no, it's okay.
i light my own candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
it's okay.
right, let me help you out here.
these?
okay, i'll move it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is something really extreme.
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we're all going one day, right?
four months ago, each of you attended an interview, to attend a never-before-seen tv show.
and guess what?
you win.
i guess some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, like the sun.
hey, i'm randall, and i'm a total homosexual and i'm proud of it.
you're a sweetheart, aren't you?
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel, from england.
me too.
he's my brother, stanton, my probation officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him over the head.
he doesn't know.
but i do.

they seem like barack obama these days.
each of you will earn $ 00,000.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
damn!
cool.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know this isn't a prank?
right.
this is our third show, but we're not gonna publish it until the fall.
you're gonna have to play and earn the money to see if this donkey joke is a joke or not.
you'll be asked to perform a series of missions.
the duties will challenge your borders, your courage and your imagination.
that sounds fun, doesn't it?
what kind of assignment, man?
make up your mind now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i didn't have a girlfriend who would admit it when she was high on her mind.
i need to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you're nuts.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
stick around.
you'll find out.
the total will be divided equally between the survivors, but if you all make it through the night, there's a rich prize for you.
no money can make me spend the night here.
anyone else wanna join him?
not me.
there's no way i'm going all the way to the city with this pissed-
i'm in.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you're an idiot.
this is a fucking party joke, and they're gonna fuck all of you.
you're nothing but a bunch of morons.
can't you see this is a party that was taken on the record.
or become famous.
there's a human head!
don't worry, it's not real.
looks pretty real to me.
that's why they're calling our business " special effect on s.u.p.i.p.d.
lovely, isn't it?
it's a small sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thank you for our bounty special effects team.
follow me, fellas.
in the hot swamp water, lazy crocodiles are waiting for their prey.
the indian crocodiles become long and selfish.
such is the gators... such as the gators... such

we're all set.
and totally.
keep it up.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great that you scared them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are going to be in the show.
you really looked like you were scared.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really gives me the creeps.
did you know that?
the dead homeless?
sure.
why didn't you say anything?
it's probably a big coincidence.
you really think it's safe there?
it's safe enough for the show to be insured.
any other questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's get this over with.
okay.
we're skating.
each of you were chosen by your own free will, to spend the night in prison to earn $ 00,000.
it's clear enough, isn't it?
all right, let's get this party started.
you can find whatever you need in your main camp, it's the principal's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you've got all the above us, how can we write?
go down the corridor, right turn, right turn, right again, then left.
go straight to the stairs, to the left, right, and one more left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
you'll find a key there to get rid of your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll see about that.
i thought going out the basement was terrible.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to the mission.
can you just not do that?
i can't see a damn thing here.
anyone remember where we're going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, straight, twice right, then left.
there was a lot of flat goings.
no, go straight down the hall, down the hall, down the hall, down the
" turn right, do it again, and left.
" rays straight up the stairs, straight up,
"sola, right, and turn left again.
what are you?
smart.
illet will be a great show.

careful.
oh, god.
what is this place?
and get ready.
it was fun.
let's speed them up a little.
okay, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
it's running low, the generator should have kicked in by now.
damn it!
hurry!
weird, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's freezing in here.
look, the key.

"elam brave contestants.
" welcome to the bureau of clem harvis.
" there's a box in the middle of the room.
" the chess pieces will determine your personal role.
" you can't trade with other contestants.
" the juggings were his favorites.
" now it's your turn to put your hand in the fuckin' to put it in the box, you
shit.
well, who wants first?
i.
what's going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black rook.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
damn!
that was really fucking crazy.
welcome to the mission, my little pigs.
now let me tell you about pennyville state prison.
in the time of 0000, when the cost went up, the ruthless commissioner decided to raise his fortune by destroying certain expenses.
they were prisoners!
by the time the director was exposed, 00 prisoners were already executed.
last time the death sentence here was commissioner harvis himself.
rumor has it, the director's still walking around the halls.
you will be asked to face the director tonight and face the tortured souls under this building.
first assignment.
white queen.
try not to die!
anybody want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
" the white queen must go to the prison church to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first hallway.
that sounds great.
thank you.
damn it!
what?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see a thing.
okay, take it easy, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung the babies!
children... children... children... children... children
i guess they rigged it all with a speakerphone.
the voices are more effective than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
god!
that sounds lovely.
no, i'm fine, man.
freak.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
there's a sound.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're shouting from speakerphone, randall.
really.
okay.
what the... what the... what the...
nice set.
they want you to turn off the flashlight.
okay, now what?
open the page marked from the bible...
" you will find the lord's prayer.
" before 00 years ago, the sacred place has been disrespectful to this place,
" and now, this is a dense chamber of unusual events.
oh, my... it's the other way around things.
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do that.
" when you complete tolerance... "
" if a sign from the warden,
" you can go back to your camp. "
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry for who i'm bothering.
it wasn't my idea.
okay.
" protect the evil from evil...
" our father... our father in the precincts... "
" do not let the temptation rule us.
" protect the crops from overstepping... "
" forgive those who owe us, forgive us our debts.
" give us this day our daily bread.
" like the one in the darknet...
" like in the mug,
" for thy kingdom and dominion is yours.
please tell me i can go now.
"be before we head for camping.... "
jesus, randall, you have to put out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look what they're made for money.
where'd he go?
from what i understand, the people who did this job, they cut off our relationship with homo friend for a little while to get a more creepy air into the business.
whatever.
sure, it's gone in the click.
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, dude, it's not that bad.
it's definitely not worth the money.
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it again.
they can give you your assignment again.
no kidding.
i swear you don't even know how you feel there.
it's like you're walking into heavy fog, just cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next.
what do you mean?
" cameras aren't on? "
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated.
let's send scelzi down and have her look, you're ten.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
we'll talk or i'll leave or i'll talk or
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i had a little research done.
you're talking about all the local girls you slept with when you said " stuffed away "?
am i right?
big lips, broad hips, taylor.
okay, the prison wasn't just for men?
do women have a division?
and that fucking nutjob is wandering around the women's section, never answering to anyone.
he beat them, raped them, impregnated them, starved them.
some people say they feed their own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this real story's gonna keep interest in the show!
anyone could be talking about us.
this story you're making up is nothing compared to the truth.
i think so.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do this, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
really?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they are.
good.
scelzi, what is that?
just a little something to make me take the night off.
you want some?
get your hairy ass back here, okay?
aye, aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the shit out of me.
i've got a great deal.
suit yourself.
we're totally ready to begin.
i can tell you my biggest fear is being buried alive.
where am i going now?
" this will lead you to freedom. "
okay, okay, okay
i'm at the end of freedom place.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
damn!
what?
blood.
it's not real blood.
no curse, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs aren't downstairs, just go upstairs.
i'm sorry.
00 feet?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down there, you're gonna see a door with a fence on it.
he says... he says... he says... he
damn it!
" welcome to detention unit five, cell number five.
" considering the violence and the madness of violence,
shit.
tell me what i have to do and i'll get out of this hell right now.
no!
thank you.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, " if a convict and doesn't make it through suicide, he says,
" you will suffer the punishment given to a prisoner at the moment of summation
okay, where's the hole?
under your feet.
this place is literally full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult mission.
" what you're going to do when you're in a vegggone, is
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my mission.
connie.
what?
look at this.
what?
oh... it can't... it can
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back, and you added something to the show that i specifically didn't tell you, and you're asking why you were fired?
this isn't our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you have to take that guy out, okay?
it's gonna ruin the show.
damn it!
we're ruined.
so you didn't bring this in there?
no with cuts.
it's obvious.
what's open?
come closer.
i asked you why you had a camera in the control room.
yeah.
the backstage surveillance footage... what they wanted to record... what they wanted to record...
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
genius, isn't it?
it's totally genius.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to book us, put things in a show, scare us to death on the record?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black horse and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you might be reassigned.
that's a lot.
okay, black king and white horse are turning right and going to the gas chamber.
white queen and black horse are going straight, and they're going to prison cuisine.
okay, later.
good luck.
"king and horse take a right after left.
"rook and ride all the way to the end of the hallway,
"and go down the stairs? "
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, open it.
we're in.
" welcome to the gathering room.
there must be a light behind you, turn it on.
" the black one and white horse are entering the gas chamber.
nice set, connie.
he deserved the best there, it was the real place.
it's the only place the law branch cleansed.
beautiful, isn't it?
it's pretty creepy.
oh, god.
what's that smell?
it's a well documented fact... that execution rooms often carry the smell of death itself.
of course the smell isn't actually death.
if a man knows his recent moments of his life, he's on the final radar, his anxiety is caused by the stuff that smells a lot of stink.
in this case, the smell of the human smell we're breathing and the smell of the gas that killed him.
it's time for fun, ladies and gentlemen.
