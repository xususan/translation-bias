michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, his brother, buster, whom he shared his bed.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i will.
i have to write an essay of at least 000 words... about the morality of war and the possibility of a conflict.
i'm not sure our moral teacher would like me to cheat while writing a trial.
so, you passed my moral test.
as a matter of fact, he burned the sister, desperately, desperate for her teacher, bethbaerly.
even the hands of men who commit small crimes can be blown to shreds.
he doesn't have a ring no ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
it was right on us.
your father thought it would make us look better.
he must have imitated my signature.
"maybe a year ago, i'll have a son who finished sinking cheese!
you must save me from this.
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't look at him either.
i don't have a mother's compassion and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i give you olive branch here.
yes.
by the way, when did you sleep with anyone?
meanwhile, lindsay was giving george michael her homework.
why i'm telling you this.
i guess it's because there are things that people can't tell their father.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to arrange his teacher to set up his father... so he could be his mother.
there's nothing wrong with that.
however, i must explain to you that i've been a little broken since you didn't think of me for this.
the stills can do this mission.
teachers can do that.
surely, someday, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay was never so proud of what she said her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i keep telling you.
she's really... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
you have a moustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache.
yeah.
but gob misunderstood the sentimental interest in michael's kindness... and felt he was competition to interfere.
because, you know, beyond affection... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
_
and george sr was about to visit a surprise visit.
i read all your teachings and got all your tapes.
and i watched them all again.
george s.r. recently released a series of suggestions... to make money from the spiritual spirit... to make money from the soul he'd discovered.
i also lost two kilos of your banana bluth jail bar.
i came to find out where you were.
this is a nice place to start.
and michael met lindsay at the parent-teacher night after she got rid of the two girls she was dating.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this place have the same plan as our kitchen floor?
i think she's really good for you.
i'd think it would make him think of his motherhood.
besides, i can't rush into a job like this just because my son wants me to and marry someone.
this is mrs. baerly, the moral teacher.
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life... that can be destroyed without a reckless trigger.
and michael got to know his son's moral teacher.
that's the "rrrr."
you know, so annoying.
i mean, after mr. daniels had a stroke, they gave me this class.
i thought you were kidding.
no, i was just laughing because you laughed.
"rrrr!" - "rrrrr!"!
but, you know,
and i think i'm moral.
yeah.
a question for you.
could a parent-teacher invite a drink?
or...
yeah, he's dead.
i think it's because of this mr. daniels disaster...
let's go have a drink.
yeah, maybe it'll help.
george is dealing with his own fan.
i've already told you many sins.
maybe you'll tell me some of your sins.
well, there are legal shows showing my sins.
but, back to your sins.
tell me one of those things about... one of the things that happened in the university dormitory.
and what's going on with michael today's second date on his date with mrs. bayerly...
michael, that little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with him.
at least, i think it's him.
you have to rob her to freeze to say something definite.
yes, mother.
they'll take her back.
don't take your shoes off, little man!
don't take your shoes off!
out of control.
who is it?
it's "annong," your father and i adopted it.
what, i'm leaving for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille buster noticed he was worried, even jealous.
and he figured out what it feels like to be ignored.
annyong is your sister's your sister now your sister's
cancel.
he stays.
listen, i'll call you back.
good ride.
are you making reservations for dinner?
he made a "fak korean."
and after the dates...
michael took a step he hadn't thrown in years.
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we sneak in without waking everyone up?
this may not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i loved.
i took someone you love.
i'm "nashbagerlajam"
listen, i know you're trying to get revenge on the whole marta thing.
i was lying to you, so...
he has to accept it.
i don't think there's any problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i'm really lucky i got rid of him.
no problem.
very romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i must say i didn't know it was real first.
but now... your moral teacher...
yeah, i did it for her.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm pretty sure you're interested in him.
i'm sure you don't like sadam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to her to show her that i care about her.
about his class?
i mean, she loved him...
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with him.
well, why did he do that?
why did she sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new...
he's not one of the good snipers targeting his target, and he's almost everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think that he was...?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think she's old?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
she was accompanying young girls in different dances... and i was kind of a joke, so i thought i'd go and do something...
"hi, do you wanna dance?"
and she's like, i thought, "what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it differently across the mirror, but...
but, you know, it's, uh, we're dancing with a joke or something.
i didn't think so detailed.
don't you think you should go out with someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've proven a difficult book that was found in the bath suite of saddamas disappointment.
"what would my mistad?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, here's the same fire escape.
in jail, george sr was preparing for my evening with his most loyal fan.
when cindi lightballoon makes his own preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and when george michael was still angry with gob, he went looking for the family expert on making trouble.
i know you're dating shannon.
that cheerleader?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different dances.
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr daniels, and i asked him... but he was breathing, and he dropped the phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe i should go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hello.
my mother took him.
he's got me registered to do school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the situation with miss bearly and george michael.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
i want to talk to you about that.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality...
see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's, like, in love with you, so...
he knows we're out.
i told her you slept with my brother.
this could be the most immoral thing i've ever heard.
well, you're just a half-term moral teacher.
look, it was a hunch.
my brother was gonna try to sleep with you.
so, i want to leave you right now, and i'm not going back to you.
i see.
from now on.
she went for a walk with george scrandi.
george.
and she's getting to know him.
you can spill your heart out here completely.
it weights on my soul.
you...
he's picking up the camera.
i'm taking grandmother to the dance, which means your dinner's away with mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy.
watch your back, my immigration little brother!
and the different spring dances were at the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting him in because he doesn't have strong square jaws... with his perfectly flawed nose, like you.
do you want to dance?
all right!
he finally found the shannon he was looking for...
gobun found out he was cheating on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i ruined our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about it for a long time, and-ve...
that's... that's your right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, with my moral teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my moral teacher.
after you've been so bad to you, you've been really worried about protecting me.
actually, gob mistook michael's morality teacher for citizen's citizenship.
man, the type... he understood.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a teacher of citizenship.
second move.
i've been seeing mrs. baerly, and i should never have dragged gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to this.
we're open to this.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed on some sad things, but...
i don't think we'll have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm getting this cake.
hey, you wanna dance?
i can't believe this is working.
next arrested in developement.
buster's pull is sore.
stop, stop, stop!
no candles here.
mom's going crazy.
no, it's okay.
i light my candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
no problem.
right here, let me help you.
these?
okay, i'll move it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is something really extreme.
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
ok!
ok!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we all go one day, right?
four months ago, each of you joined an interview to join a never-before-seen tv show.
and guess what?
you win.
i think some people came to life on tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm a real gay guy and i'm proud of it.
you're so sweet, aren't you?
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel from england.
me too.
that's my brother stanton, my parole officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit her head.
she doesn't know.
but i do.
dixon, 0:00, 00 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they look like barack obama these days.
each of you will make $00,000, all you have to do is spend one night in this prison.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
damn!
cool.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know if this is a prank?
right.
it's our third show, but we're not gonna publish until the fall.
to find out if this is a prank, you're gonna have to play and earn the money.
you'll be asked to perform a series of duty.
the missions will force your borders, your courage and thought.
that sounds fun, right?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make up your mind now.
i'm in.
where am i signing?
i didn't have a girlfriend to admit it even when she was high.
i have to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are insane.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
come around.
you'll notice.
the money will be spent equally in the survival of the survivors, but if you all take the night out, there's a wealthy prize.
no money can spend the night here.
anyone else want to join him?
not me.
there's no way i'm gonna go to the city with this piss boy with this
i'm in.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you guys are idiots.
it's a fucking party joke, they're all gonna fuck with you.
you don't look anything but a bunch of idiots.
can't you see it's a party taken off this rock?
or we'll be famous.
there's a human head!
don't worry, it's not real.
it seemed pretty real to me.
that's why they call us special effects.
isn't that nice?
a little sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thanks to our reward special effects team.
follow me, friends.
in hot swamp water, lazy crocodiles are waiting for their prey.
the indian crocodiles are long and benevolent.
such crocodators...
guys.
i see you work as hard as ever.
ready?
we're all set.
and exactly.
keep this up.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great that you scared them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are gonna join the show.
you really looked like you were scared.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really gives me the creeps.
did you know that?
homeless ones?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
that must be a big coincidence.
you think it's really safe there?
it's safe enough for show insurance.
any more questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're rolling.
each of you has been chosen by your own free will to win $00,000 a night in prison.
isn't that clear?
all right, let's get this party started.
you can find everything you need at your base camp, that's the director's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe somebody should write it down.
but how can we write?
go down the hall, turn right, right, then left.
straight down the stairs, left, right, and another left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
there you will find a key to get rid of your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought it was awful getting out of the basement.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to the mission.
could you not do that?
i can't see shit here.
anybody remember where we're going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, twice right, then left.
there was too much going on.
no, go straight down the hall, no, no, down the hall, down the
"turn around, make it right again, and left."
"then straight down the stairs,
"sola, right, and left" again."
what are you?
smart.
illet, it's gonna be a great show.
careful.
careful.
jesus.
what is this place?
and get ready.
that was fun.
let's speed them up a bit.
okay, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
the power's running out, the generator should've taken over.
damn it!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's freezing here.
look, the key.
yeah.
okay.
look, guys.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think so, director.
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what, man?
"hi, brave contestants.
"welcome to clem harvis' office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room.
"this chess rocks will determine your personal role.
"you cannot change your rocks with other contestants.
"the rays were her favorite."
now it's your turn to put your hand in the box.
shit.
well, who wants first?
ben.
what's going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black rook.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
damn!
that was a real freak.
welcome to my little piggies, mission.
now let me tell you about the pennyville state prison.
in 0000, during the crisis, when the cost went up, the ruthless warden thought he'd increase his fortune by destroying some expenses.
these were prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the director's crimes were released.
the last person to be sentenced to death here was principal harvis himself.
rumor has it that the director is still out here in the halls.
you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured souls under this building tonight.
first mission.
your white queen.
try not to die!
anyone want to change?
no!
okay.
"the white queen must go to jail's church to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first corridor.
that sounds great.
thanks.
damn it!
what happened?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, relax, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung the babies!
kids...
i think they've got the whole thing covered with speakerons.
the voices are more efficient than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
jesus!
that sounds lovely.
no, i'm fine, man.
freak.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
there's a sound.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're calling from the speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off the flashlight.
okay?
open the marked page from the bible...
"you will find the lord's prayer there.
"a disrespect for this place that was sacred 00 years ago,
"now this is the chamber of extraordinary events."
oh... "the opposite."
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do this.
"when you complete your mission...
"if there's no sign of the director,
"you can go back to camp."
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry about who i'm bothering.
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
" protect us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"never let evil rule us.
"keep us out of the way...
"give us our debts as we forgive those who owe us.
"give us our daily bread today.
"as in heaven...
"as in the sky,
"because domination and domination are yours."
please tell me i can go now.
"before i go camping"
jesus, randall, you have to blow out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there a minute.
look what's done for the money.
where'd he go?
from what i understand, the people who did this, they cut off our connection to our homo friend for a while to give us a more frightening air into the business.
whatever.
definitely, it's gone.
guys?
i think we did something awesome.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, man, it's not that bad.
definitely not worth the money.
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it again.
they can serve you again.
no kidding.
i swear you don't even know how you feel there.
it's as if you're walking in the busy fog, it's just as cold as ice.
creepy.
is it just me, or is it cooler here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next time.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated.
let's send scelzi down and check it out, you're on.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
either talk or i'm gonna go.
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i had a little research done.
you mean the girls from the town you slept with when you said "don't fuck"?
am i right?
big lips, wide hips, taylor.
okay, prison isn't just for men?
were there any women in the department?
and that fucking crazy director wouldn't answer anybody if she was naked around the women's department.
beat them, rape them, get them pregnant, and starve to death.
some people call themselves their babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this real story will increase interest in the show!
everyone might be talking about us.
that's nothing compared to the story you made up.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do this, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
yeah?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they do.
good.
scelzi, what is that?
it's just a little something to get me out of the night.
want some?
now, get your hairy ass over here, okay?
aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the hell out of me.
i've got a great stuff.
suit yourself.
we're fully prepared to begin.
i can tell you my biggest fear is being buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will lead you to freedom."
okay,
at the end of freedom.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
damn!
what?
blood.
it's not real blood.
no swears, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs aren't below, you're upstairs.
i'm sorry.
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down, you're gonna see a door with a finger.
he says...
damn it!
welcome to cell number five.
"if we consider the violence and the madness,
shit.
tell me what to do... and i'll get out of this hell.
no!
thanks.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a prisoner can't commit suicide,
"now you'll be punished for a prisoner."
okay, where's the hole?
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult mission.
"what will you do when you're in the hole."
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my mission.
connie.
what?
check this out.
what?
no...
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back, and i specifically told you something, and you ask me why you were fired?
this is not our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you have to take that guy out, okay?
she's gonna screw up the show.
damn it!
we'll be ruined.
so you didn't bring this?
cut it out, no.
very clear.
what's open?
come closer.
i asked you why you put a camera in the control room.
yeah.
the camera footage... they want to record...
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
genius, right?
definitely brilliant.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to take us to the record how he scares us by putting things in the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you could reschedule.
that's busty.
okay, black king and white horse go right and go to the gas chamber.
white queen and black horse go straight, and go to the jail kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"beg and the left and then right.
"go and ride down the hall,
"and get down the stairs."
scelzi, answer me.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, pick up.
we're in.
"welcome to the gathering room.
there must be a light in the wall behind you, open it.
"black king and white horse go into the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
that place deserved the best, it's a real place.
it's the only place the legal department cleaned up.
beautiful, isn't it?
it's scary.
jesus.
what's that smell?
a documented true execution rooms often carry the smell of death itself.
of course, the smell is not death.
if a man knows his last moments of his life, his last worry about the radius that smells a lot of stuff that stinks.
in that case, the smell of the human smell that we breathe is the smell of gas that kills him.
now for fun, ladies and gentlemen.
the black king is sitting in the chair.
black king?
that's me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you will find some meat and a chick.
"you'll eat this beef."
man!
the prisoners are always eaten meat, pig...
"...or there is no lamb or another meat...
"and they suspected it was happening.
"they thought they'd never tasted before."
you mean human flesh, right?
are you in?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i gave up.
you're gonna tie toni up.
i'm transferring you from here, toni, before the gas is released, the fear of the prisoners must completely live.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends have strange wishes.
are you okay?
okay.
"your duty teammate...
"to find the main van and cut the gas before it kills."
you should watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to throw up.
okay.
strange.
i can't do this.
i can't.
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
"no more tricks."
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they'll pay for extra money."
do it for the team, girl.
are you gonna throw up?
thanks.
okay, angel, i'm at the bottom of the stairs.
shit!
can you hear me?
he's back.
it really stinks.
let me out.
come on.
get me out, man.
jesus!
who's the man standing there?
cheeky.
