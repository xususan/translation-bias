michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, the one he shared his bed was his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for both of us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i will.
i need to write a essay about the moral side of the war and the ability of a conflict to prevent at least 000 words.
i'm not sure our ethics teacher would like me cheating while writing a essay.
so you passed my moral test.
as a matter of fact, he was desperately burned by the teacher of bethbaerlyad.
small crimes... can barely cut off the hand of any man.
no ring ring ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
the g.d.k.'s eye was on us.
your father thought it would make us look charity.
he must have faked my signature.
maybe a year ago i'll have a son... finish his cottage cheese!
you gotta get me out of this
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't look at him either
i don't have a mother's kindness and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yes-yes.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
meanwhile, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
why do i tell you this?
i guess there's some things you can't tell your father about
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set his teacher... to fulfill his motherhood.
there's nothing wrong with that.
but i have to explain to you that i'm a little hurt because you don't think about it.
auntie can do that.
and the teachers can do that.
surely someday you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay had never been so proud of what she said her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i was telling you about.
girl, really... young girl.
your date, nazh... your date, your
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma," you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache
yeah.
but gob misunderstood the emotional attraction that michael was courtesy... and felt he was fighting to get involved.
because, you know, beyond love... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
ich nazhgalia, michael, shannon really?
and there was a surprise visit to george sr.
i read all your teachings and i got all your tapes.
and i watched them all again.
george sr. had recently put a series of tapes on the market he'd recently explained to people about his solution to make money from his new spirituality.
i also lost two kilos eating your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to find out where
this is a good place to start.
and michael met lindsay at parent-teacher night after the two girls he was dating.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this room have the same floor plan as our kitchen?
i think she's perfect for you.
i thought you'd get it out of your head.
besides, i can't rush a job like this because my son wants to, and i can't marry someone.
i'm miss baerly, the vice teacher.
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life... that could be destroyed by an insensitive trigger.
and michael started getting to know his son's vice teacher.
that's the "rrrr" side.
you know, it's very annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr daniels' stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you laughed.
"rrrr!" - "rrrrr!"
but, you know, ... ... ... ... ...
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite you for a drink?
or... or...
yes, he's dead
well, i think that mr. daniels' stroke of the stroke...
let's go have a drink.
maybe it will help.
george sr was dealing with his own admirer.
i've already told you so many sins.
maybe you can tell me a few sins.
well, there are legal indicatives to my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me about one of those things that happened... at the university dorm again.
and what's his date with miss bayerly today's second date...
michael, this little korean came, and i don't know what to do with him.
at least, i think it's him.
to tell you for certain, you have to rob him to the underwear
yes, mother.
they'll take him back.
don't take off your shoes, little gentleman!
don't take off your shoes!
it's out of
who is it?
this "annong," your father and i have adopted.
what, i'm leaving for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille noticed the buster was worried, even jealous.
and he knew what it felt like to be ignored.
annyong is your brother's your brother
abort.
he's stay
listen, i'll call you back.
nice driving.
are you making dinner reservations?
it was a little korean.
and after the meetings...
michael took a step he hadn't taken in
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
very good idea.
but how are we gonna sneak in without waking everyone up
this might not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but apparently we're even now.
you took someone i love.
so i took someone you loved.
i'm "nashbagerajam"...."
listen, i know you're trying to get back at me for the marta thing.
i was lying to you when i said i wouldn't try to sleep him, so...
he needs to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i really had a chance to get rid of him.
no problem.
so romantic.
who's "n bahn-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but first i don't know if it's real.
but now... your moral teacher...
yeah, i did that for her.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm sure you're interested in her.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
about his lesson?
i mean, she loves him... that he loves
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with him.
and why did he do that?
why did he sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new... new...
he's not one of the good shooters that targeted him, and he's about to shoot everywhere
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, you think he's old for you, don't you think he's old
we don't even know how old he is.
nobody knows.
she was accompanying young girls at different dances... and i thought i'd go up to her side of the joke, do something...
"hey, you want to dance?"
and i thought, "oh, what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it different in front of the mirror, but
but, you know, um, we've been dancing with a joke or something.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should date someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i figured out a book that was hard to find a picture in the bathroom suite of saddamy.
what did sadadam do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's the same as our fire escape.
in prison, george sr was preparing for an evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon makes his preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael, while he's still angry with gob, he's looking for a family specialist to create trouble.
i know you went out with shannon.
with that cheerleader?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid,
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and i asked him... but he was breathing and he dropped the phone.
i haven't heard back.
you know, maybe we should both go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hello.
mom took him.
do's making me record it at school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss george michael's condition with mrs. bearly.
i'm sorry.
hey.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
i want to talk to you about it.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality... about mor
you see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's like in love with you, so...
he knows we're dating.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most contemptible thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been a moral teacher half a semester
look, it was a preemptive move.
my brother was trying to sleep with you.
then i want to leave you right now and i'm not coming back to you.
i see.
starting now.
george sr. went for a walk with cindi.
george.
and he got to know her.
you can totally pour your heart out here.
it weighs upon my soul
you, you...
he's picking up the camera
so this is your dinner, so it's away with mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy
watch your back, my little immigration brother!
and the different spring dance was in the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting him in because he doesn't have a strong square jaw with your perfectly-shaped nose and round eyes.
you wanna dance?
all right!
he finally found the shannon he was looking for...
he learned that gob cheated on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
sorry.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i ruined our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about this for a while, and-and...
you mean this is the right thing to do.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, my vice teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my vice teacher.
i'm really moved by you trying to protect me after i treated you so badly.
in fact, gob mistook michael's ethics teacher with domestic studies.
man, he... he knows.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a domestic teacher.
second position.
i was seeing miss baerly, and i shouldn't have dragged gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never wanted to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed about some sad things, but...
i don't think we have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm taking this cake.
hey, you wanna dance?
i can't believe this is working.
on the next arrested development.
buster's sweat gets heated.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
no candles allowed here.
mom goes crazy.
no, it's okay.
i burn my own candle.
yeah, that's what i'm gonna do
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
no problem.
right here, let me help you.
these too?
okay, here, let me carry it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is something really extreme.
too much.
come on!
come on!
ok!
ok!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die
we'll all go someday, won't we?
four months ago, each of you joined a interviews to join a show that had never been done.
and guess what?
you win.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm totally gay, and i'm proud of
you're sweet, aren't you
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel, from england.
me too.
that's my brother stanton; my probation officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him in the head.
he doesn't know
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they look like barack obama these days.
each one of you will make $00,000, all you have to do is spend a night in this prison.
abandoned prison.
wow!
fuck!
cool.
how come i never heard this show?
how do we know if this is a prank?
right.
this is our third show, but we're not gonna run it until the fall.
to see if this is a prank or not, you're gonna have to play and earn the money.
you will be asked to perform a series of tasks.
the missions will force your borders, your courage and your thinking.
sounds like fun, doesn't it?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i didn't even have a girlfriend to admit it when he was
i need to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
around.
you'll notice.
the money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if you all make it through the night, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can give me a night here.
anyone else want to join him?
not me.
there's no way i'm going to the city with this
i'm in
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him
bye.
you guys are idiots.
it's a bloody party joke, you're all gonna get high.
you're nothing but a bunch of idiots.
don't you see this recording party?
or become famous.
there's a human head in there!
don't worry, it's not
looks pretty real to me.
that's why they call it "special effects."
lovely, isn't it
a little sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thank you for our special effects team.
follow me, my friends.
in hot swamp water, lazy crocodiles await their prey.
the indian crocodiles are tall and slim-faced
this kind of crocodile...
guys.
i see you work hard as usual.
are we ready?
we're totally
and absolutely.
keep it that way.
yes, sir.
hey.
great job scaring them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are gonna be in the show
you really looked like you were compromised.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really gives me the creeps when
did you know that?
the homeless who died?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
probably a big coincidence.
do you really think it's safe there?
safe enough to get the show insured.
any more questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're recording.
each one of you was chosen by your own free will to spend the night in jail to win $00,000 a head.
clear enough, isn't it?
all right, let's get the party started.
you can find everything you need at your base camp, that's the principal's office.
where?
it's compl
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you took everything we had, how can we write it?
go down the hall, turn right, right again, then left.
straight to the stairs, left, right, and another left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
there you will find a key to escape your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought leaving the basement was terrible.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to the mission.
can you not do that?
i can't see a damn thing in here
does anyone remember where we're going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, two right, then left.
too much straight.
no, straight down the hallway down the hall, straight
"turn around, do it right again, and left.
"then straight to the stairs stairs,
"sola, right, and left again".
what are you?
smart.
illet, this is gonna be a great show
careful.
careful.
oh, god.
what is this place?
and get ready.
it was fun.
let's give them some speed.
yes, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't
the power's running, the generator should have kicked in already.
shit!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here
it's freezing in here
look, key.
yeah.
okay.
look, guys.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think it's the ward
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what's up, man?
"hi brave contestants.
"welcome to warden clem harvis' office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room
these chess rocks will determine your personal role.
"you cannot exchange your balls with other contestants.
"the rags were his favorite".
"now it's your turn to put your hand in the box."
shit.
well, who wants to go first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't
what do you mean you don't know
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black rook.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
fuck!
that was really crazy.
my little piggies, welcome to the mission.
now let me tell you about the pennyville state prison.
in 0000, when the crisis was increased, the brutal warden decided to destroy certain expenses and raise his fortune.
they were prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the warden was exposed.
the last person to be sentenced to death here was warden harvis himself.
rumor has it the warden's still roaming the halls.
you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured souls at this building tonight.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
anybody want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the prison chapel to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first hallway.
the sound is awesome.
thank you.
shit!
what happened?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, relax, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung babies!
their children... their
i think it's all covered with speakerphone.
voices are more effective than images to trigger our fears.
is that right?
okay.
oh, god!
sounds lovely.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't
something came up.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're making noise from the speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flashlight.
okay now?
open the bible's marked page...
"where you will find god's prayer.
"00 years ago, the sacred place was disrespected 00 years ago,,
"now this is the chamber of unusual events."
oh, that's the opposite.
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit
i can't do
"when you complete your mission...
"if a sign doesn't come from the principal,
you can go back to camp".
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry, whoever i'm bothering
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
" save us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"don't let evil rule us.
"protection us from overstepping...
"give us our debts, as we forgive those who owe us.
"and give us our daily bread today.
"as heavenly in heaven...
"like in the sky,
"because dominance and dominance are yours."
please tell me i can go now.
"before we hit camp"...
jesus, randall, you should blow out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look what they do for money.
where'd he go?
from what i understand, the people who did this job have cut off our contact with our homo friend for a little while to give it a more creepy weather.
whatever.
definitely, it's gone pretty smooth
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, man, it's not that bad.
definitely not worth the money.
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it
they can give you another assignment.
don't joke
i swear you don't even know how you feel in there.
it's like walking through thick fog, just cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next.
what do you mean?
some cameras aren't working?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complex.
let's get sczi to go down and have a look, you'll have it.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go downstairs and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy
either we talk or i go.
it's important to me too, taylor
what do you mean?
i did a little research.
are you talking about the town girls you've been sleeping with?
am i right?
big lips, broad hips, taylor.
okay, so the prison wasn't just for
is there a women's department?
and that fucking crazy warden walked around the women's section naked, never answered anyone.
he would beat them, rape them, get pregnant, and starve them to death.
some people say they feed their own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this real story will improve the show!
anyone could be talking about us.
that's nothing compared to the fact that you invented the story.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do that, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
yeah?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they do.
good.
sczi, what is that?
just a little something to help me take off the night.
want some?
get your hairy ass over here, okay?
aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the hell out of me.
i got a great stuff.
suit yourself.
we're all ready to begin.
i can tell you my biggest fear is to be buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will take you to freedom of freedom."
okay,
at the end of liberty.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
fuck!
what?
blood.
it's not real
no cursing, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs aren't down, you're up.
i'm sorry
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you go down, you'll see a door with a finger
he says... he says
shit!
"welcome to cell number five.
" considering the violent and insanity and insanity,
shit.
tell me what to do... so i can get out of this hell.
no!
thank you.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a convict can commit suicide if he can't,
"now you shall live punishment for a prisoner."
okay, where's the
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult task.
"what will you do when you enter the half".
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my duty.
connie.
what?
check this out.
what?
can't...
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back, and i specifically told you... you added a show, and you're asking me why you were fired?
this isn't our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't
don't look at me.
look, connie, you have to get that guy out, okay?
he's gonna screw
shit!
we'll be ruined.
you didn't bring this there?
cut it out, no.
very clear.
what's clear?
approach.
i asked you why you were putting cameras in the control room.
yeah.
behind the surveillance footage... they want to record... the
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
it's brilliant, is
absolutely brilliant.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to record how scared you put something on the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black king and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you could be reassigned.
smartass.
okay, black king and white horse turning right and heading to the gas chamber.
the white queen and black horse are running straight, and they're going to the prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"king and horse go left and then right.
"rook and the horse go all the way down the hallway,
"and go down the stairs".
sczi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
sczi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, open it.
we're in.
"welcome to the pack room.
there must be a light on the wall behind you, open it.
"black king and white knight entering the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
it deserves the best, it's the whole place.
it's the only place the legal department cle
isn't it beautiful?
pretty scary.
oh, god.
what's that smell?
documented facts of death often carry their own smell of death.
of course the smell isn't your death
if a man knows his life is coming to the end of his life, his concern is caused by the release of matter which gives him plenty of smells.
in that case, what we're worried about is the smell of human smell and the gas that killed him.
it's fun time, ladies and gent
the black hawk is sitting in the chair.
black king?
this is me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you will find some meat and a panic.
you'll cook this meat and eat it.
man!
prisoners always eat meat's flesh cows, pig...
"or because there's no lamb or some other meat...
"that he was suspected.
they thought it was a nice meat they'd never tasted before.
you mean human flesh, don't you?
are you in there?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i gave up.
you'll get toni on the phone.
i'm giving it to you, toni should totally live the fear of the prisoners just before the gas is given.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends have some weird demands.
are you okay?
okay.
"your mission's gas teammate...
to find the main van without killing and cut the gas."
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to puke.
okay.
weird.
i can't do
i can't
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
"no more pranks."
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they'll pay extra money".
do it for the team, girl.
are you gonna throw up?
thank you.
okay, angel, i'm at the bottom of the stairs.
shit!
can you hear me?
he's back
it really stinks.
let me out.
come on.
let me out, man.
oh, god!
who's the guy standing there?
topless.
muscular.
let me out.
i don't know, con. this guy is starting to creep
stop playing games.
let me out.
how's it going
we need to talk to you.
outside?
