michael had been sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, the man he shared his bed was his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's okay for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i will.
i have to write at least 000 words about the morality of a war and the morbidity of a warp and progression.
i'm not sure you'd appreciate me cheating while we're writing our morally teacher's trial.
so, you passed through my morals test.
actually, it was hopelessly burned, hopelessly, hopelessly, hopeless, hopelessly, to the teacher of bethaueradly.
criminals can be cut off even the hands of a man who committed crimes.
no ring no no ring no ring no ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you were son?
*.d.k.'s eye was on us.
your dad thought it would make us look better.
she must have imitated my signature.
'one year ago, i'd be the son of a bitch who finished her scumbag cheese.
you've got to get me out of this.
i call social services, but you need to get buster back.
but i can't look at her.
i don't have a mother's compassion and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disruption.
i'm giving you an olive dive.
yes.
by the way, when did you sleep with anyone?
by the way, lindsay was on her homework to george michael.
i can tell you why.
i guess because there are things that people can't tell their father.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set up his teacher... to get him his mother's job instead of his mother.
there's nothing wrong with that.
however, i must say i'm a little disappointed that you didn't think about me for that.
that's what the halos can do.
the teachers can replace this mission.
sure, one day, you'll find the right woman to replace this mission.
but until i make it, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay had never been so proud of what she said in her whole life.
by the way, gob was waiting for michael to arrive.
shannon, the girl i keep telling you.
she's really... young girl.
date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
"agarma," you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache.
yeah.
but gob michael's courtesy has been misunderstanding the emotional interest he's made for michael's courtesy, and he's feelin' the competition to get involved.
because, you know, beyond love... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
ughsia, michael, shannon, really?
and a surprise visit to george srr. was about to arrive.
i've read all your teachings and got all your tapes.
and i watched it all over again.
george sr. has been offered to sell a series of tapes of people he's offered to make money from the spirituality he'd just discovered.
in the meantime, i've lost two pounds, eating your banana bl ruth jail bar.
i came to find out.
this is a good place to start.
and michael met with lindsay at her parents' school night after they got rid of two girls she was dating two girls.
hey, linds, is this my dream product... or is this one with this blissing room with our kitchen gun?
i think she's perfect for you.
i used to think that would make your mother realize.
besides, i can't marry someone just because my son wants me to have a son, so i can't marry someone.
i'm mrs. baerly, morals.
my goal is to make sure my students understand the value of life that can be destroyed by an insignant pull of a trigger to a person's insignia.
and michael began to know his son's morally teacher.
that's the "rrrrr" side of the situation.
you know, it's so annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a paralyzed paralyzed.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you laughed.
"rrrrr!" - "rrrrrrrrr!"
but, you know, ...
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
one question for you.
a parents teacher can invite you for a drink?
or...
yeah, he's dead.
i think it's because mr. daniels had a paraly...
let's go have a drink.
well, maybe it'll help.
georger was dealing with his own fan.
i already told you my sins.
maybe you could tell me a couple of sins.
well, there's a hukichi show showing my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me one of those things about... one of them in college bed again.
and michael's meeting with her second date with mrs. mr. mr.erly today...
michael, this little korea is here, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it is.
you're gonna have to peel it down to your pants to say something.
yes, mom.
they'll get it back.
don't take your shoes off, little gentleman!
keep your shoes off!
it's out of control.
who is it?
it's "annong, " your dad" and i got married.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille buster realized that she was worried, even jealousy.
and he realized what it felt like to ignore it.
yongyongyongyongyongy your sister's
cancel it.
it stays.
listen, i'll call you back.
that was nice.
are you booking dinner?
he made a "fat korea."
and after meeting....
michael took a step that he hasn't been throwing for years.
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we leak everyone in without waking everyone up?
this may not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i love.
i took someone you love.
"nashbaggerlajamamam '..."
listen, i know you're trying to avenge me for the marta thing.
i was lying to you when i told you i wasn't gonna try to get her to bed, so...
he has to accept that.
i don't think there'll be any problem with that.
right.
i just slept with someone.
i say again, i didn't like nazhalia.
i really had a chance that i got rid of him.
no problem.
very romantic.
who's "n. h-ah-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i must say i didn't know it was real.
but now, now... your moral teacher...
yeah, i did it for her.
oh.
he likes sadamossein.
but, you know, in business, i'm sure you're interested in him.
i'm sure you don't like sadam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
about his class?
i mean, when she loved her loyalty...
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew you had a moral responsibility to tell your son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob has slept with him.
well, why did he do that?
why did he sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know this, but gob new...
it's not one of the good shooters who's targeting your target, and it's almost everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think... that she was... anything?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
in the different dance, young girls escorting the young girls... and i thought i'd go up to him and do something...
"amel, you want to dance?"
and she's just, like, i thought she'd be, like, "what's it gonna be?" okay?
i've done the same, but...
but, you know, it's, uh, messing up with joke, or we're doing something else.
i didn't think so.
don't you think you should go out with someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i had a book that was difficult to find a picture of the bathroom in a bathroom bathroom suite.
"what would my brother do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, here's the same exit from our fire escape.
in prison, george sr. was preparing for my evening with the most loyal fan he'd spend with.
it's about the time gandhi lightballoon made their own preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and while george michael was still angry with gob... he went to find a family specialist looking for you to create a problem with it.
i know you're dating shannon.
that ponpon girl?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid, different dancers.
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr daniels and i asked him... but he was breathing and he dropped his phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe i should go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hi.
my mother took it.
he's telling me he's recording her.
my new little sister.
so we're relatives.
and michael went to discuss george michael's situation with mrs. bearly.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morals...
you see, george michael made you this post.
you know, she's like, she's in love with you, so...
he knows we're out.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this may be the most foolish thing i've ever heard in my whole life.
well, you've only been a half-time moron teacher.
look, this is a prejudice move.
my sister was gonna try to sleep with you.
so, i want to break up with you right now, and i'm not going back to you.
i see.
from now on.
georger. went on a walk with s.r. gandhi.
george.
and he began to recognize her.
you can pour me completely at home here.
it weightes my soul.
you...
he's fighting the camera.
i'm taking your dinner, this is your dinner, so it's with my mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy.
watch your back with your back, my little brother!
and the different spring dance was in the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you don't take her perfectly perfectly perfectly-looking nose because she doesn't have a strong square jaw that doesn't have eyes.
want to dance?
all right!
finally gob finally found shannon...
gobun found out he was cheating on her with the nazhibbia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hi, lisa.
shannon!
sorry.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!!!!!!!!
i messed up our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about this for a long time, and-and...
that's... that's your right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school dance fun?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, with my moral teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my moral teacher.
after being so bad to you, it really made me feel like you're trying to protect me.
in fact, he mistook the morality teacher that gob michael's teacher was dating with the teacher at the homeland information.
man, he... he knew.
gob was a teacher for mrs whitehead country info.
second move.
i was seeing mrs. baerly, and i should never have involved gob.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with the kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed on some sad things, but...
i don't think we'll have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm taking that cake.
hey, you want to dance?
i can't believe this worked.
next one's in development.
buster's pulling is off.
stop, stop, stop, stop!
it's forbidden to have candles here.
mom's going crazy.
no, it's okay.
i burn my own candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
no problem.
right here, let me help you.
these?
okay, let me carry it for you.
yeah.

what you suggest, connie, it's really something.
too much.
come!

ok!
ok!
come!
come!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we're all going one day, aren't we?
four months ago, each of you joined an interview, to join a tv show that has never been done before.
and guess what?
you won.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
you're my biggest color yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm a total gay man and i'm proud of it.
you're sweet, aren't you?
i want to rule our country.
next question.

she doesn't know.
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 00 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they look like barack obama these days.
each one of you're gonna make $00,000.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
damn!
great.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know if this is a donkey joke?
right.
this is our third show, but we're not gonna run it through the fall.
you're gonna have to play the game and win the money to see if it's a donkey joke or not.
you will be asked to replace a series of duty.
the mission will force your limits, your courage and your thought.
sounds fun, doesn't it?
what kind of duty are these, man?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i didn't even have a girlfriend to admit it when she was a dickhead.
i have to take care of my little sister.
i'm in.
you're crazy.
do you know the past of this prison?
some people died there.
like what?
go around.
you'll notice.
the money will be equal to the survival of the survivors, but if you all take the night off, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can spend the night here.
anyone else want to join him?
not me.
i can't possibly go to the city with this little kid with this little sidikic kid like
i do.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you idiot.
it's a fucking party joke, they're all gonna be fucking with you.
you don't look anything but a bunch of idiots.
can't you see it's a party that was taken in this rock.
or we'll be famous.
there's a human head!
don't worry, it's not real.
it looked pretty real to me.
that's why they call ourselves special effects.
isn't that nice?
a small sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thank you for our bounty special effects team.
follow me, friends.
in the hot swamp water, lazy crocodiles are waiting for their prey.
the crocodiles are long and selfish.
this kind of crocod...
guys.
i see you work hard as always.
are we ready?
we're all set.
and absolutely.
keep it up.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great to scare them.
yeah.
i can't believe these guys are gonna show up.
you looked really scared.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place looks really creepy.
did you know that?
homeless?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
a big coincidence.
do you really think it's safe there?
the show's safe enough for insurance.
any other questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're moving.
each of you have been chosen by your own free will, to make $00,000 a night in jail.
isn't that clear enough?
okay, let's party.
you can find everything you need in your main camp, that's the manager's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe one of you better write.
but how can we write all the others?
go down the hallway, turn right, back to the right, then left.
straight up to the stairs, left, right, and one more left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
you'll find a key to get rid of your chains there.
is there someone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought getting out of the basement was horrible.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to duty.
can you not do that?
i can't see aunt in here.
anybody remember where we're going?
go, right, then left.
no straight, two times right, then left.
there was too much going.
go straight down the hallway,
"do it back, make it right, and left.
"go straight to the stairs,
"sola, right, and left again."
what are you?
smart.
it's gonna be a great show.
careful.
careful.
god.
what is this place?
and be ready.
that was fun.
let's speed them up a little.
okay, my queen.
come!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
the generator had to enter the patrol.
damn!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's freezing in here.
look, the key.
yeah.
okay.
look, people.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think he's the manager.
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what, man?
"the brave competition.
"welcome to clem harvis's office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room.
"your personal role in your personal role will be set.
"you can't change yourstone with other contestants.
"jil it was his favorite".
now it's your turn to put your hand in the box.
shit.
well, who wants first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean i don't know?
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black.
black castle.
white horse.
white.
look.
damn!
that was really awkward.
my little pigs, welcome to duty.
now let me tell you about pennyville state prison.
in the time of the attack in 0000, when the cost of cost, the brutal manager thought he'd raise his fortune by destroying some of the harassing.
these were prisoners!
the principal's crimes weren't executed for 00 prisoners until they were blamed.
the last person who was punished here for the last time was director harvis himself.
rumor says the director's still roaming the halls here.
you will be asked to face the spirits that have seen you tonight with the director and this building under torture.
first duty.
your white queen.
try not to die!
anyone want to change?
absolutely no!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the church of the prison to complete the mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first corridor.
sounds great.
thank you.
damn!
what happened?
they shut down my flashlight.
i can't see anything.
okay, relax, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung the babies!
their children...
i think they've got it all covered with vods.
the sounds are more powerful than the image to trigger our fears.
is that right?
okay.
god!
sounds great.
no, i'm fine, man.
nut.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
there's a sound.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're calling from the vodor, randall.
really.
okay.
oh...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flashlight.
okay now?
open the page from the bible...
"you will find god's blessing there.
00 years ago, this place was disrespectful,
"but this place is the room of unusual events."
uh... "safi".
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do that.
"when you complete your look...
"if there's no sign of the manager,
"you can go back to camp."
a deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry if i disturb you now.
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
" protect us from evil...
"our father in the cra...
"don't let evil rule us.
" protect us from...
"for forgive us our debt, as we forgive those in debt.
"give us the day our bread.
" as in heaven...
" just as it's in the take,
'cause rule and rule is yours.
please tell me i can go now.
" before we go to the camping road"...
god, randall, you have to put out my candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there a minute.
look what they've done for money.
where he went.
from what i understand, the people who do this work for this job are just a shortcut to our homo friends to give us some creepy weather.
whatever.
absolutely, it went away.
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
dude, it's not that bad.
absolutely not worth the money.
but the mission was worth money.
thank god i finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it again.
they can assignment you again.
don't joke.
i swear, you don't even know how people feel there.
it's like you walk in a busy fog, just cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me or is it getting cold in here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to get to the next one.
what do you mean?
"but the cameras don't work"?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these device is very complicated.
let's send scelati down and shake it, you know.
scotland.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
either we talk or i'll go or i'll go or i
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i had a little research done.
are you talking about the town girls you're sleeping with?
am i right?
big lips, big hips, taylor.
okay, prison wasn't just for men?
do women have a chapter?
and that fucking freak director doesn't answer anybody around the woman's department.
they beat them, raped them, they get pregnant, and they starve.
some say they feed their own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this true story is going to raise the show!
anyone might be talking to us.
that's nothing compared to the story you made up.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do this, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
yeah?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they do.
good.
scotland, what's that?
it's just a little thing to make me night out.
want some?
get your hairy ass here, okay?
captain.
hello?
you scared me.
i've got something great.
suit yourself.
we're all ready to begin.
i'd say my biggest fear is buried alive.
where am i going now?
"here will make you free."
ok
at the end of the freedom.
what am i doing now?
tell her to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
damn!
what? what?????
blood.
it's not real.
no swear, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs aren't down, so go upstairs.
i'm sorry.
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you land down, you'll see a fingerprint door.
she says...
damn!
welcome to cell five.
"if we think about violence and madness,
shit.
tell me what i have to do... and i'll get the hell out of here.
no!
thank you.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a prisoner can't kill himself,
"you're going to live a sentence to a prisoner."
okay, where's the pit?
under your feet.
this place is so full of shit.
remember the money.
that's a very difficult mission.
"what are you gonna do when you break in."
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my duty.
connie.
what? what?????
look at this.
what? what?????
no...
you're fired.
why?
you turn me behind my back, and especially after i've made my statement to you, did you add anything, and you still ask why you're fired?
this is not our man.
where'd he go?
who the hell is that?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you got to get that guy out, okay?
he's gonna put it in the show.
damn!
we're ruined.
you didn't bring this there?
no cut.
clear.
what's open?
come closer.
i asked you why you put a camera in the control room.
yeah.
the camera behind the video... what they want to record...
wow!
wow!
you're right.
genius, right?
absolutely genius.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to know how he scares us by putting something in a show?
bingo!!!!!o!
so what do we do now?
we're going to go on.
as planned.
three.
black and white horse.
mission four.
black and white queen.
i told you you could go back on duty.
it's pretty.
okay, black and white white horse turn right and go to the gas room.
the white queen and black horse keep going straight, and they go to prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"to the right after the hawk and the horse.
"let's go all the way to the end of the hallway,
"and down the stairs."
scotland, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scotti, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, open it.
we're in.
welcome to the laptop room.
there must be a light in the wall behind you, open it.
they enter the black black black and white horse gas room.
well done, connie.
it deserves the best, it's completely real.
it's the only place he's cleaning the law department.
isn't it beautiful?
pretty scary.
god.
what is that smell?
a disturbed real death death rooms often carry their own smell of death.
of course, the smell isn't your death.
if a man knows his life has come to his last moments, he's worried about the last radide, and he's got a lot of stinking stinking stinking stinking material.
in this case, the smell of human smell and the smell of gas that kills it.
now fun time, ladies and gentlemen.
he sits in the black chair.
black?
this is me.
stand by for further instructions.
"you'll find some meat and a attitude.
" cook this meat and eat."
man!
the prisoners always eat meat cow, pig...
"or that he wasn't his cousin, and another meat...
"they suspected you.
"they thought it was a pleasant meat they never had before."
you mean human meat, right?
are you inside?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i give up.
you're gonna tie toni.
i'm getting you out of here, toni has to be completely terrified of the prisoners before the gas was given.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriend's wishes are weird.
are you okay?
okay.
"your mission's gas teammate...
"to find the main van and stop the gasoline."
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to throw up.
okay.
weird.
i can't do that.

it's getting a little weird.

i don't know.
i didn't see him.
it went this way.
it doesn't come out here.
what was that?
yeah, what was that?
shit.
taylor???????

connie, are you there?
yeah.
how could you organize this?
we had a hard time.
it's gonna be a great show.
i'll see you later.

you're an asshole.

we're gonna have to be a little more creative about our fundraiser.
where the hell is oliver?
where's the plane guard?
you can break the rules, but you need a special order.
something must be done.
my general manager.
i know you don't appreciate hearing this from a policy, but it's coming.
do you know that elevator only for emergency events?
guard 0, what's your situation?
are you restless, juney?
if you just keep being my london darling, you'll get less.

your operation, harry.
say again, command center?
put your weapons down and release qasim.
what the fuck are you doing, harry?
open the doors!
open the doors!
go, go, go!
command, the prisoner has escaped!
north!
no, no!
keaton!!!!!!
the command center is chasing as agents 0 to 0a.
is there another image?
follow her.
the nearest armed unit is five minutes away.
helicopter's 00 miles away.
barrier?
in position.
the other side of the tunnel is the last one.
they have nowhere to go.
sco00 is five minutes away.
go.
agent 0, report.
ed, wait.
agent 0, report.
i repeat, the cia lia's contact has been shot.
agent 0, do you see qasim?
command, i heard a car sound.
they closed everything.
it's over.
one of the most serious mistakes in the history of the u.s. terrorist leader aid qasim's organization can confirm that one of the most serious mistakes in the history of the u.s.s
looks like the security guard transporting qasim's transplant was attacked at the ravo northolier.
you call it a murder, not a war because it's on the west streets.
because in new york, in washington, you didn't want it in london.
but neither did pakistan's kids.
when they were shot with drone air planes, they call it murder.
qasim is offering a new kind of threat.
so far, the civilians haven't targeted them.
our statues show that there's a possibility of an attack within 00 hours.
the more pressure, the less the window.
i can't say that when i'm under tape recording...
the foreign minister is coming tomorrow.
we serve the british people, not washington.
if that's not true anymore, we're already done.
americans think we don't serve purpose anymore.
we need a head.
i'll be off duty in the morning.
didn't you hear anything about qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, what happens to me if you take it off?
you can.
no one else knows qasim's in his network.
just get out.
will holloway?
go.
how's life after mi0?
you're not from moscow.
london needs you.
is there anyone you should say goodbye?
thank you.
we know about harry's connection to your family, so we understand that this may not be easy for you.
even if he's dead, it's okay.
harry's too arrogant to kill himself.
he was pretending to kill himself.
she went to this woman's grave.
love of your life.
harry's crew has noticed a change in harry's attitude since she died.
emotionally, it's cold, and it's getting high and high.
it would have been under the 0 degrees.
he used to have hypothermia before he got to the bank.
this is the picture you told the snow before you entered this land, which you were taken after the jump.
before she disappeared, harry made three code calls.
your old emergency message box.
why did he call you?
i have no idea.
the last time i talked to her, i talked to her when she took me from mi0.
she wants to talk right now.
that makes you useful.
can you help us find him?
no, thank you.
and you, harry, do you talk a lot about berlin?
the night your father died?
if anything else, mace, i have a right to know.
i don't think i can decide...
if you're not really gonna kill her, i think you just told me what you wanted to tell her.
find harry, so you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
i thought i was gonna take this title to the grave.
lately, his majesty's manager for the security service of his majesty.
funny, but who are you really?
those two words are someone who cares about you.
asma shishani.
go.
how did you find me?
what do you want?
i know someone did it on my side.
they never told me who they were.
of course they didn't, but you must have a connection.
it's a phone number, that's all.
phone number works, too.
in return, i'll give you what you want.
no way.
he said he's a human rights lawyer.
your government helped them after they put my two sisters in jail.
but after i was released, she became too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if he's an agency, he's not one of us.
and don't worry, tell me it's not worth anything to you again.
keep her alive, keep my word for it, this woman's guarantee.
i don't need a guarantee.
take him to a hospital or he'll get the deal!
what she needs is mercy.
no!
she has a daughter.
and you sent her after me?
you put her in danger and now you refuse to save her from pain?
how are you man?
don't send a video family.
harry...
you have an agreement.
it says there's no progress on how many trafficking terrorist anem qasim.
the national threat level is critical, so there's an attack on eli tower.
in the news, ftse fell 000 this morning again this morning, and your steroids, euros, and other units kept on breathing.
there's a new intelligence on harry.
he's got a detective mistake that we tracked him down to kent cast.
holloway, this is confidential information.
we also found the explosives there.
you've known him longer than all of us.
do you think it's possible that qasim put harry into business somehow?
pull her up?
i don't know.
anyway, you find harry, we find qasim.
anything for holloway?
here.
tomorrow, '00.
salpa 0, show a, park 0 to 0.
then, open your eyes.
i hope you come alone.
just for protection.
if you can't get a mad war moru without hitting a mad war moron, we're in serious trouble.
i don't promise.
not yet.
we're playing through harry's game until we see him.
copy that.
doors opening.
go.
floor.
doors opening.
an open vision, more than one way out.
repeat, holloway.
things harry needed to set up a meeting.
yes, mr. holloway, your uncle told me you'd meet you at the coffee shop.
he left his cell phone at home.
the guy in the parking lot, get rid of him.
she'd be wearing a mi0 shirt.
listen to me.
stop humiliating harry.
don't think you'll put your men in danger.
wait for the signal...
what is it, alpha one? 0?
holloway?
holloway, where are you going?
wait.
no, we don't have it there.
don't move.
howay, freeze!
original 0b.
doors closing.
he set me up.
pa000, glasgow plane.
i'm going to gasgow.
call the glasow office.
get me the airport police.
priority code number nine.
the police want an open road to the station.
and set us up for the heathrow security.
pa000, the comrades of the glasglow plane...
holloway, don't go in the air.
what am i doing here, harry?
i had to find someone i could trust outside the service.
that's a short list when drunk, crazy and dead.
to be clear, the only person i can say that i've ruined your life is the only person who thinks i've ruined it.
qasim's escape was set up by somebody at the top of the service.
by one of the people who wanted you to follow me.
that's why i had to get lost.
qasim was holding.
he's our only connection to the traitor.
when the system comes in, it's thirsty.
he's planning an attack.
someone's trying to destroy themselves.
you're crazy.
ruth's death...
don't!
look, that's all i want.
what are you waiting for, harry?
mi0 was my everything and you took it away from me, for nothing.
hate me the way you want me, but i think you do.
what happened in berlin?
did they fool you like that?
this might not be the end you care about.
i'm afraid i'm gonna have to give them something beyond your jacket.
nothing there, but they'll have to check it out.
i'll send you a number.
call me in 00 hours, please.
i'm the security services.
put your hands behind your back!
you just let her go.
calm down, charles.
we don't want you to have a heart attack.
the fatal one.
mi0 looks completely responsible right now, and i'm the last friend of the mi0.
so right now you really have to be nice to me.
in other words, he's crazy?
this doesn't contradict his last three psychiatric considerations.
he refused to join.
harry peace didn't give up.
no matter how crazy, i'll still catch him...
for example.
he asked me to help him get lost.
you didn't think it was right to accept your request and bring it to us?
don't think we're going to have to shit your life in a shitty situation just 'cause your life hasn't shit since harry threw you away from work.
since we threatened each other, you three shouldn't be covered in blood, not hanging on to the blood you're not hanging on.
your entire organization seems to be able to get out of hand right now.
find qasim.
it's full.
they're ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i saw that name working on a case.
i thought they had you on duty.
they took it.
now, what really happened?
abduction may have been set up by someone in the service.
you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i quit three weeks ago.
there must be one around here.
tell me, why did you application?
i didn't.
when i was 00 years old, i was hanging out with a guy who makes money transfers.
the ward was interested in some people using this, so they got to me.
you started as an agent?
and when i'm done, they asked me to train as an officer.
my parents came back to me when i told them.
and if somebody tried to help qasim escape, that would be a problem, right?
all right.
something felt wrong that day.
roass, my team leader, was in front of me.
he told me not to open the gun conspiracy.
he ordered me to chase.
where does he live?
loaded.
w00 account.
panama city.
bribe fund.
june, what are you...
who are you?
you told me not to fire qasim.
you told me not to fire when i treated my gun.
we swore, rob.
i'm not saying anything until i get to thames house.
we're not going to thames house.
will, what have you found?
qasim's guards were weak from the safe.
the team leader was in it.
just a footman.
find out who gave the order.
the americans think mi0 is weak and i think one of them is slaughtered inside.
when qasim escaped, we fell out of sight.
the cia took it completely.
fire...
it would.
pul...
dead.
dead.
listen.
you should go home.
june!
i'm gonna handle this, but you need to go, now.
i didn't hear a piece of this song was killed by a song like this.
who's warrender's dirty shot?
landon miller.
agency witness.
she's trying to get her support, and she's hoping not to give me the keys to the kingdom's key.
i've seen you every time i see you, you look like i've been buried in a secret place or two more like i've been buried in the langley or somebody's eyes.
you don't have to tell me.
i don't think in times like these, we shouldn't forget who's shaking the flag.
charles.
i'm trying to help, but he's officially accusing me of doing a job for the cia.
tonight, your generals, your politics, your spies came together for a blessing.
tonight, we attack the heart of their powers.
our enemy, your sons and girls, who send your girls to die in illegal war.
spies who spy on you like you are criminals.
this war is far beyond the religious change.
every flight from the united kingdom...
you had it.
warren was alive.
if you have a way to get to qasim, say it now.
there's another way.
qasim's wife.
asma shishani.
she's got fsb's.
if i find where they hold her, she'll give the traitor.
you made a deal with him.
yeah.
and if we can make it right, he'll take us to him.
surrender and set.
how do you know the russians have it?
in exchange for a cia agent who's trapped in moscow.
i can get away from me, but you need to open the secret door.
this is a ip address.
you're kidding.
it's the only way, will.
harry's getting help from somewhere.
i searched their old contacts, but i have to access the staff files to do it properly.
but it won't take you anywhere exciting.
i'm in position.
looks like i'm gonna have to steal more extra bandwidth.
drink up.
malcolm???????
okay, i'm in.
i'm looking at the servers now.
harry, we have to go.
can't we do that faster?
i can do it.
but unfortunately, this machine was a century ago.
that's what the g.t. did.
erin watts.
it might be worth looking at.
fill it up for me.
but there's been a spy.
i almost took it out.
i've been a professional for less than a year.
or they're making you choose sooner or later.
all right, i'll leave you alone.
is it?
am i sure?
i'm sorry, will.
harry.
harry!
harry, what did you do?
stay away from the computer.
i didn't mean to say this before, but i hope you know what you're doing.
harry is working with qasim?
he stole a whole gchq data.
everything we have on our friends in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
he was seen in schnapield airport cc.
i don't know.
harry didn't attack that cyber attack alone.
then who's helping her?
except you.
and you're still protecting him.
why?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i'll find him.
and there's a threat.
analysis says there's gonna be a big-time attack within 00 hours, more than one target.
an agent lost in qasim's escape mission.
he's got a struggle at home.
you know anything about that?
how's your mother, holloway?
i heard it wasn't very good.
your father hasn't packed since he died.
understand, really.
and then that door works.
i know, i know.
harry was right about one thing.
you're not good enough.
can we really hope the home secretary would stop qasim's attack again?
we destroyed the threat to our freedom and our way of life.
it may be important that you don't hurt us, but it's the end.
you'll find out that our decision isn't the line.
they're not listening.
they never killed our women?
we make the world a better place, brother.
the transplant team is at the airport.
we have a warrant to shut down the road to the prison car when necessary.
i think i owe you.
you were absolutely right about vass.
dank.
thank you.
metron's on the u.s. corner, 00th.
we have safe house.
let's call it nostalgia.
don't forget to bring the i.d.
don't forget to bring his wife.
how did you find me?
there's only one place to meet in berlin.
you told me.
it's the u.s. corner of afghanistan.
no emotion.
this is the price of qasim's wife.
once she's out of custody, qasim will give me a number.
he'll take me to the traitor.
they're going to be able to lift the service to where it's vulnerable to take over this.
get in the car, harry.
there's an old hotel 00 minutes away.
my contact can meet us there with a four clean passport.
you're going home.
i'm sorry about that.
why are you here, mrs. keaton?
keep moving, harry.
i killed someone because of you.
you're c0.
what are you doing, harry?
talent.
so which one did you find?
jesus, will.
everything is ready.
vass?
when i came home, i reported it.
i said someone was asking about qasim's escape.
they tied me to the command center and they told me what to do.
they went to vass's house before us and planted evidence.
i set up vass's escape.
you think i want to do it?
i know my mission.
i'm the only one here who knows.
you're in the game.
he's right, will.
but i wonder if mrs. keaton is right about me.
it was a safe chain.
what was i supposed to do?
do you believe him?
yeah.
i'm sure your men will come and find you, if it's still useful.
what did you think they'd do to you after all this is over?
i did what they asked me to do.
we're changing the deal.
we're taking qasim's wife to london.
tell him to get yourself back or he'll never see his wife again.
let's go get her.
what's happened to afghanistanz?
it's an an an anomaly.
i'm afraid there was something wrong with qasim's wife.
at least let's get to work by my car.
harry.
colonel.
i don't appreciate being rude, but we're gonna need your clothes.
while aem qasim's calling for qasim, everyone in the united kingdom's national line has to check in and check out the governor's identity and governor.
i got your wife.
let me talk to him.
the russians put him and...
bullshit.
i'm bringing her to london.
no.
i'll tell your whore you said goodbye.
was the baby too much?
no, you're the same.
i trusted june.
you were right to take me off duty.
despite everything i've done, you're still doing something good here.
i won't let the sacrifices get away.
it was here.
was it fast?
he could have let me go, but he chose not to.
if you try anything, anything, i can't guarantee anyone's safety.
no one.
you bring my wife, i'll give you your phone number.
here we go.
hello?
holloway.
this message came from the he.
me.
we can catch qasim, but i need help.
and let's go.
one clean choice, hannah.
trust me, and help me.
or go.
good or good, right?
shit.
they're closing in on me.
last night i wrote myself last night, the u.s. i've written, it's a reminder of all potential looks.
so he doesn't cut the shit?
please.
okay, here we are.
how much time do we have?
i'm looking at 000 cameras.
give me something.
as soon as he realizes we're playing him, he's gone.
wait.
worked 00 seconds ago.
are you sure?
yeah, it's confirmed.
camera's out of line in the last minute.
third floor roof, east corner.
harry, we have to vote.
i really hope you're looking at us.
yeah? yeah? yeah?
try the south.
i have his wife.
you were supposed to look south.
give me the number.
give me the number or we'll go.
turn around or you're dead.
here.
him too.
i haven't caught it yet.
you got three seconds to turn around.
turn.
maybe this guy's never seen her.
almost there.
him?
kill.
give me the number.
don't!
stop!
no!
okay?
will, she's fine.
the trigger is dead.
it's over.
malcolm, feather.
yeah? yeah? yeah?
my wife is dead, isn't she?
harry, listen.
hannah, let us know.
harry?
hannah, why did harry take his ears off?
i don't know.
tell us.
get sco00 here, now.
0 trucks full of rx, 00 minutes in front of us, limhhouse north industry park.
how do you know?
qasim just told me.
bomb trucks are leaving in 00 minutes.
i think we got him.
let's go!
armed police!
stay where you are!
clear!
clear!
who saw the target?
negative!
negative!
negative, sir.
command center, area clear.
harry.
he sold his own guys.
why would he do that?
what did you do?
armed police!
freeze!
walk!
you have to tell them everything, harry.
i think we have a lot to talk about.
this might be a little out of line.
it's from the u.s. corner of duboisatz.
don't keep an eye on holloway.
make sure you're safe.
maybe we shouldn't be so painful.
did you find qasim?
harry will talk.
you still don't know him.
qasim gave up the whole operation.
what did you say to her?
i should have thought they'd release you after berlin.
they want to offer you a deal.
throw everything over harry and go.
i told them i'd quit after i did this.
no way out.
i can't.
there's a emergency backup key hanging around your neck.
whatever you're after...
what would ruth think?
what did you give him?
check the back.
it's the south corner.
i've found harry on the u.s. corner of dubaipizz.
the contrary.
where you trap someone.
harry?
i gave it to her.
get down!
get down!
get down!
lock us up.
get down!
get down!
we're not here for you!
we're here for them.
get down!
think of your parents.
hamza.
why?
there are 00 men on the other side of these doors.
you must surrender.
come here.
open it!
if you think we should negotiate...
open the door.
but he'll kill us.
there are many demons in a room.
the only way out of here alive is to surrender...
you think i want out?
how many people have started living in this room?
my people's lives.
your people?
they didn't ask you to kill them for them.
if you want a hostage...
i think he made it clear he wasn't interested in hostages.
i'm the general manager of mi0.
kill me and put the gun down.
otherwise, you're nothing but a dead terrorist.
no one will see you as a hero.
when we're done, you're gonna be a drunk, smashing his wife, tattooing her wife, and you're gonna be a
we'll give a couple of marrach boy hookers a couple of guys that go forward and beg them to do their jobs, and we'll give them free tickets to disneyland.
we can't remember you very well, can we, adam?
wait, wait, wait.
i got the chopper back.
but...
you fucking coward.
i thought you were fighting a higher standard.
i'm sorry for your wife's death, adam.
i know what this can do to you.
is that supposed to stop me?
it's okay.
stop!
why did you bring him here?
i made a choice.
without plan b.
why do you think i kept you out of your room?
people are still dead, harry.
there's less to die in the blast.
what kind of choice would you make?
this is my job.
auntie, can you come play outside?
hello, geraldine.
finally, it's time for you to know who's licking long lick.
right?
if we had protected that morning, qasim would never have escaped.
you ordered the met'in air unit to turn all mi0 demands back, didn't you?
that's the advantage of being a maniac.
i don't have to prove it.
sacrificing your own services so you could be an abusive problem by a stranger force.
no doubt the americans would have made you the general manager.
how many more lives was that promotion worth?
what did you think you thought you were doing, harry?
he's dying.
but if the moment i realized i was on the loser, my career would be too short.
blowing my brain, finding my 00-year-old nephew...
i think this came from you.
what is it?
it's got more than three hours of heat screaming, or it's just not being stopped.
no sign of him.
how clever.
i was afraid that would be the answer.
so i took your chance to make that choice.
it's not about lunch.
i ate shallow ribs.
tell me you're lying, harry.
please.
tell me you didn't betray your country.
it's already 0:00, geraldine.
you can spend the last three hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd play with your beautiful nephew.
i'm thinking.
your message said something to me.
they're watching ruth's grave.
you can't leave now.
i've actually got something you should have.
that's what your father was wearing the night he died.
he took everything to work out everything he worked so he could find a way to enter the fsb out of his body and the fsb.
he was wearing a wedding ring on the night of his operation?
i didn't throw you out because you're not good enough.
after your father, i couldn't...
i should have protected you.
they won't last forever, will.
then who?
people like me.
if you know what your problem is, and you tell people on the door, it helps.
there's room for every guest in the hotel middle school.
get together in one row.
these new problems kill in the dark.
these people will be grateful to you when it's dark down.
i think we should keep them here to keep them safe, but i'm worried things will get worse.
they have no idea who caused the dark problem.
and we don't have to worry about what's hidden in the dark.
we still haven't figured out how to handle that fog wall.
maybe it's a blessing.
this was the last part of the in-furflight purely.
i'm on your side and i might need a new job.
i'm under control, but if i can get another pillow for my beauty sleep, it's too much reasonable.
try to fix things.
we talked about this.
it's almost impossible to destroy one's problem without killing him.
yeah, i just need information that's impossible for the equipment i don't have that i don't have, and maybe i need information.
i'm gonna need a team.
any idea what's going on?
but there's a bad source.
it's the only way to protect the rest of us.
it's risky to drive because of the magnet problem.
an engineer to help fix the power plant.
she's willing to know that.
if things don't go well, you can use his problem for central.
what the hell are you doing?
the killer is out there somewhere.
and i guess he really wants to prove he wants to help you.
all right, whatever reason for whatever reason, just keep an eye on him for me, okay?
because neither of us has immune to new problems.
i'm not saying it's just because she's my mom
when you leave school, i'll call the person who caused the dark problem.
he stole those batteries and put us in danger.
there was no choice, dwight.
third case in two weeks.
now the serial killer is in this building.
all right, i'm gonna go talk to dwight.
my father always said you were a good man.
marara's father?
there may be a way, but if you want me to explain to you, it might look more frightening, so don't ask.
i can't even find maine, haven't found haven.
you're telling me you can't find a town with 00 thousand people?
that's not the problem.
then why didn't we use aether in the first place to finish the problems?
i can't bring it when the needles sealed.
so how do we find it?
gloria brought a box of stuff that duke left in gull.
i don't think william needs aether, and aether is just my first vaccine.
you told his wife he'd find her.
it's easy to decide from the side, but sometimes things don't look like they do.
i have a town to protect.
no wonder the plant works at 00 percent.
friends, i try, but in your mind, i've never done anything like this before.
they parked the car here to talk to you, but i don't even have enough money to pay for the oil change.
if all goes well, i'll go back with aether before sunset.
this is peggy's husband roll.
enough panic and fear.
the same killer who killed my son 00 years ago?
we call him the killer who never let him down.
what else are you hiding from me, vince?
dwight's doing his best to accept the rules, but he's not someone to kill those people.
in haven, it's the same as the death sentence.
thanks to our friend there, we keep them in some kind of prison.
he says the generator works at 00 percent.
damn it, when the generator overloaded the energy reserves must have unloaded their reservations.
well, that would explain the department's electric power to the town.
at this speed, like five minutes.
they're about to stop, and it's the only thing that protects us from dying in the dark.
well, i've re-enacted the generator's arrangements to get the power to the town faster, but there's nothing else we can do.
they better turn around.
help each other.
turn the lights around.
share your equipment.
you see, i'm happy here.
i got your message.
get in the car now.
come on, jump!
we should be thankful for it, even you and ian.
i don't think there's anything worse than being in love.
i don't like it here.
there are two sides of each story.
whoever's behind this is a traitor.
let's go.
he asked me to represent him at slan's wedding.
you're my brother's love.
that's why you're my sister.
you've seen a lot of bigger places in the realms than this place.
none of 'em were run by a woman.
you must choose a second person to keep you company and keep an eye out during the moon.
then you listen to your friends and relatives.
i have no relatives here.
my mother and the others will escort you.
kana, this is the palace of bregan.
rhea, do i always have to be protected?
i don't get it.
but i know i have to marry slean.
i'll love her.
this marriage cannot happen.
the abreancan trusts you.
what do you do?
carpenter.
they could use you on the wall then.
who are you?
a friend of the council.
like i said, i have things to take care of.
we need to figure out how to handle it.
varr said i couldn't accept the gift.
then we stay between us.
every bride should smell good when the wedding time comes.
remember, this is our secret.
sit.
we'll take what we'll get when we're looking at the wounded.
you wanted to talk?
all right.
kana, it's time for your month.
elvina, will you be the second person next to me?
play.
we need to talk sometime.
we have to discuss why marriage doesn't work.
if we don't replace our mission, their marriage cancel.
beowf!!!
let's celebrate.
old tradition!
the dress smells grim.
i'm so sorry.
it was just a little mistake.
that's all.
we're going to help ian give the bride the bride back.
that sounds easy.
breakca!
open the door!
come, you stinking mudborn.
come!
come!
give me your arm.
come!
ian.
quiet, kana's sleeping.
are they ready for this marriage?
i didn't understand why slan didn't want to marry kana.
i don't think so.
he should put his feelings aside and do what's best for everyone.
would you put it aside for others?
that's what we all have to do.
if somebody's gonna live their whole life pleasing others, that person doesn't actually live.
it must make you feel pretty free to think like that.
try.
tell every rock the truth.
but then you can look at each other and burn the fire that simulates your marriage.
then you'll be husband and wife.
have you loved someone before?
no.
before you come here...
you wanna be a shane?
tell my uncle i'm done with him.
allah.
come!
go!
you let her go.
we're not done here.
don't you understand?
i betrayed my mother and made sandwiches with my uncle.
this woman was sent here to kill you!
i don't know.
yeah?
i killed my brother.
he was the one who should have been there today.
even if the world was destroyed, mara had everything.
people loved her because she was kind.
my father loved him for his first child.
rowan and lovers.
then i had a chance to escape from there.
i wouldn't need anything.
he was dead, but he was.
he was getting better.
i poisoned him.
ian, i won't tell anyone what they did here today and what happened.
or stay.
i know, but it's beowulf.
he went into his bed the other night.
but we can choose who we can draw our fate with.
fire with me.
you want to be a shane?
i can help you.
against those who show up.
they can't take it from you anymore, rheda.
you're with this marriage, you're sheldlands earl.
jarl's rules need to be used by every nightmare.
if her blood money isn't paid, a killer's life will be over.
the thieves will be stuck out of society.
the price of the trade at sheldlands' trade will be made by jarl earl.
what's the right to set the fish price?
we're the ones who risked their lives to catch every summer panic.
you should have told me about these rules.
you were where your people needed you most, you were on duty.
i couldn't distract you.
it was messy enough.
you're late for the billboard.
some people think you kidnapped her again.
but if you fail, bryan will be in a miserable misery and starve.
breca's wanted for murder, you know that.
kill it!
kill breca!
i got it!
you do that without any explanation, we all die.
he hired us to deliver breeca to his blood after he escaped from the wormhole.
did we ask the guy who helped her escape the first time?
that's why we'll welcome it.
but breakca should stay with us.
while we're talking, hector may be hanging on our doors!
when did we kill young women?
what do you mean?
you've been hiding in the shadows too long, abrean.
remember who you talk to.
talk.
he wants breca's life or blood money for the murder of his sister.
i didn't mean to kill anyone.
hurry!
thank you.
breakca's in love with her.
he thinks it's money, and then he's stealing the money and running away, you asshole.
he left my mother and took everything that was precious.
my sister went after him.
but it cost your life.
breca, is it true?
i'll pay for your sister's blood money.
lila, do you have 00 silver?
i don't want money, i want blood!
silence!
if his blood money's paid for, it'll break free.
you lied to me.
panic.
panur!
tie it now.
get ready, they're coming.
i saw it.
get out!
the council is here.
he wants to take my place while i'm hogging me for the panic.
you let me down, she married slainan keela, and rhea's gone!
you don't understand.
tell the council that our enemies are gathering, that your sister is not in rule, that you want to save sheields.
so tell me you're distracted.
tell me.
i'm sorry.
i knew breca killed someone, but the story she told me was different.
it's just his fault.
lila, nobody thinks bad things about you...
that's all i got.
did you bring it?
there's no 00 silver.
not enough.
i'll keep breca while i see his job.
was there enough money?
lila???????
shut the subject down, please.
you're not talking to lila.
get on your horse, leave heorot and don't come back.
there's no place for you here.
i want to fight properly if heotor is to be attacked.
i'll protect you if heotor attack.
let's try.
it's not about mudborn.
i don't want to talk about it.
i want to know why you lied to me about training me.
it's a baby when you use it.
you don't even want to be careful.
yeah?
i didn't know we trained the blacks!
go.
now!
he's fighting girls now?
the view was more like training the ironicl.
i know you think i let you down.
that i couldn't focus on my things in bryan.
but i have reasons.
you're talking about betraying someone from your own blood.
this land needs a warrior!
someone to get your people out of the dark.
a man in power to take control!
you're talking about betraying your sister to hide the truth you can't afford your needs.
what's the point of having fish if we're all going to be slaughtered?
i'm here to vote confidentiality.
what's happening against abreancan being a shane.
decided.
he's gonna have a new thane and he's gonna be reported in the morning.
get up.
next.
no one.
don't think that!
we were lazy, distracted.
this is gonna work out here.
from now on, we'll work like my dad hrothgar.
i didn't mean to interrupt.
you're a good teacher.
a big shane wants a strong army behind him.
we don't have to share the same bed, but if we don't share the same room, people will start talking.
i always liked watching heorot from here.
it seems invincible.
i tell my mother the truth, i lose her trust.
and also my chance to rule one day.
what if abreancan attack?
heot may fall.
aren't you going to advise?
i trust you.
your decision will be correct.
i'll be there when i do.
you'll be shane.
you just have to believe.
panic.
panur!
that's panic!
play the debt!
i command you, play the debt!
abrecan, give it up.
if we don't act immediately, our opportunity will escape.
why...
you help me carry the network.
help me move the network now.
why don't you help me?
panur!
hurry!
go find me a bag.
people shouldn't leave their precious things in the middle of nowhere.
you owe my mom an apology.
but i'm a warrior and our honor is at stake.
so i'll take your life.
go back to mommy, little girl.
greetings.
i didn't need your help.
because he didn't have enough money to save you.
be thankful you didn't kill him, vishka.
if we can't plant the network, our prey will escape.
no, he won't.
get ready.
abrecan, no!
hold the rope!
hurry, you chew!
billi, panic!
billi, panic!
hold on!
and the rest now!
take a look.
they're gonna sing about this hunt.
a hunt you win.
i have a dream about us.
being the biggest rude in sheldlands!
we're not even gonna obey the law a j earl puts in a sword that can't hold a sword.
who's with me?
abreancan, abreancan, abrecan!
i have to warn beowf.
bryan!
elvina!
the warriors are coming together.
to destroy us this time.
beowf!!!
we turn around today and look at our perimeter, we see you come from more danger and harm's religious faith.
if i talked about soviet communism or the brutality of stalin, my wife would be less ashamed.
it's the sort of interrogation of the species of interrogations that question people's troubles for people, especially this situation.
it's a serious damage to present a situation that's perfectly perfectly perfection within himself, and it can cause serious damage.
when the prophecy doesn't happen, we make fun of those people and the whole world mock us.
i had a friendly idea for this problem with richard dawkins.
maybe richard and i should be more aggressive.
especially with christian convincing and yellow or something.
they're sure the world is what their religion says.
we'll get rid of the bad guys.
i'd like to write a book like this, if i could.
but one of my fears will be later.
what kind of mess?
how true is it that you're trying to do this to people who think that the civilization of our civilization and the good in our drink is to protect them?
listen, for a lot of people, ahlaki's like vagina.
if that's true, if religion is sending people's morals to their morals, then somebody's gonna have to go out and get us some serious, and you're gonna have to get back to work.
because a lot of people can stay and we can create a chaos from the fear of these people.
a lot of people want their lives to mean something and where does that come from?
but there must be something better than that.
yeah, there's definitely hope.
let's see what happens?
of course.
at least you didn't get piercings.
i don't know how to explain it to amy.
i'm the stupidest man in the world.
all right, stop it.
i'm the stupidest man in the world.
okay, you win this.
i can't find emma's papers.
honey, just so you know you can't return the baby unless you've found the hang of the fuckin' thing.
i need to know if angela signed emma to my door when she let me close to emma, and the only deputy attorney gave me the paper.
i'm finally gonna get me some health insurance that i'm finally responsible for looking at myself and looking at.
i haven't talked to her since the night we did emma.
calm down.
you gave me all the important papers to keep me safe.
you have all the papers?
her father's little girl's father had a big daughter.
it could be a balloon thing.
that's so close!
clown?
today is your birthday!
my birthday first tomorrow.
you used to party when you were a kid.
i don't like celebrating my birthday...
happy birthday miles."
those papers i was hiding for me.
how irresponsible do you think i am?
but i...
i may not be able to post them in time, and i can't post them, and i don't think emma might have one.
we were all excited because the new baby came here, and i didn't have any drops!
look, i don't mind if we sign angela this paper again.
you're the only person who's seen ben's best friend because you're the only person who's seen her...
i love it, it's okay.
all right, emma finally asleep.
look, danny, what's the reason riley doesn't want to celebrate his birthday?
really, why does he hate it so much?
ben, riley didn't celebrate her birthday after her 00-year-old birthday party last night.
are you sure you want to watch this?
i think i'd remember if it was a disaster.
all right, come on, guys.
danny, where are we going?
fortunately, your future was a real mustache, and he lost the weight of a person.
is ben here?
benjamin wheeler, come here and celebrate riley's birthday.
well, i can tell you that this is the best birthday i've ever had.
tell the cake you didn't do anything.
actually, first, try to save the perm and then cut it out.
is riley still in love with ben or is that something that happened when he was a kid?
unless you're still in love with riley.
i embarrassed her 00-year-old party.
it's not on your birthday secrets, but the rest of the time he loves you.
if ben's so irresponsible to lose the papers and he's too scared to face me, maybe he doesn't deserve to take the honor of emma.
if it makes you feel any better, we do most of the work.
i can imagine how hard it was to leave emma.
i knew you'd finally upset her if you thought how beautiful, funny, funny, funny, funny or wonderful or wonderful or wonderful

madox-00 is also a very high-ranking fight for the limited weapons we understand.
what's more, he has more power than a uh-00 blackshawk.
it's both anti-terteromist and ant-gerilla operations for their antimatter operation.
ms. vomoumoto is also the lead in the software for "dankter."
in the show today's show today, madox's ability to show up with the light of the mugs and the light of the lamp.
unit 0 will go to ichigya tonight.
we're in a hurry, see if you're as quick as you can.
and...
mrs. vomumoto, you made me very small today.
i'm not here for congratulations.
i'll tell you only one thing:
wow!
kouji...
which is what?
onose, you leave this to me!
they threw away their trash.
i'm telling you don't worry.
i'll buy you dinner in return, won't i?
sdf's transport car...
report reports were natural...
obvious terrorist business.
you're far too wild for the operations of the east-blasting operation.
i hope you know what you're saying!
i hope you see the burden of the win is completely yours.
in any case, the situation we're in is very critical.
we had her transferred for the field test!
it's!!
i've got to be in the operation.
besides, madox-00.
while we're investigating the scene, the cars are giving us trouble.
i wonder if we should get backup on the police?
he has to prepare ourselves for the worst and keep his troops ready.
i'm the only one who can get up against madox and get high.
although lieutenant kilgore is one of the "enal bellalineal" part of our best tank in the army.
-is this place okay?
nobody in the apartment?
anyway, i feel a little relaxed.
she was really pretty...
all the boys in japan will mourn the time he goes to england.
where did you learn that?
she called me in the morning and asked me to give you a message.
use the opener to open them up.
it's burning!
he could've set the pilot up.
makes him feel like he's wearing a boot for skateboard.
we've got an activated signal from madox.
it's a catastrophe.
could you heat the microwave?
i really embarrassed myself!
shori, what do you intend?
defense?
you're on duty to the tank of the proto air discount company.
and don't you dare to turn tokyo into vietnam!
i mean, in traitor of tokyo ha, that's the same challenge for me.
you'll cause the face.
oh, come on, don't worry.
i can't handle the issue without pissing too much.
lieutenant kilgore is using the most advanced tank and anti-tank chopper chopper, using my word to buy madox's duty.
in this case, the big panic will happen at city center.
in these circumstances, there must be someone who can stop kilgore and madox.
what can we do?
we don't know the madox target yet.
if i can find her before i can find her before lieutenant kilgore, then maybe i'll have a chance.
but madox's situation...
♪ i'm using the exocomp #0.
how much for success?

sister, it's more complicated than you think, okay?
where'd you get that?
i found it somewhere.
the dog's 00 cops, all of a sudden, turned up.
that's the smartest job you've ever done in your life!
what are you gonna do with this baby now?
you give to the cops?
do i change my mind and go back?
i look like a pedophile.
no, they'll send me home or something, right?
a woman leaves her own child on the train!
as you can see, she doesn't want him.
now i'm gonna change your pants!
i'll look after the gun for you, okay?
will you help me find her mother?
i have more important things to do than deal with this nonsense.
you give me the gun, i'll hide it somewhere, okay?
give me your orders.
what did you put there, man?
take it!
no, just call me when this nonsense is over, okay?
because we have work to do, okay, faggne?
daddy you!

sir?
i got it, man.
frankly, i'm a little tense, dear.
why are you getting nervous?
we'll figure it out.
well, i was talking to vince...
this is a child that mother doesn't want.
what are you doing, brother?
what's wrong with you, man?
why are you acting like a bitch?
who are you, my brother, jeremy kyle or something?
you can't sell someone else's baby to someone else!
especially vince and carol.
the other day, we were selling hooker whores!
no, you didn't, because i don't want to, man.
they'll give this kid another vince and carol.
let me go, sister.
i said i'd handle it, man.
what am i gonna tell people now?
yeah, yeah, good.
i do, but don't tell anyone we're here!
just take half, give me the rest of it.
i can't believe you sold a baby!
you didn't want it before, did you?
if i'm gonna go through all this stress, i'm gonna lose the money, and i'm gonna lose everything, then you need to talk to somebody, okay?
a nice lady.
i'm like, "fuck me."
what's going on there?
you're selling drugs at the bar, aren't you?
you or your stupid brother took my gun and i need that gun.
you got three hours to get my gun back, or i'll blow people's houses.
i'm leaving.
it's all messing up, right?
why are you bringing this whore to my place while my wife's upstairs?
what's going on?
he had a strong russian mob problem with a hard russian mob everywhere.
he thought they were gonna kill the baby.
that's why he left the baby on the train.
now, take this money, i'll give you the rest when i meet ed.
this isn't a fuckin' hook, vince, you know that!
you don't get it when you don't have a dick in your mouth, do you?
i don't mind you fucking in my mouth!
no, she said your wound was in her mouth.
i'm not giving them baby!
they can't take them anyway!
take it easy, okay?
now go up and get that baby!
over here!!!!!!
my gun man!
just know he's dead to give you this.
they may not let you go because your family is gone.
what flowers do you have, a suggestion?
white roses are good, right?
fuck!
fuck off!
are you the owner of this car?
but you stopped me.
but first, let's get our glasses to the new owner, chester.
to chester.
i hope that, as i've done all these years, this wonderful monsters will tremble over the beasts.
cheers.
i promise i will raise the standard of this show and you will be proud.
have a nice trip to where dreams come true.
thank god.
if that old-fashioned german is gone, then we'll have the rule.
maroriie, it's so...
thank you, chester.
now, if you'll excuse me, family, monsters, and weirdly spend the last moments of the world alone.
bye.
there's someone else to thank.
mr. richard spencer.
our lives have changed completely.
cheers.
mm!!!!!!!
but tonight we'll have a nice feast tonight, then we'll be watching a movie from my collection.
not the sign of the cross again.
no.
we're gonna watch freaks tonight.
you know this movie, richard?
i don't know.
it's a great movie.
tell it to home, paul.
ah.
cleopatra marries a normal trapz artist, and the little shows are married to a midget.
but the real purpose is to poison him and bring him to the miracle.
he plays all the freaks in his finger at his finger until one day he's got a lot of drunk and he's gonna be hiding his true intentions.
then all freaks become enemies to him.
one night with knives and guns, they get revenge.
home.
darling... don't lose your pleasure.
sounds great!
there's a lot to do before we get to the west road.
i can't.
shut up and sit down.
you deserve it.
what happened to you?
come on, richard, pick up.
i thought long enough about you doing that.
oh, thank god.
we had clients who hadn't thought of our show, but no one's ever been fainted.
are you okay, ma'am?
where are those security guards?
good to know.
now it's your turn.
jesus christ.
i don't even know that.
i told them everything...
stanley.
elsa...
come...
talk to them.
hollywood!
i'm afraid... that's all you say.
just a dream.
come on, turn it over.
aah!!ah!!!!
god...
no.
please.
my cousin garden works in god.
but you brought death here... and you have to pay for it.
put that down.
come on, come on.
elsa, come on... we need to talk in private.
i believe we'll find a common point.
you think you can run now?
i'm right.
he killed her.
he's not who you think he is.
and start running.
run!
run!
run!
just because you're daddy grown up now doesn't mean you have to make romantic work.
how did he die?
who did?
we all did.
chewed.
now.
come on.
it was my father!
a freak killed him!
and the most delicate of us.
you believe his word?
are you a fraud?
i saw dear ma petite in a jar with my own eyes.
i heard you waste it on my ears.
as for maggie, if she didn't help maggie, we'd have more bodies.
i won't forgive him.
all i want is to rot in hell.
you're gonna be friends with whoever comes up now.
maggie's gonna change her bandages.
no!
you're dirty.
now that your mother isn't here, it's up to me to protect you and protect you.
i saw you turn from childhood to man, man to man, and we need you.
i have none!
i can't even pee on my own.
i got an old friend.
he'll come and help you.
he's a real artist.
but first the wounds have to heal.
maggie's gonna help you.
let him.
i'm so sorry.
i hate hurting you.
really?
i thought your only talent was to hurt people.
i love you, jimmy.
this part is real.
i always have.
i want to start a new beginning.
we can go to new york like we're still planning.
why not?
you're kidding, right?
you think after all you've done, we're just gonna sail to the new uukes?
my hands... are in a fucking jar, and you are responsible for all this.
i'm so sorry.
can you get petite back from the dead?
huh?
i've changed, jimmy.
ah!
i knew you were stupid, let's add a blind to the list, okay?
find me somebody who can focus on the lamp's focus!
i can't leave.
i have to set the right light for the first time, okay?
try again!
scheissse!
elsa.
sure.
he's watching us.
can't we lift it?
just this once?
please?
okay.
yeah.
mm.
oh.
thank you, chester.
you threw me on the floor.
like an old sock.
i'm sorry, martha.
i got myself a little... but i'm happy now.
they have magic, you have them.
maybe i should go.
we can handle it, martha.
the twins accept you.
they just don't want you watching them do anything.
they're using you, chester.
you're their boss now.
no, they don't.
they love me.
you're a murderer.
no.
no.
mar thane.
i know you don't like to talk about it, so don't open it, but you killed them.
alice and lucy.
impossible.
i'm just a puppet.
hmm.
love destroy you, chester.
you're losing control.
i know...
i'm a monster.
you don't need them.
i'm in.
i know.
please don't leave me, martha.
twins?
they have to go.
i know.
they will.
ethel looks great here with the koro girls.
oh, this is her barnum days.
she was a unique woman.
ethel.
ethel.
so what do you say?
didn't anyone hear what spencer said last night?
now it's all over.
elsa killed ethel.
forest.
car accident.
it was all the counter.
i believe that.
that crazy, jealous woman threw a knife at my paul.
it was elsa's only problem.
i couldn't sit in my head anyway.
i know ethel.
he wasn't the one to kill himself.
it's not a coward.
he wouldn't do that to his own kid, and of course we would.
and he'd leave a proper note.
if somebody comes after one of us, we know what to do.
our future has only one security.
that's elsa's life.
have you ever imagined that you could feel that way, dot?
thank god you said the marjoriie thing.
all he had to do was push him.
i think we certainly made a good impression.
good evening, girls.
what are you doing here?
i'm here to hand out friendly xindi.
i've had some information... about your last mission.
we don't want to hear anything from you.
leave kindly.
oh, dot, i can't blame you.
i had a terrible attitude the other day.
but the last events caused my to soften.
i lost my mom.
very sudden and... terrible.
she's very upset, mandy.
it's terrible for everyone to lose their mother.
it was.
it is.
and it made me feel that i shouldn't let my loved ones go after what i love.
but i think you should know we met a man.
actually, i got your news.
i can't imagine how dying it would be to marry you.
if i had a chance to wrap everything...
i came with friendly feelings.
i know i lost my chance.
i'm not half the man you deserve.
but i asked myself.
"daddy, what do you have to do to support those girls you love so much?"
then i thought i might protect you and so i hired a proper man so you could get some information on your new friend.
my heart broke my heart because your chester crab just came out of a maniac!
we don't need these.
what's wrong with you?
you're a pain in the ass, and we don't trust you as much as our sins.
ta-ta then.
i did my best.
my mother always said that when a woman was angry, she would argue with him.
who is it?
son.
here.
drink.
what's that?
penis.
i hated seeing you die of infection when i said we'd complete you.
who are you?
my name is massimo dolfino.
i'm here to make you your new hands.
okay?
massimo is an old friend of mine from before the war.
it's over the art.
oh, no.
i saw soldiers with a hand bomb in their hands.
they put their hands in those cool hookers.
i can't pull 00 or anything, but at least i can keep my own cigarettes.
besides, i don't have to be afraid of wood dryers by the end of my life.
massimo's offering you something more shocking than rusty hooks.
more convincing.
look.
see?
the other one.
massimo saved my life.
your mother died of drink, and she would have left you on the streets.
i could marry her if you weren't so stupid.
"my only sin..."
si.
"... loved you..."
and so very very very very very very much
no!
they were members of a organization.
and if he's a leader, he's a doctor you know.
go to the other now, don't rush this time.
for two years,
massimo took care of me.
she taught me to walk.
and dance.
then he fell off.
nememberg, rhineland...
we had to escape while we still had our chance.
we had a plan.
how could i look into the eyes of my love when i knew those monsters were free?
they had to pay.
i took them all one by one.
aah!!ah!!!!
finally, i've reached the leader.
ah, head of monsters.
dr hans grouper.
it shouldn't have been a painless death.
obviously my death wouldn't be painless.
it took me so personal to want to kill him.
very personal.
he tortured me.
he locked me in a cell and tortured me again, and again.
how did you get out?
i lived in osterlich until the end of the war.
then i came to america- 00.
and i called miss mars for years.
but i couldn't answer.
if you loved her so much, and you knew where she was, why didn't you come up to your feet?
my body was tortured but...
i was like pinocchio.
i had nothing to do with the humanity.
but, uh...
beautiful iron.
beautiful iron.
i know you guys have been together so long, and it might be hard to make changes for a sit-down show.
and i repeat- this has nothing to do with ego.
for this keep...
it looks so normal.
i don't think we can judge him after we have absolutely no evidence.
what about the file?
it says he killed his wife.
you're letting dy's lies drop the shadow off your account.
dot and i have something to say.
we don't want your assistant anymore.
why?
we just don't want to.
maybe when you hear my final, you change your mind.
two bodies, two heads.
it's gonna sound so loud.
it's a first in magic history.
come on, girls... let's rehearse.
we're not going in that box.
no, chester... we're not going in that box.
now with your...
i will.
you...
i can be your assistant.
it is.
in the box, lucy.
my name is maggie.
oop!
is that magic?
looks a little pathetic.
shut up.
i didn't say anything.
what are you looking at?
back stage.
it's called the original 'shi' t.e.
tonight you'll be watching a very dangerous version of this play that belongs to me.
handcuffs.
hey, i...
i don't know this part.
i went to war for you.
you should have died there.
we loved each other.
you came from there with bees in your head in a metal plate and in your head.
chester, stop, i can't move my feet!
stop!
stop talking!
you're distracting me.
stop, maroriie.
you haven't ruined my life enough?
you're nothing without me.
i'll show you.
all of you.
chester!
chester!
chester, stop!
what are you doing?
relax, people... it's just magic show.
magic show.
i could bring her back.
again...
alakazam!
brotherra...
brotherrabra.
this is gonna be a lot of people, chester.
he made me do this.
he deserved it.
what do we do now?
steal his jewels and bury the bitch.
why are you gathering?
you ruined everything again.
time to go.
you confused me.
you did this consciously to sabotage me.
i finally found happiness.
i'm leaving.
you can't leave without me.
oh.
i loved you.
chester...
oh, god...
mariorie?
stay with me.
mar thane.
in front of you, the elsa's forensic lungs, dayton, ohio, you know, this one-time, my favorite shit-loved son, and this one of my favorite prank-o, and this one of my first-a-a-a-a-s-s-a-s-s
jimmy darling!
i'm not a stage artist like you, mom.
listen to your mother.
you've got a very good smile and a great weather.
you're in star quality, jimmy.
now get your ass up on the stage and show your mother why she's proud of you.
jimmy.
maggie's dead.
you want details?
elsa's next.
tonight.
looks like... now you'll have a chance... in real life.
jimmy...
good for you.
how dare you come in without knowing!
what do you want?
you have to go.
they've been planning revenge all day at ethel's trailer.
they'll kill you.
why should i believe you, huh?
my monsters love me.
i'm like their mother.
ethel was more like their mother than you.
you killed their real mother.
the last nonsense of a desperate man.
now who's desperate?
you saw what they did to her.
but where do i go?
anywhere but here.
you could have saved me.
we just did.
there you are.
what's jimmy doing?
he'd be here, too, if he had the two.
it's time.
give me that.
meat!
let's get some... justice.
oh.
thanks for coming.
i never refuse a woman in a difficult situation.
i'm in no condition.
but i'm in a hurry.
oh.
i want to report a murder.
who was killed?
a young woman.
put it over there.
slowly.
put your hands where we can see them.
i did.
send me away.
what are you doing here?
i've come to count.
i'm the new owner here.
where is elsa?
gone.
she went after her dreams.
elsa sold us again.
$00,000 in cash.
nothing.
everything here, including your contracts, belongs to me now.
and i want to see what's mine.
was it always your dream, sir?
world show?
dream.
yeah.
and now it's turning real.
thirsty.
go get me a lemonade with a pipe.
yes, sir.
are you ready?
yeah.
they're perfect.
i want to try it now.
sure.
the other.
you.
thank you.
but jesse james escaped and hid for two years.
in the great halls, the u.s. army sitting in the u.s. army sitting bulla's chips and beat the army at the black hill in southota.
after the defeat of the united states government after the battle of bighornorn, the united states government has chosen to starve its people to starve and kill them.
hold the line!
but despite the little war against the u.s. army, the indian's challenge was getting worse.
the lakotta leader sitting bull and crazy horse's options were short.
you're a man with a strong heart.
but i'm tired.
see you.
and despite the violence they see and their indian generals destroyed their culture and they don't give up.
to go back there in those times, living things meant catching a chance to get rich.
a lot of women and men have tried their luck.
the united states has been the first country to save herself from global buhran when the gold's seen it.
it was found in the west.
texas had a lot of shallow beef since a long time across the mexico border.
but it wasn't possible they could have moved up to the irons until they complete the iron planets and took people to the east.
in texas, they were sold 00 bucks on the east coast, 00 bucks a day.
they bought the beef barons at the big section of california, california, where they bought the big part of the authenticity area.
these landlords had an incredible chance for their own.
we're talking about millions of heredity land, farms, and thousands of different animals.
one of the shallow thieves in the new mexico area was going to turn into one of their famous guys who was the evil of the bat.
his story started 0,000 miles east.
billy never knew his father.
they moved to new mexico with her mother in the early '00s.
for years, there have been no reason.
what do you want?
whiskey.
leave the bottle.
there were different kinds of cowboys.
always sitting around the corner.
that's what you should be paying attention.
billy used what he did best to make it through.
billy the kid used a really good gun.
he spent every dollar he'd ever won for practice.
only the strong ones in a place like this survive.
where are you going?
lincoln.
i'm just passing through here.
these are from john tunstall.
then john tunstall can come and get their beef back.
it'll help you to let me go.
i don't think so.
i don't think you have a choice.
the young thieving thief billy the kid was caught by a ranch he tried to steal his beef.
most people shoot where they see their shallow thieves.
you still haven't told me who you're working for.
i'm not working for anyone.
everyone in lincoln town works for somebody, son.
yeah, but i don't work.
you looked like a used man to get me what you wanted.
you're right.
there's only one problem.
you got a lot of guys.
you got another place?
billy the kid needed work when he came to lincoln.
john tunstall needed cowboys.
john tunstall came to the west to win a fortune.
lincoln's moved into town where he could make money.
but some of these success's made some powerful men angry.
lincoln was one of the wildest places in the wild bath.
he was in the house of ev's control of everything from the shallow price, their land, their land and their government duty.
they even paid for their law's salary.
most of the people who lived in lincoln had them as a bully.
john tunstall came into town for a long time, and he put his nose into the work of a beef with the one in ev's house.
no one could be on the side.
billy, when john henry tunstall went into business with him, he became the man of tunstall.
in a few months, young law had become the most trusted armed man in tunstall.
for the first time in her life, my young orphan felt like he was in the west house.
the tunst, billy was a mind teacher for the kid.
pass me your plate, billy.
thank you.
i'm starving.
it's going very well, son.
i'm glad you're here with me.
thank you.
billy always had a hard time.
many were seen as a set of feet.
billy's an incredible and life was a change of life.
billy the billy kid, when he was using the fuel that he used to use as the fuel he was using as the fuel he was using as a fuel, he came to stop a few miles north of the west.
calm down, guys.
i'm selling my left hand as a friendship suggestion.
if he hadn't done that, most of us wouldn't be here today.
we were going to die fighting instead of going to the region.
they actually took people's souls when they put us in the
he trusts me.
he's talking to me.
jesus christ.
this policy is known as "massimation."
but i think they wanted to make us unprotected.
there was a promise used in the military.
"k." kill the man and protect the man."
if you destroy the indian culture, you'd be a better person.
they thought we were wild.
the proud lakota warrior knew he'd have to foot again for the people of war.
"i'm probably not happy here."
"i'm not happy here."
"we don't want to live in the field."
you're not used to life in the space area.
give it time.
i'm sure you'll like it in time.
after i offered their objections to the united states authorities, the soldier began to fear that the lakota warrior would start a new indian foot.
the united states was terrified of mad horse.
it was said mad horse wanted to kill a general who came to visit himself.
the united states authorities were worried about a new footing rumor.
while the crazy horse is spreading something that he's planning something to do, he's gone to meet the authorities to clear the lakota warrior's name.
crazy horse thought the united states authorities would see him.
he didn't notice the situation before.
they wanted to put her in prison cell.
then he pulled out his knife.
though i think the most trusted comment, white united states guard, killed him by a sponge.
mad horse wasn't killed in the battlefield.
his vision was right.
it was expected by the guard.
on the 0th of september 0000, the man who fought to protect his life for the crazy horse, and killed the man who fought against the united states.
it's very hard to talk about mad horse's death because even this year, it's too fresh.
one of the most enchanting and most magical side of the inheritance of mad horse and his inheritance is that there are some of the indian people who aren't in the american history of american history.
today, it is seen as a symbol of the brave brave resistance against the united states government's government, and is talking about his respect.
i think that's why he's so powerful.
in the death of mad horse's death, the lakota people have waited for a leader who could save the rest of their desperate culture.
until you pay for catron, their referee was interested in him.
this is for you.
what if he resistance?
i don't care how.
it's just my business.
copy that.
go check it out.
you stay here.
okay.
what's your hurry, guys?
we heard the gunshot.
really?
don't do anything stupid, kid.
this has nothing to do with you.
it'll help keep it that way.
there's always the interrogation break-ups between this competition.
but like most ideas in the west, it became personal.
when someone was killed, they took a personal deal.
that was john henry tunstall.
he was killed because of the business disruption.
it was a personal matter now.
billy, with john tunstall's death, he was on his way to find his killers.
this road would take her to be the legend of a blanket legend of an un known armed cowboy.
as they continue to expand the country, the billy the kidnappers realized that the border wasn't running by law.
but there was a man in the 00 miles of new mexico ready to bring the law into the west.
it wasn't more dent in the wattarp e.v.o.s where men get whatever they want, and every day they took what they wanted and every day, and it wasn't more dent-
he was a big man for the 00th century standard.
he was so excited with his size.
he was one of thousands of americans who raided to the west to be watt earparp rich.
we were caught by the west disease, not the watt.
he always felt he had to force the next line.
it could have been an adventure, real estate, real estate research, and anything that could have been brought in.
and that's how the watt's life took.
he did all the work on the border to get it.
he's been doing a lot of single-handed stuff for the pacific u.s. u.s. u.s. u.s.b.s. to hunt down the rays from the floor floor
they'd have to take the beef to the city as soon as they're back to the city in the east, to get them back to the crowds, they'd have to drive back to the miles.
that's how the fast magic cities came out.
a view of the unarmed land was suddenly turning 00 rooms into a hotel.
young men who managed to come to these cities were drinking whiskey and carrying guns.
so there were plenty of young boys with good drink and a gun.
that's one reason the west was wild.
het saw that there was no law in dodge city, and there was violence in the disposal.
he had a hard life.
they'd go back east or worse.
but he was feeling a lot more in the watt earp fate.
he was going to prove to me that there would be a important place in dodge city in history.
you fooled the wrong man.
that's my money.
this guy's a cheat.
calm down.
cheating.
calm down.
he cheated.
put the gun down.
did you see his gun?
everyone saw you reach for your gun.
give me that.
i'll shoot you!
come on.
dodge city needs a desperate lawman.
watt earp was perfect for this.
it hasn't been long since we've been throwing cops at watt earp's dodge city.
you didn't have to take a private training to be a lawman.
that's not how it works in this city.
watt earp wouldn't ask questions.
"in a car and whip" is a sign that comes from him.
watt earp, dodge city was famous as soon as possible.
he would have become one of the most famous figure of the blanket he'd ever played the law.
'cause the line chickens give dad nightmares.
where were you?
and this was irving berlin's white christmas.
it's the most christmas christmas song all of all time's all the time
what? what?????
irving berlin actually wrote more than 0000.
then marry her.
what's wrong with you?
i don't mind.
you've got the type to sing.
what does that mean?
what are you doing this vacation season?
hey, baby.
where are you going?
father melley called.
i have to guard the stage of christ in church.
i have to cook something for the cooking.
did you hear me complaining?
what's up with poinsettia?
i forgot again!
you're a very hard man!
i can't create something in a hostile environment!
i wouldn't be hostile if you had two talent!
if you kick me again, i'm leaving.
your legs are filthy.
how's it going?
so i brought you some soup and thick jackets.
yeah, i'll call her.
horribly ordinary!
awful!
of course not!
yeah, and you know i'm a jew at eight.
good.
i'm gonna go get a bagel or something.
i'm going to dinner protection again.
i'm picking up a phone to shanghai garden.
but i'll decide what i decide to do!
i only have three days to cake!"
not really sound like that, but whatever.
gum!
i was gonna cake, but i had to work late.
and i'm done.
i mean, thank you, greek!
says who?
larry's wife won't bring her.
he's making a great cake!
you know what he's doing?
any chance you're in that town?
i really thought you were gonna make the cake!
aren't i a wife?
she'll never be with you, you know why?
because he'll have to take his own arm.
stop it!
great!
i'm so pure.
what are you doing?
looks like you started me.
kitchen robot, big eyebrow...
let me think.
nice, easy cake recipe.
how about that chocolate-chocolate bar?
at least i'm wearing the perfect shirt shirt into my pants...
a monkey could do it.
i love you.
i love you.
i imagine we're huge?
no.
you should've put more farting dust.
you don't even know what a attitude is!
and nobody wants to buy this stupid toy cake!
we'll take the food sale at a closed plate.
okay.
my whales have never been this far.
come here!
isn't it?
after all that...
well, try this.
a chat.
no problem.
we don't make traditional food sale.
we're doing something more fun.
all right.
great plan!
i didn't count the cake walk!
i've never seen karamel do this.
it's a candy-fried couch, mind!
come on.
hi, ling.
i have your spiritual problem.
well, when i...
elaine?
whatever.
i see it, but it's heavy.
how long has this been going on?
what does that mean?
i think you're in love.
how do i get rid of it?
i got myself together.
i'm ready to sing.
i'm looking for my soul tonight.
i know there's a lot more to life waiting for me.
thank you for accepting me.
how can i help?
my wife cindy died two years ago.
we were married for three years.
it hit a car in our anniversary.
cindy and i wanted to have kids.
like, she's dead.
how are you gonna do that?
or did eggs leave his embryo?
no.
did you hear me?
i heard.
to clone your dead wife?
scientists are tryin' this under hand, mr. cage.
so i sneak up on cindy.
my sister-in-law heard that and hired a lawyer to stop it.
that's why i need a lawyer.
he's going to court today.
yes, but, mr. stoller, i must say i'm sure your wife was a wonderful person.
but clones?
please.
there's nowhere else i can application.
your company met this lawyer before.
who?
larry paul.
i hear you're so successful.
it was.
how can you have a holodeck relationship?
a relationship means communication.
what about "oo"?
i know you don't like it, but if he's not in the stupid stupid stick, he can't control the male.
you're the only problem.
i don't know.
really?
and you came here to talk about my holodeck?
i came to borrow something.
but forget it.
ally?
can you take a look?
the lawyer's attorney, larry.
yeah?
there's a war there for me, isn't there?
you're responsible for the client.
yeah, but...
didn't you use little information from the inside when you defend him?
no, but i...
why wouldn't i?
just for the client.
my case is very small.
i need something.
larry's weak point is ritual.
he's talking to me too fast because he knows i can't understand what's coming to me.
okay.
he's vulnerable when he loses his ritual.
okay.
you're on "your lives" with cindy margis.
michelle mail email e-mailed me and asked me a way in hollywood.
we met in hollywood and...
do it!
i'm not using myself.
we can't deny more passion between us.
you want me, i want you.
let's be honest.
you do my knee and i'll have my hair handed.
you're breaking my spine.
don't you like denial?
then let's be honest.
go!
i went to l.a., and i didn't even think of you.
your mind is in jackson.
people blame me.
but when it comes to business, i understand human behavior.
in the last month, you shaved your legs in the morning.
is that your scientific deal?
if a woman is shaving her legs in the morning, then it's over.
unstable.
go to jackson.
he's the man you're crazy about.
first, to clone people, to clone people, to order society...
the court hasn't been brought before.
when people are against put clones...
that's not the court's business.
you won't let me second...
"the second" is a sexual term.
i completely object.
i wish i could just get back to the sheep.
these crusts have no place in court.
let's get to the car first.
a moment ago?
let's hear what mr. paul said.
second, forgive my nightmare...
he's kidding.
... even if the clone can clone, it's not mr. stoller.
too much.
i'm guessing in the law cases, but i've been caught for too much.
he's fucked me three times.
i'd like to apologize, i'd like to say noter.
four!
is that possible to clone?
first, i want to listen to your client and find out why.
your honor, i hope...
see you tomorrow.
see you.
ling denies even what he wants.
what do you feel?
he can have it.
a man's deep, an ink bottle.
i mean, i hope ling's drowning.
are you really okay?
yeah.
actually, john cage was his lawyer.
did you know?
how'd it go?
smile's against the princesses.
what's going on?
don't ask me.
john wanted a few clues he could use against you in court, so i told him to break your ritual.
you're useless without my ritual.
cute, but useless.
you gave him advice?
her client is like mine.
we sleep with you.
you're going behind my back.
you giving him advice when you can't beat me?
does john know you can never beat me?
excuse me?
does john know you never beat me?
no, no.
never?
isn't that nice?
so cute.
someday i'll beat you, but john will beat you with my advice today.
great.
i'm gonna lose my shit.
no, you won't.
now he knows i'm trying to break the ritual.
he said you'd never beat him.
not just in this case, not in any case.
did she?
yeah.
i bet, john.
did he say i could never beat him?
yeah.
never?
never.
sure.
i can date a man in paris.
you can go as far away from here as you like.
i'm not gonna get you into this.
no.
how was i?
larry?
why are you here?
i thought john and i would walk together.
you try to get me confused, i won't let you.
i saw you smile.
it wasn't supportive.
is everything all right, john?
you look a little disturbed.
he's working on the tough but he won't cut me off.
good.
want to go out for dinner?
i'd love to.
i'm full today, but how about tomorrow?
great.
we always talked about having kids.
i think i want cindy and i want to do our dream.
but you're not talking about having cindy's kid.
you want to clone him.
the only way to keep her genetic miracle is to clone.
sitting up there, including mr. paul, including the gayricidoo, a lot of people...
your honor, i'd like to stand up as a gay readings.
mr. paul, sit down.
mr. cage, don't testify.
a lot of people find the idea of cloning.
but i'm not a scientist trying to make their living species perfect.
and i know i can't bring cindy back.
i want to make it last.
and i guess i don't want him to end his last name.
thank you.
first, i'm sorry for your loss.
but you're trying to copy cindy, aren't you?
this is the process to create a complete genetic copy of your dead wife.
look, his talking is the same...
cindy, did she ever talk about the fruit that was played with her genetics?
it was against it.
what about chicken with the genetics?
it was against it.
but he made it clear he had the idea that his own copy had been played by the genetics.
it's not the same!
it's not all about chickens, mr. lawyer.
i didn't say that.
i'm nervous enough without you.
you wouldn't let anyone get your number.
whatever makes you great, you have to regain it.
maybe melanie scared him out.
john, i'm sorry, man.
but remember, larry, he said he'd never beat him.
never.
you should think big now.
because this time, i won't rub her feet.
whatever happens, you have to find barry white.
yeah.
yeah.
come!
we did it together, baby.
does ally know?
the pressure doesn't help me.
may i?
sure.
just you and me.
bullshit!
how's this cloning?
very impressive.
we're getting eggs from the data data data data we've injected the cigars.
this cindy stoller is a clindy stoller, we get cells.
this part is impressive.
witness said it's impressive before.
is that just the part?
and then we pull each egg core with a needle.
there's a lot of needles in clones.
we're putting the dna-edge eggs next to the data cell.
in that case, cindy's cell.
and we do energy.
what does that mean?
it's a shock, some sort of power...
i'm trying to understand.
you try to kill the bug, and i find it disgusting, even for a public supervisor.
let's keep moving.
you're both falling from my eyes.
what happens to the cells after the energy's been given?
they boil each other when energy is given energy to dna without dna cells.
then we're putting these in the transponder mother and it's a clone-edged baby.
sperm?
no, that's impressive.
is that really possible?
i admit most embryos die.
but it's in the way one is successful.
we've already tried that on the sheep.
it's possible for people.
how far away is this technology?
it's for now.
people don't expect science.
scientists are waiting.
thank you, doctor.
hey, mark.
if you need anything, your assistant, call mine.
i don't see you shoot anymore, two-faced jackal.
i see it.
maybe another time.
what's going on?
i'll tell you about dinner sometime.
forget it.
what's wrong with you?
what's the matter?
i threw myself in front of you.
i threw it like a bullet.
you know what this is big for me?
i made you a gesture.
i told you i was in love with you last week.
anyone can share such a stupid feeling.
please.
i want something very small.
closing conversations, you must be with me.
together, we can defeat larry.
just you and me.
come!
you've come to the end of your career.
what else are you doing?
are you here?
there you are!
that's why i start bread in the day.
he was here.
who?
barry white came.
forgive me for not guessing that.
i'm a manantation.
not like before.
i can't bring it back while there's other people in the room.
most people can't dance in front of other people's imaginary camels.
i always brought her.
i walked with her in the crowds.
no, that's what you have to do.
call him in the shelter, alone.
first take him out, take him out, then go out there between people.
i don't know if i can.
you have to.
without barry, what are you?
look at this.
you can't spend your life like this.
you have no choice but to find barry.
they'll take his person, his dna.
your brother liked your brother very much.
excuse me, i'll make my objections like this.
he's not bringing cindy back.
even the only egg twins they say they share the same dna, different people.
even as they get someone's organs, he needs his permission.
the dna's copy is a much more vulnerable attitude.
in their private.
i'm sorry.
mine?
i didn't mean to step on it.
it was wrong.
don't you want to see your brother's genes continue?
he'll look like her, he'll talk like her.
wouldn't he want that?
he's been against genetic research all along.
she wouldn't want that.
never.
you have your computer.
i want some privacy.
from brazilla.
it'll be our first chat.
i feel good about her.
but keep your hand quick.
i'm the one who's gonna rub his stinking feet.
did you find barry white?
any signs?
never mind!
couldn't you find your own office?
yours is closer to court and my feet hurt a little.
i have no idea.
elaine!
he's been watching each other.
would you stop watching me?
you think that's what i'm doing?
i didn't ignore you.
i thought you weren't interested.
you were right.
'get it, deja vu's.
you've been angry since i came to this firm.
i'm angry because you lied to me.
i'm angry because i slept with you.
it's hard to go around all the time in the middle.
it's hard to be amigo.
i don't know why you do it every day.
obviously, from the beginning, we're both a little embarrassed.
then why don't we make a new start?
you may be right.
you might not.
jackson.
how are you?
no complaint.
it's definitely ours, isn't it?
something's up.
yes, it is.
nobody, just you and me.
funny little man, right?
it's okay with me.
right on time.
it's like being dr. frankenstein.
the idea to start packing organs?
choose dna?
these are horrible.
we could have a hokey team full of wayne grezky copys.
they can unite mike tyson with a pitbull.
the odds.
terror.
but the truth is, every time science comes a new step, people are worried about the future of humanity.
we made a lot of snakes, your honor.
we're playing genes.
this technology will save lives.
are there any risks against being asked?
sure, there is.
my client knows his wife's wishes and dreams.
dreams they had together.
this will give you the chance to keep the family miracle they hoped for.
we have to be open to science to make a couple of children.
it can't be who owns his dna, can it?
i remind mr. paul... that the wife in life may not have his dead wife's organs, or his dead wife.
mr. paul, i'm just saying that there's something wrong with mrs. stoller's wishes.
but there's no reason for us to believe that.
you're not sure when you can talk.
now it's your turn.
i may not have a legal reason.
but i have a compass.
that's what it's about.
then why are you standing there?
he can clone his mother.
his grandfather.
one day, kids can play with their grandmother's twins in the sand pool with their grandmother's twins.
famous people can start selling their dna.
imagine you're a parent to barry white's twins.
when it's taken place of the technology to take over my universe, it's gonna be a line of line?
once, we were afraid of heart transplants.
the tube baby idea was considered anomaly.
now he accepts the truth and society.
they have steps to clone organs, save lives, destroy the disease.
these may be real.
but to clone a human being to clone a dna clone and make it look like a medical exam?
you can split up.
i'm sorry.
i appreciate your effort.
i don't want a rematch.
hi.
hi.
you come here often?
that's my entrance sentence.
it's a horrible entrance sentence.
has it worked before?
better.
you want to go to the bar?
not tonight.
because you beat larry?
not that.
truth be told, i didn't want to win this time.
no, i want to be alone tonight.
alone with him.
not at all.
like you said, most people don't dance with a imaginary disco.
you're not crazy.
truth is, i'm a little jealous.
when you're disappointed in the real world, you create something.
hey.
maybe the three of us could walk.
give me a chance.
if he doesn't come, i still have me.
well, i'll do that.
let's go.
who knew the karaoke night was gonna be the most pleasant party on the bullshit show?
you said p.iddy and kissinger?
let's just say, "islands in the statam" never said that.
the limo driver called and said...
embarrassing the wedding of the multilion donald treump?
sam, i've been in vegas for 00 minutes, but i haven't played a hand yet.
your favorite table is ready.
ladies love a good karaoke singer, danny.
call me.
you think you can get any girl you want?
get her.
it's alone, man.
he's here for the "the new virgin born".
technically, girls without a virgin can change pure.
the card numbers have shot this month, and the last matter report says they're missing in the bivjack table.
there's a card numbers down there.
ed thinks there might be a card score.
maybe we'll keep this conversation later, like drinking.
patty, it's been three and you've been here a week.
i didn't pay my rent and the reason for letting me stay your land host...
listen, i'm sorry, but this is a business.
if we pay for every shirt you sink, i'll sink.
okay, the gift boxes are packed and waiting to go to the guests' rooms.
our flowers brought the orchidos and the rest of the 0,000 will come tomorrow.
however, if it doesn't come for any reason, a ship from amsterdam to the tulips...
mary, don't worry.
i'm sure it'll be all right.
you're the most comfortable person i've ever seen.
thanks for coming, galina.
that's a hundred thousand clothes.
a hundred thousand dollars?
like i said, first for me.
it's a lot more than what we lost.
it's not about playing with a certain duck.
numbers sit on a table, and if there are rich people, they'll play, right?
suspect lady, red hair, yellow dress, heading west.
thank you.
mr. sperreos, i'm from security.
the question i always ask.
we haven't been married yet and you've been out all night.
no offense.
honey, i'm winning here.
this night's over and so is yours.
all right.
i told donald trump that our wedding has to be like some delicious chicken based on our palmach party.
my team has been trying to make your wedding for months to make the biggest and most elegant wedding in this city.
come on.
he was always like a boss when he was a secretary.
why are you so desperate?
that's all i care about, when you stop playing the commission, montecito's still in front of it.
let's go, people.
the tie man told us he told us he had a dozen tips down the air conditioner's cold.
he could mark the 00's killers and make sure the game is rich.
he sits all night sitting in that slot machine, he's rare.
and he doesn't separate his eyes from nakedjacks.
sperreos likes to get up and won the game a minute ago without playing a game.
you can't prove it.
even if i count the cards, it's not illegal.
that's technically correct.
but we have a different sense of justice in vegas.
like it used to be, i could catch a cheat and destroy it in the desert.
i'll be honest with you, i'm an old-fashioned man.
please.
now that we have your picture, you're black book.
i'll arrest you personally if you take your step inside of montecito.
did you hear?
hey, jack!
he let us down for 000,000.
as long as your count isn't a machine without an outlaw, you know that it wasn't illegal, and she didn't have
at least we can have some fun with him.
not your story.
if somebody's financial and teach them things, nothing's over.
i'm mike, from mysique last night.
he's the guy with no phoenix.
actually, there are other cities you're not.
moines, for example.
it's amazing, but i have to go.
i'm destructive, aren't i?
you said something i finally joined.
i think you should have the problem because i'm usually attractive.
then, what?
maybe because you're so beautiful, i get a little tired around you.
i have a wish.
you know what we're gonna do?
what?
we're gonna sit together and try to figure out why you're not drinking drinking.
patty.
almost there.
did they say i'm okay?
it doesn't matter if you're okay.
i should fire you.
please.
thank you, thank you, thank you.
the tailor told me you sent her back this morning, but there's no record of her being there.
our 000 friends are coming to this wedding tomorrow, state president, industry leader, opah.
would you like to tell opah that the wedding was canceled and came to las vegas for nothing?
if we don't find it, montecito would be happy to take the same.
that dress was a fashion witness.
he sewed a dozen french tailors with his hands.
he doesn't have another one like him.
you know how much that dress cost me?
that's a big problem, sam?
wait.
hey, danny, you asked me to check out the big blackjack winner.
montecito's already eaten, flowers, and millions for fun.
...if the wedding doesn't come as planned, and lipworth refuses to give it.
you think someone actually stole?
what's the value in that thing?
why not the tailor galina?
he took care of the price of the dress.
mike.
hey.
let me know how you're going.
are those the same techs that sperreos and your team use?
we're burning a team, sending somebody else in a couple of hours.
if we don't find this behind your back, we might have to give them the key to the safe.
you'd better be right away, you bastard.
are you talking to sperreos?
you'd better get your hands off because the president's attack me is more than the reason i won blackjack from the montecito.
that was good.
did i take the dress?
i just want to know what happened.
i make changes, and i give the dress to the montecito news.
is there a camera in the shop?
i saw real diamonds on a costume for elton john.
compared to that, this dress is nothing.
galina protects herself.
you're free to go.
i help, patty.
god knows why i agreed to this project?
i've always helped a baby bird, even if it was rabies.
then let me get my tray.
this is christina, our best waiter.
knees bending, back trouble.
more important than anything, trust.
trust.
his tray is full of martinis with weight.
it's the heavyest drink to move.
he doesn't even look at the glasses.
he believes he's capable of right and here he is.
nigger team.
you're not a nigger.
breathe with me, patty.
be like a bose, patty.
you want me to sit here until mysque is open?
thank god i don't want you to stand here like a karate kid.
you too.
vic, this morning, you sent one of your guys to the store to buy clothes.
yeah.
do you remember who you sent?
tailor gave me a recording, but i couldn't remember the face.
bart, you went to the store this morning to pick up a dress.
no, i didn't go.
why?
joey stopped me when she was about to leave and wanted to leave.
scan joey's face and get your address for me.
thank you.
i'm sorry.
the country sea air.
why would you make her pee?
did you hear from the dress?
yeah, candy.
who's candy?
it's not me because i know you're forbidden here, but others do.
do you know where we can find it?
danny mccoy, montecito surveillance and security.
how do you know nick sperreos?
cops don't scare me.
okay, wait, wait.
fine, fine.
that's enough.
okay, i know him.
he came here a couple times with his friends.
these are friends?
you know these?
yeah, i guess so.
nick is a good boy.
one of them asked me to break the fangs.
i think he thought i wouldn't be suspicious.
stripters are always rewarded with a flute.
look, it was good for five minutes and i didn't have to take my clothes off.
why are you so interested?
'cause sperreos and his friends are involved in some kind of card operation.
i thought they were just some rich kids.
someone's behind this, and i need to find out who.
do you have any idea who's trained and who's financial?
one time they came with a big one of them.
yeah, they called him bucky.
mitch, did you scan joey's face?
move forward.
somebody's paying her.
can you expand the picture?
no, but i can bring another explanation.
so lipworth's fiancee lissy?
we need to talk.
but you already know, don't you?
i know you're paying to get rid of the mission dress.
why?
this wedding, details, fair, cost...
listen.
it's kind of weird if you want to leave.
that's the point.
i don't know if i want to leave.
i love her but life...
i mean, how many of the 000 are my friends?
people say it's a sinella story.
i'm not cinderella.
i'm just a normal new jersey girl.
i may not know much, but considering my wedding's worth 00 times more than my parents' house...
that's not true.
it is.
jared and i are so different.
i mean, what harm would it do?
how old do you think these kids are?
00, no bigger than 00.
danny, the years you wanted.
we'll see.
they're all 00 years old, and they all have math skills to count cards.
then they must have been taken from the math department and trained children.
then i remember, how can i bring them to the knee?
i started the local college, considering how the second team got here right away.
because you're a great man and i have something to do with what's less attractive.
maybe change time.
listen, mike, there's something i need to say before i go this far.
and i came to vegas to say, "your family's virginity kick."
regen.
i made mistakes with men in my past, and i wanted to open a clean page, and i swore until i got married.
i mean, it doesn't make him worth less than my gift before.
it's nice to get married.
good.
what?
you want to go to school again?
i'd like to go back and do it back and go back to the rain forest and check out the indian people.
you're an idiot.
what's up, ruben?
you touch me, i'll call my lawyer right away.
are you gonna call your lawyer?
what do you want?
where's bucky?
i don't know what you're talking about.
we have records of her robbing the montecito.
i don't think the students here like that sort of thing.
i can call the dean and get your ass out of here.
please don't tell my parents.
hey.
hey.
did you hear something called a virgin reborn?
so you always knew that?
i'm sorry, but i could get every girl i wanted to get her, she'd become ridiculous.
yeah, i set a trap, so sweet and beautiful.
you were going to let her not sleep with you.
hey, where are you going?
hey, mike.
i won't need you.
hey.
i was a total idiot.
it took a while to get through this whole process.
you think there's a place in your heart that can give me a second chance?
is that the room service to the cream castle, baby?
excuse me.
what was the precious gift events?
because to me, the christmas after year, it's just hair around the paperwork.
look, i was reborn five or six times.
then why isn't it me?
i tried to change.
so this is my fault?
i'm really sorry.
i've heard your advice.
i talked to jared and told her everything.
cancel.
cancel wedding, not marriage.
bucky's training his team here?
hey, ruben, if it's funny, get your family on the phone.
bucky.
mr buckner?
you know him?
my high school math teacher.
i'm the head of security at montecito.
yeah.
you remember mrs buckner?
last year, coach ran off with kajoyan.
nafaka is killing me.
debt from night school.
but it's tax evals.
you guys have won a lot of casino money.
i'm guessing that part of that money wasn't reported to the tax company.
keep these card numbers away from montecito, and we'll forget about what happened.
before these kids get out, danny's gonna get their pictures and information.
what's the name of the left food?
oh, my god.
did you miss the flowers, the towel and opah?
you know i don't care about those things.
the only thing that matters is spending the rest of my skateboard with you.
delinda, i'm sorry.
he needs to listen to you, honey.
i'll make you a star.
i hope you made a note.
careful, we're about to enter.
do i know you?
vinny's hanging out with your mom.
you really want to risk your life for an missing skirt and moruk?
any sign of professor?
i know six wish, why...
stestein's gonna kill sara in the library.
he's speeding through the sword of stestein's sword and bringing the gold of his ship.
since when do you call her jax?
unfortunately, it doesn't take long.
what did you do to stestein?
capone's men are taking the ship.
you're here because i killed jsa's stupid leader.
mr. rex tyler, right?
i don't want to spend the whole night here.
nothing, you drunken maniacs.
my business is better.
i'm the authority of the entire you.
every night, 00,000 people come here to have fun, and i make sure they have fun.
are you an actor?
yeah.
okay.
tell hastteen i'm the boss here.
don't say that.
anything she wants, just say it.
have you seen a hot market manager around here?
where are you, man?
i have a meeting after the play.
how much time do we have?
five, 00 seconds.
i can do a lot of things in 00 seconds.
you're a funny girl.
i'm seeing other people.
i'm seeing other people.
happy birthday, ben.
how do you know?
good morning.
all right.
happy birthday, ben.
you're a doctor, aren't you?
two years ago, you said, "yes."
it's a bit alicist because you don't always ask yes-no answers.
forget i said that for now.
there's gonna be circus here tonight, and if there's ice on the ground, those fire-fangled guys could get lost in front of the kids, and they could fall on their sticks.
understand?
you also told me not to run in the hallway.
forget about what we did two years ago.
oh, no, no, no.
he wants to talk.
that's not good, dude.
erit this ice, bobert.
benjamin!
come here.
quick.
crystal, before you get upset and start chasing everyone else, about this ice...
did you see a little white pill that says spanish stuff on it?
i don't quite understand your concern.
or did i already take that pill?
hello.
yeah, i think you already took the pill.
i hate the circus coming here.
happy?
are they sad?
why are their pockets so big?
i'm sure you're talking about clowns.
good morning, beautiful people.
good morning, alonzo.
you're in an incredibly great mood again.
every day is a beautiful day, my friend.
serious, every day?
ben, that was the best day.
that was the day i started taking care of myself, the day i began to devote myself to the wonderful people of san diego.
what are you doing?
i have to get that pill out of my back.
what about today's help meeting?
i've put big money on the legal himalya dog competition.
one of the dogs said he bit someone with the himalayas.
anyway, i have a nightmare of himalara.
can't we use that money to make this place better?
okay, you own this place, we'll do whatever you say.
did you see the fat paint painting?
don't forget to bring some sort of kids for pictures.
you know, black, white.
bring the kid.
we're gonna need a cup.
i'm going to get a cup of space.
you're right on applause, because they're very good ideas.
benjamin, i almost forgot.
your... your son?
how'd your new assistant get it?
thank you for her.
he set a man on fire?
there was an investigation.
the evidence was found inconvenient.
i mean, yes.
he's good, isn't he?
she set him on fire.
not really.
a-a-al-al...
alono...
what do you think it means to send a message to a girl, "we need to talk"?
i'm in similar things.
i think you'll get a better chance of getting closer.
what better than that?
yeah, i thought so.
happy birthday, little man.
good morning, heather.
good morning.
i'll tell you why i fainted.
ben!
he's got a man in his office, and he's very attractive.
okay.
hi.
hi.
is there anyone else here, someone more attractive than you?
no.
okay.
i'm me.
i'm roman.
so you're crystal's son.
that must be terrible for you.
yeah.
absolutely not fantastic.
i wonder how they swimming in water.
okay.
i like mob movies.
as a talent...
this place is exciting.
political meeting here, sports, rodeo, nights, footballs, motorcycles.
you're not interested in any of this?
remember me?
i gave you three messages, and you never answered.
i think you should've learned that after you slept together for five months, the answering messages left me crazy.
look, i know we hate tied.
i accept the relationship of this exemplary.
but this morning, i woke up in your house alone, which means you snuck out of the house.
i couldn't find my underwear until i got out of my wallet while i was paying for the coffee.
i got another coffee with this coffee, more...
who is this?
i like mob movies.
and you, i really need to talk.
yes, it is, because it's more chance of getting closer.
what better than that?
that's a good opportunity for you.
see you at the christmas party.
i don't think you mean that.
speak spanish.
i speak a little spanish.
yeah, i never understood what you said.
in fact, your english is pretty good.
elephant!!!!!!
crystal.
did you hear what i just said?
i didn't hear.
let me see that talk.
i don't think you should say "yay, black kids!"
well, when should i say?
i don't think you should.
and i wouldn't sing if it was me.
there's still ice.
yeah, i know.
i'm not very sad.
it's your way of life.
you never wanted someone in the house who was emotionally emotionally connected to you, wondering how and where you were, who came in the morning, waiting for you at home.
what's so good about celebrating birthdays?
but you're having big parties on your own birthday.
i need to know i'll never be alone.
i'm not so sure what i should do now.
i'm in, you step on the gas, go.
thank you.
the black, white, the white, the asians, and-- and--
don't sing that song.
i think we should have dinner to celebrate my birthday.
that would be a good vaccine for our relationship.
i think we should be together.
i'm going to finish this relationship.
why did you let me talk first?
you tell me first.
you start with the first one in all our conversations.
we said we saw other people, remember?
alzo?
he's my best friend.
he wanted to live with me for a while.
he wants to get tied.
he wants to get tied up?
a man we're talking about, right?
what a man.
look, i...
alzo is an adult.
other people care.
he asks questions about me and he listens to my answers.
what bothers me is that i thought we were the same.
when you say you're emotionally damaged,...
how did he react when you told him?
he was a very happy man.
that blows him up.
live with me.
we can handle the commitment.
honey, i'm not the right woman for you.
you're such a great person to have fun.
but no one can be right for you because you're only thinking of yourself.
what was that?
i think the sound came through my head.
i can't be a frying master.
i guess.
you know the worst part?
i don't think about anyone but myself.
it's impossible for me to take care of other people.
suddenly, i feel the need to communicate, but i have no idea how to do it.
i'm in trouble, man.
victim kermit, right?
yeah.
what about him?
i think it's great.
go, man.
sunlight.
hi, ben.
hi.
a very attractive man.
sorry.
anyone know how to use a ball?
come on, clowns.
it's almost over.
keep breaking.
good day.
where's the boy?
i especially wanted an i.d. child.
there's an international kid over there.
alzo.
yeah.
yeah.
thank you.
they've stopped.
most people ask why i love children so much.
maybe it's because i never had my own child.
i believe that the happiness of our children, the community we want to live happiness in, and the lives of the people of this community.
they're our most important gay men in the future.
when you want them to do something for you, they do it with pleasure.
or when you're old, i just began to believe that a life you were living for yourself was empty.
i wasn't gonna tell you, but i have to share a little song with you guys i wrote in this special situation.
if we just put the musical part aside, it was really touching.
sometimes it's really fun to work with you.
i'm so happy now.
on three, everyone say, "thank you, crystal cohen."
two...
oh, my god!
ax clowns!
ax clowns!
ax clowns!
ax clowns!
ax clowns!
what a great moment.
i noticed you're leaving a little early.
hi.
are you okay?
i'm a little scared.
sure.
it's normal that you think you chose the right man.
i'm 000% sure i chose the right man.
all right.
what a great moment.
i've never done this before.
what if i'm not ready?
what if she's just acting like she wants me?
after you have me, what if she doesn't want me anymore?
of course she wants you.
you have everything.
everything.
okay?
okay.
okay.
actually, we could make love one last time.
hey, crystal.
i want to make love to her.
i'll see what i can do.
will you pay attention to the poor kid you threw in the air?
luckily, i convinced them to run this picture.
more than you kick a cop.
underestimate the mayor's ship.
great.
great.
while i catch you,...
i want you to sit down and talk to someone who's cheerful and faithful and loyal to us here, in the middle of the daylight, with an incredible human being.
get in the car.
get in the car.
i'm sure you have a lot to talk about.
great.
happy birthday, ben.
thank you.
look.
what's your name?
dan.
thank you, dan.
i forgot.
have you seen alice?
in his office.
it was business.
i...
i know what you mean.
what do you do in a situation like this?
i think i'm gonna run like my life depends on it.
yeah, that's what i'm gonna do.
they built security cameras directly to paddy.
melt in your mouth.
it rebels everything you say.
this is bullshit, man.
these guys were finally living with me, and they realized that they were so cool and funny.
dee, you're undercover, okay?
dee, we're bringing you to this mission instead of charlie's, but what about the arrogance and question?
maybe we can get to the private office upstairs.
do i have to know the guy when i spaghetti on your face?
and i'm buying to the man i don't know behind my back.
i told you why.
'cause i think you've been pretty long last time.
i couldn't sit down because charlie was left halfway through lunch with the fucking emergency lunch.
i don't want to hit something that you're up against.
as i told that a few minutes ago, our fish have spit out the fish today.
instead, let's all get some plates of hot pipe spaghetti.
extra sauce.
i've always wanted to see this.
i mean, you know, you know, you know, you're a baseball player, you know, even protesting kids
god bless the cream pie and protect america.
look, i'm a very good workman with a long history of countries.
imagine my hate cream pie with your low-priced work force.
the factory was shut down for a couple of days because of the accidents i spent on top.
actually, we're going to love the factory of the chinese.
i don't think you need to worry about it in good shape.
just old porno information.
everyone on tucker train.
well, it's not exactly what it looks like.
no, no.
these are the things my kids care about when they were little.
besides, you know you can't sell these disgusting stuff in the garage.
these boxes show how our lives are perfect.
like they always give you fake id?
the pictures i made in the main school and thanksgiving turkey?
i'm sorry, honey.
i put the finger here, because i have feelings that something's changed here.
danny's not the only one who's wearing jersey uniform and shoots a stick.
in the basement, they were next to the christmas lights and i realized mrs bart had lost her shiv.
i just didn't see you had a plan to win.
yeah, you gave us free beer and then you said, "give me the vote."
we're pretty lucky everyone was taken back.
i'm really not doing anything about sports anymore.
god, it just feels like another life.
i have to hit something with a stick for beer.
okay, brawler's, i want toast before the game.
maybe we'll remember that winning everything isn't everything, but we have a keg!
wait.
everyone, this is riley and my daughter, emma.
i mean, wheeler's in front of a 0-0 with unscathed pregnancy.
tuck, why don't you give something to the new comers?
ben!
that's something i know.
are you going out with mom?
i was gonna talk to myself, but bonnie said she'd handle it.
i did, but i didn't tell him.
you can't say you're welcome.
i mean, when your mom and coach are on date, they can have a pillow talk in bed.
if i call back the girl you made happy hours ago, we'd be glad you had your voice cut off.
we may have more babies.
i'm going to practice until my brain is over.
he's defending his food partner, i think he's doing it pretty.
her father's daughter.
mom's coming soon, will you get the equipment downstairs to the field for me?
this is a lot more than i had before.
you don't care about the shelves, do you?
sounds like i missed the play.
you missed another little thing.
hey, the guys decided riley was the captain.
i was saying it was definitely lost.
i was feeding my baby and you took my team away.
i was wearing your gloves... and then everyone started screaming.
"you're incredible!"
because i hear it's incredible.
maybe you'll do something i haven't done in a long time if you'd come to my place.
because i don't care what others say.
"take your face, stupid fools." i'm so excited!
we just ate some italian food.
that's why i'm trying to stop you.
honey, i think we shouldn't talk about these parts, it's about my private life.
okay, honey, i know you don't want to hear this, but i have a woman and i need them.
i won't even open my mouth.
he said, "to wear the shield."
i don't want someone to cancel their plans.
thank you, danny.
not yet, but it will solve.
honey, are you okay?
i tried to come back as soon as i could.
my hair and that, 00 minutes away.
i haven't called anyone who can take care of emma.
the dentist said i should see you right now.
and remember, don't bring a giant toothbrush.
for the bathroom key.
i'm sorry about your date with hank.
i don't even have to talk to you right now.
please tell me emma's out in the car park.
i don't know if hank canceled something or canceled anything.
but if my mom asks, they hid me here.
you care about other people's happiness.
to make sure she doesn't see and don't understand.
man, you got to get back.
you think he stopped being rigor?
will my head make the small planets whisper?
will you look here?
the minister went home.
if hank doesn't have a job, he's like another guy.
do you have men down here?
mom, i'm home.
what are you doing here?
i'm sure it's my robe.
hank, are you ready for round two?
danny, there's nothing here.
you're unbelievable.
yeah, he hates it.
because we don't watch the same game here.
it's actually full of vodka.
we're gonna drink this and throw it away.
we have a chance to make a clean shot.
sit down next to the other ladies.
what about riley?
okay, tuck, your turn.
shoot again, don't go outside and don't go out.
when i told riley something i should never have heard before, he ate my cake.
i still can't forget you ate your coffee.
don't worry, i'll watch your back, okay?
hey, my teammates.
don't you think it looks sweet today?
is that my phone?
something about the play.
thank god.
i was worried i wouldn't bring you back.
i know what you're thinking, but you have to do something other than control team.
like i did now?
i want you to be more serious in the games.
i'm having a lot harder time putting you on the other guys.
truth be told, i should kick you out of the team.
but i can't.
i'll really miss you when i don't move you.
thank you.
what did you want to tell me?
just...
" we hung out, riley's gone.
" ben's firing her right now."
what?
that's the bad version of what i told you.
coach, can i talk to you?
i think you want your robe back.
not...
mom told me what happened.
i'm really sorry about that hill.
next time i'll tell you i'll be better.
i don't think next.
don't blame him for being a punk.
so you're keeping a funny woman out of your league?
no, that's my mom you're talking about.
and someone who comes out with her is very lucky.
i'll go out with her.
it's safe if you take her down.
what's wrong with me?
maybe you're just so smart and so beautiful.
winning is fun for you.
oh, my god, i like this!
but what does that make me?
the room is full of cups and no one has to share it with me?
danny seems to have solved this.
yeah, none of us are gonna be like your brother.
yeah, i think i've heard that one or two or a thousand times.
right.
right.
i've been thinking about a real change for winning.
i've never tried it before.
yeah, i think you should figure out how to get the real brawler out without me.
nobody wants me.
go brawler!
all lightning, my dear assistant captain.
if it weren't for riley ref.
she would really need a new glass.
no, i can't hide anymore.
honey, you have to help me.
the fear in their eyes caused them to close.
get lost.
don't worry.
i'll find a man who can make you happy.
okay.
looks like she's going to be better.
i know when i see my son.
as i always say, thank you for giving me god.
do wheeler, make wheeler...
what's riley doing?
they call it wheeler.
we're going to use you to watch the case.
why is patty interested in this murder?
i'm suggesting he doesn't answer another question to mr. purcell.
you were alone with your wife's body.
there's no sign of a break-in.
patty, i saw the man who did this.
our company was about to do a tokikovi research on a chemical device.
they're worth billions of billion dollars.
michael, this is daniel purcell.
we have a protection problem.
the lead counselor of the third world's greatest energy generator.
did you tell anyone about us?
the acid rains from the charcoal power planting the bullets into the average of 00 times the country.
they tried to sue a clean case.
so, in the last three years, they have more than 000 cases in their rights?
why didn't he bribe?
i wonder the same thing, but i don't know how patty knows we set up tom.
what did you find out about purcell?
we have to make sure our secrets are still out of order so we can move forward.
it's okay with me.
ellen, i know it's disappointing, but you have to back off.
we all get back.
it might help me.
i have no experience in criminal law.
we must have chased her before she could find time to steal something.
it was dark the first time.
you know, last night, i was wondering if somebody stirred houses.
isn't it your job to find this, detective?
let's see if there's anything in the pictures that'll revive your memory.
mr. purell didn't come here to harass him.
he always used to.
this is a very important progress, mr. purcell.
you find the ring, you find my wife's killer.
mr. purcell, i believe you.
because whoever killed christine is still out there somewhere and you're absolutely no use to it.
you can't use them against me.
don't answer that.
i swear to god that you'd like to be arrested.
one thing three years ago is not possible.
no, but it's like he's lying about everything.
i mean, she's been in her house twice and there's nothing stolen.
isn't the tenant harmful to health?
we spoke on the phone several times, but i don't think he's accepting it.
he wants to introduce me to the man he's with.
if there's anything we need to know, patty will tell us when she feels ready.
whatever you infect every company, it better not come out of stolen papers.
if you're wondering what happened to christine purcell, look deeply.
my only job is to protect mr. kendrick and if you've done something to protect her and you've always been doing something to expend her or to the utima national ahead...
is everything ok in new york?
danielcell, i'm going to see patty hewes.
do you have any reason to believe that this is the finger of the murder of ntima nationalison's wife?
i've watched many farm animals die these secrets.
00 years ago, daniel used daniel purcell as a witness, and he won a case.
then why would the demon global's report suggest that 000 u.s. is acceptable?
danielcell was a brilliant man, but when she came face to face with patty.
no, it's just another big conspiracy to show up for you.
as soon as i tell you what i know about the nationima national, you put me aside.
whatever she tells you, you can't trust her.
i don't know who killed your wife, but you'll be blamed for it.
and they worked together before that purcell demon global.
nine months later, michael was born nine months after the excell's statement.
just the two.
we're going to face unexpected.
we will disable them with a major assault.
on three.
one, two, three.
shoot them!
detective stark?
excuse me.
yeah.
that guy over there.
and did you put him on the 00th road?
am i?
i'd appreciate it if you'd stop asking that.
was mr. young the one you pulled to the 00th road?
i can't tell if you don't say it again.
what? what?????
do you know what this is, you son of a bitch?
it wasn't a real bomb.
no shield, no crime."
not legal, detective.
even the threat with a bomb is a certain physical danger.
i'm terrible.
i think the horrible thing is your shirt.
your honor, we demand the reddine of the case.
liz, i don't know what to say.
he's your partner, jack.
that's not enough reason, jack.
we've been trying to catch wayne young for years.
liz, i...
jack, what are you going to say?
i need to be alone.
you want chips?
no, i don't want chips, dan.
i think they put spice in it.
makes me feel better.
you ruined the case, dan...
but state case.
you mean your ex's case?
they're finished investigating.
that doesn't mean it's department anymore.
department?
and you'd fight crime with sticks?
we need a financial source for research.
you know what?
good luck to you.
you'll see.
good day to you all.
see you in hell.
here it is.
i thought you might remember that.
you're absolutely right.
hey, you got any nikotin gum?
i can't think without them.
because i left those cancer sticks.
that's it.
okay, we've got to do a couple of footwork.
first, i need to get myself a pumpkin.
you got it wrong!
there's something wrong!
please!
i made a deal while you were in jail.
both of us.
what kind of deal?
heroin.
near south america.
i put it in one of our trucks.
i have a client.
and this is just the beginning.
if it works, we'll get more heroin.
wayne, we're so close!
you meet the guy and we deliver.
what about the cops?
they can't come after you cross the border!
cops can't do anything!
rough day?
yeah.
is it girl or business?
you're gonna need a second doughnut.
hey, dan.
what's up?
of course.
i'll talk to liz this morning.
i'll call you later.
freeze!
okay.
okay.
freeze!
i'm not moving!
why are you assaulting me?
you're hurting the sacred commitment.
i've got three warrants on me.
it's not the first thing to make contact with the cops.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
how would you feel if the arrest warrant was taken off?
"don't be smart."
"julius, you don't have to go to jail, do you? "?
because it seems to me.
i'm all yours, man.
you can do what you want.
i want information about wayne young.
i know that.
i know wayne young.
any way?
all i want is a piece of paper, pen, and writing...
do it.
there's a place from oakwood, okay?
that's it.
does that make us good?
we'll put him in jail...
we're good.
okay.
because i want to embrace you.
you can hug.
all right.
thank you very much, man.
okay.
okay.
what can i do for you, jack?
i was talking to dan...
it means everything's in the book...
not really your partner.
actually, that's why i can send her home.
don't worry about it.
just give me information to fight wayne.
okay.
i'll see you at the office at 0:00.
wayne worked in a garage in east dalarta.
he works for a company like shell.
but what do we arrest him for?
we'll think of something when we get there.
no, dan.
we'll do an research.
yeah, that works.
by the way...
how did you know where wayne was doing business?
am i still?
this is the address.
hello!
it's weird.
what did you say about getting in and looking at the truck?
what about this?
we're not going to be back without permission?
they should know the safety's a mess.
besides, nobody gets in here without a helmet.
you mean us?
hey, ours is breach.
after spending more than $0.00.
so warn me.
it's like a law woman...
it pisses you off, but it doesn't do anything to calm you down.
things get worse.
what is this place?
what are they doing here?
we don't know...
i have to call liz.
just...
dan, what are you doing?
dan, we can't be here.
what's illegal, dan?
okay?
this truck is full of boxes.
yeah.
crime boxes.
come on.
we're over 0 feet.
i can feel the leak in my back!
another excuse for the report.
listen, dan.
we had a bad start here, okay?
did you hear something?
start the car.
i'll turn it off.
dan, this is an illegal investigation, okay?
if we get caught, we're in big trouble!
your phone's ringing.
god!
i hate it.
hello.
hello, detective dan.
i'm julius, man.
how's our parole agreement going?
hey, i can't talk now.
i'm behind wayne young's truck.
long story.
a big armed man...
caesar's right, caesar.
looks like things are going well.
you're glad you didn't blow my head with a pump?
it was just a little misunderstanding, wasn't it?
yeah.
make some money.
yeah, me too.
fuck!
what is that?
thanks for coming.
i'm dying slowly.
you look good.
i'm not good.
you know about my parole.
the police i made the deal was trapped in one of wayne young's trucks.
there's no truck in there!
i mean, i have a boyfriend in jamaica.
maybe we'll come back here and open a motel.
but why am i here?
you'll introduce me to wayne young.
you two friends, she...
that's a very deep word.
we're more like colleagues, man.
sometimes she asked me to take her to the north, that's all.
skeeter, my dear...
you need to find this truck, and you need to find it now, man.
look, i'll give you $000.
this man, man!
he cut off a man's thumb in time!
the same fingers were lost!
that's disgusting, dude!
i love this car.
including the sound system?
and jants?
you can take them.
you can take your ashtray, skeeter.
just find the truck for me, okay?
all right, i'll help you find the truck.
i didn't mean to yell at you.
there's the aspirin.
they're not gonna review the whole lottery.
what was that?
panic.
dan, this is texas, okay?
you just describe a 00,000-mile area.
damn!
then let's break that door so we can jump out.
what's wrong?
physic, dan.
it's suicide.
not if you jump fast enough, man.
we'll take the speed of the truck down to zero.
come on.
why are you acting like something bad?
we found wayne young exactly where we wanted him.
yeah.
it's on the road to two stripes in a countryside.
yeah.
i'm detective jack bailey.
please leave a message, i'll call you back.
well, it's been 00 minutes.
congratulations.
you're officially going the same way with your partner.
are you still waiting for your girlfriend?
detective bailey is not my girlfriend.
jack.
wherever you are, i hope you're having fun.
all i know is they're somewhere south.
how are you?
thank you.
man, what took you so long?
dude, you asked me to find a criminal, didn't you?
can we just focus, please?
where's the truck in the police?
that way.
so i'm just gonna go this way?
what happens on that road?
i'm working on the rope.
man you...
i think he had a deal with a man.
dude, you're gonna kill me.
you're definitely gonna kill me.
you know anything else?
i heard it was a scary look.
and he's not from this country.
we can make the deal thursday.
i'm not british.
south africa.
yeah, south africa has a zurich head.
i'll see you thursday.
that's it.
coming with you wasn't part of our deal.
hey.
do you want my car or not?
yes, i do.
i thought so.
thank you.
good night.
you have interesting friends, man.
the guy was wearing weird boots, man.
i got those boots too!
yeah.
what else was i supposed to do?
we're partners, right?
you would have done the same for me.
any other deals?
anything i should know?
that's it.
dan, what are you doing?
good luck.
i'll take care of it.
what are you doing?
don't i look like someone who's trying not to go crazy?
apparently.
i haven't opened it all yet.
you're looking for the stinking?
let me ask you something, dan.
like i said, these boxes are full of crimes.
yeah...
are you thinking of helping?
this situation needs a little more light.
mysterious sunset.
natural.
i like that.
don't die before i get back, dan.
don't die before i get back, dan.
don't die before i get back, dan.
man, would you shut up?
i'm trying to talk on the phone!
yeah.
sort of.
lubbock, "lillian antique store."
i don't know, man.
a place like a souvenir.
also...
god.
i learned some information about the south american man.
perfect.
just focus on the deal.
save the mustache.
save the mustache.
the smell of candles began to drown me.
they smell like mysterious sunset.
i think i'm gonna throw up.
if you vomit, i'll light more candles.
no.
give me that.
at least 0 pounds.
heroin.
this is heroin.
at high.
small fires.
it's probably just the, uh,
wow, you know a lot about heroin.
thank you.
so you're saying you're planning this?
being a cop is a team job.
and you, jack.
that's how we'd end this together.
are you serious?
"take this, sal, then catch it again."
the bad cops can only fire the guilty with weapons on their own hands.
the good cops are in a team, and they're gonna fire guns with guns.
thanks for the career advice.
hey, listen, dan...
what? what?????
the truck's stopping.
why are we so early?
what kind of problem did you pick a place like this?
this little town is right between the states.
i mean, you're 000 miles from the nearest police.
no neighborhood caught.
we're not even here.
just in case.
hi.
don't worry about the armed men.
mikel likes to carry a heavy weapon so it doesn't know what's gonna happ
i'm not worried.
good to see you.
looks like we're gonna do a little work.
put the pump down.
on your knees.
excuse me?
i said get down on them.
hey, hey, hey, cowboy.
what you do here...
what the hell's going on here?
i'm sorry, wayne.
i made a deal, you son of a bitch!
everyone wins.
absolutely.
what? what?????
okay.
okay.
no mess.
how was the meeting?
they're both unbelievable.
we'd better shoot both of them.
motherfucker.
i should have killed you when i had the chance.
enough!
let's finish this.
bring heroin here and get out.
open the truck.
smell that?
come!
come!
remember, you'll stick to the plan.
just the two.
we're going to face unexpected.
we will disable them with a major assault.
come!
what the hell?

what happened?
detective bailey's alak.
it's usually hot.
i found an address at jack's desk last night...
hey!
we had a deal!
good day.
looks like you're in some trouble.
not as it seems.
i think we're safe for now.
don't say "we're in your step!" again!
let's go!

i don't know and i don't care.
just kill them all and bring me heroin.
protect me.
i'll call the lieutenant and ask for backup.
lieutenant ruiz.
yes, lieutenant!
detective bailey!
you haven't checked in for the last six hours.
where the hell are you?
long story, okay?
detective stark and i need backup.
send as many people to code 0!
"we're now at the antique shop."
lubbock's 00 minutes away.
okay, we're under heavy fire!
that's five hours away, detective.
what the hell are you doing there?
long story.
just as many men as you can send, okay?
we're too late, man.
we're too late.
this fool deal was five minutes ago.
what address?
there must be somewhere around here.
man, come on.
is this it?
yeah.
left behind.
we just passed.
it's not a safe drive!
then you can talk to my driving.
back in 00 minutes.
sounds right.
we need to get the bad guys back on the team.
we're on their way with the cavalry.
good idea, dan.
right in front of you.
look!
if we die, it must be in a real car!
are you ready?
i'm waiting for you to say "let's go."
let's go!
get in the car!
press, press, press, press, press, press.
don't you know how to bitch?
what did they teach you at the academy?
press!!!!!!!
press, press, press, press!
son!
you!
can't you make it go faster?
it had a good engine!
this car is dead!
maybe it would have been better if we had taken sedan.
want some?
dan, when did you get that chocolate?
i came back to the store when you were on the phone.
the almond nuts...
son!
i want that heroin!
i don't think it's very good anymore!
what, you think i didn't notice?
take it!
come on.
come!
hang on.
beautiful!
that's exactly what i wanted it to be.
it's what scared me.
no moving.
i think we're completely safe now.
see what i see?
looks like a hairy truck.
i got it!
down!
get down!
are you okay?
yeah, i'm fine.
but i was just fine.
yeah.
bastard!
i got it!
he's taking heroin and running.
jack.
partner, we have a bigger problem.
put your weapons down.
where's heroin?
you're lying!
he's not lying.
we left her in the middle of the road.
"paco" took him away.
who are you?
what were you doing behind the truck?
we're cops.
are you a cop?
are you kidding?
i'm not.
julius!
you did it!
i'll explain later.
can i embrace you?
yes, you can.
come!
okay.
you'd better get out of here.
get your gun!
what was all this?
we embraced.
i'm a hugger.
it was like there was a number 00.
anyway, he ran right here...
no sign of'o.
what about heroin?
no sign of him.
looks like he took her, too.
you have no witness.
and wayne young will testify against p'o.
and i'm sure that's exactly what you'll say...
"i'll drag him to hell with me."
well, this will do.
yeah, but you know what's not gonna work?
i had no idea i had that.
it just happened.
you came all this way worried about me?
no.
i came all this way to see wayne young's arrest.
i'm so sorry, jack.
well, i stole a sports car and i set the truck on fire.
did you think about that?
we question the south africa man.
did you know the zurichs lived there?
it's a feast.
we stole the pure heroin, okay?
it's hard to accept that as a victory.
"i can't say that we are. "
what do you mean?
don't say "we're in your step!" again!
protect me.
i'll call the lieutenant and ask for backup.
yes, lieutenant!
detective bailey.
long story, okay?
send as many people to code 0!
hey, old man...
sorry about the shootings.
how much is this keeper?
five dollars.
that's brick.
it's her paint.
i'll give you three dollars.
okay.
here.
three dollars.
how much is the chocolate?
00 cents.
why did i do that?
i was hungry.
i'm not saying chocolate.
what made you change packages?
well, you said everything would be okay with the book, right?
yeah.
yeah.
i'm not wasting your time.
i brought you the best one.
this is the best heroin money can buy.
it's 000,000.
top price.
here.
"the aloto memory"?
well, listen.
stop.
wayne young was caught within 00 hours and...
all $0.00.
actually $0.00.
all i have to do...
like i said, being a cop is a team job.
but the big part is like the water desert.
the hunters here spend their lives searching for rare and difficult hunters.
it's the greatest animal that's ever lived with 00 feet long.
in spite of the huge huge big energetic, the blue whales are the greatest of aodinic and energy bills all around your face.
hartca can get more than 000 miles a day.
it takes a lot of effort to open the huge mouth, so when you see it, it's just a rich and heavy razor blade.
there's usually a lot of rare opportunity to feed here.
when it's all over, the hunters have to keep searching for me.
frat birds are pirates of open sea pirates.
the frat birds must be very light because those other sea birds can't have heavy oil that make their feathers waterproof.
small fish try to hide between the dead waves in the ocean of the ocean, the only ones in protection.
the fish from their tailstrapeutic force can take up more than once.
with a good wind, they can float hundreds of feet.
the open ocean hunters can't wander around looking for food.
it's so hard to swim.
this dark ymer has to sleep in the ambush between the fish eats of fish.
in this ocean without a certain specialty, these duckies will see a lot of fish who want to shelter.
it's the first time in weeks.
only with a few inches away from the hunt, she can make a move.
he's hiding in the yosuns, hiding in the perfect camouflage.
the oceans are very enchanting that some of the hunters can only find themselves looking for the hunt in a crew.
dolphins live in a very advanced social group.
they can work together to cover a large field of ocean.
the little group sometimes bring together a thousand, 0,000 superpowers.
they use some sort of "ekolocation" to find their hunt.
but these little fish spend most of their time in the ocean, where the dolphins can't reach.
they only hunt when they go swimming to feed.
when they find a lot of a lot of big dolphins use their sonar for another reason.
as the dolphins feed, they're approaching the bottom of the herd to keep their prey from running deeper deep safe.
as it gets down, the food's on the surface, so the hunters must do everything they can to protect their precious energy.
most of them are dragged by traces of fatal needles full of fatal needles.
others are sending slow to the darkness with the power to push the feathers in the dark.
beroe's the top jelly jelly yunch in deep water.
beroe has special dental planes inside your mouth to catch the jellyatine hunt.
this deep water ink use long enough to hunt, to use long, cluttering tissue.
the ocean may be a wide blue desert, but like every desert, there are wilds.
they force the mountains to face the water of the deep ocean surface into the surface of the ocean's deep ocean memory.
it's up to the sensitive manoeulas to do it here.
hiding in a proper meeting area where he wears a proper sense of trust.
it's hard to imagine how close the lions of a lion's lions are to the perpetrator, so it's hard to imagine how close he is for his hunt.
and the exaggerated crabs that he uses to hide their slow-edged tail moving their slow tails, makes him a lot better.
it's a deep water flow that's made many very calm lives, which also takes visitors to these wild visitors.
they're sending hundreds of miles between the sea mountains they use as a gathering point in the ocean where they don't have a certain special relationship.
both shark type of shark, galapagos and the other traces of the great ocean in the birth of the great ocean, they travel between mountains.
nobody knows exactly why they've packed so many packs, but somebody's definitely looking for food.
if these little fish are close to the lentils, dogs can't reach them.
as long as the silver fish is near the ocean floor, they can defend their predators from their heads.
there's never an easy meal in the ocean.
here, the storm's been exposed to the storm, and the food stays in the surface, it's made up to the looking glass with a stake.
it's the same size as the black-bed albatros fritat, but three times more heavy, so it needs a completely different kind of flight.
albatros, the long- long- long- long winged bird, and this is the kind of bird, and this is the only way to get the wind from the wind.
first, they wipe his energy against the wind, using his energy to make it high.
and then they turn around and take it at the wind, and they win speed.
many times, they spend weeks on sea weeks in the sea without ever coming back to the land looking for hunting.
the wind here is very powerful, albatros can't afford the weight of the oil that makes their feathers waterproof.
they can dive as duck as duck into a meter, so they'll tie their prey to the south sea, which will carry their prey to their range.
like all the birds, albatros have to eggs in the snow, but they're a pretty handful of men in the south ocean.
he's coming here every year to raise half a million albatros puppies.
grown-ups come back to feed their puppies for a couple of days, share their parents' duty.
when the feeding process is over, it's time to get to the sea.
the albatos are so heavy, they can only barter where the wind is strong enough.
from the air, the ocean may look like it's invisible, but under the surface, there's a constant, powerful network of minds.
these minds are more effective than any other power to be identified here by the life out here.
all organs being dragged around the ocean will take these flowing ways.
they come together to feed on their face-fed plants and animals and fresh plankton that the scorpion brings.
their legs slow their clutches, and they keep eating up with a couple of tails up their throats in your head, and they just keep on eating.
these trafficking crabs that carry these trafficking crabs, the iriator of the ocean is also working on the bus.
with the perfect aurerodinots, they can take the longest distance to asgari.
these hunters touch the place between the ocean's minds that often come together.
each pillow has the most extraordinary smell of smells that can perceive certain unpredictable traces of the hunts.
the big fish packs are covered in the charm of the plankton bolt.
a sardine drive could be a mile long.
their self-defense depends on me.
when the attack arrives, sardines act like one body.
each fish fits in the move next to the move of the skin, and it moves all the time in time.
they don't seem to be able to break the sardines' coordinates even when more sea lion arrives.
the lions of lions that big this big of their lions should be able to separate a bunch of less controlable little groupies from the
but there's still a lot of fish in front of the predator.
the sea lions can only do their sardines in the surface and wait for others to join them.
tunnels attack down the tunnels so the sardines will cut their way into deep water.
as the fish squeeze the fish purely squeezes the hunter's business.
a lot of sardines run out in less than an hour.
the rats once again disappear into their own way into the blue.
this blue whale is still searching for food to get to the starvation of its starvation.
he has to find three tonnes of foods in the day that he's so hot because he's so big
it's a crowded razor loaded in the face with fish.
this blue whale finally found what he's been looking for for a long time.
it's a big meal that's worth opening his big mouth.
he's been a hundred feet long, and he's been stuck on the bottom.
the whale's targeting the most dense part of the whale pack is progressing at the hunt.
it's a thief who's lived with a perfectly expanded throat that takes a lot of effort to swim with a pretty big mouth.
while the whales are using their tongue to throw water out the mouth of the whale water, it's saving it in their hair.
but it takes time to wipe out so much water.
the blue whales may not be as much as the other hunters, but they don't have to be.
no other hunters are more eluding than the rich in the messy mountain that the other ocean has been able to quit.
the blue whales are the greatest hunter in the world.
the ocean opens made a lot of trouble for the "av" crew.
it's been a two-year mission to do it.
the team worked together with john calamokidis, the most important blue whale expert in the world.
john got information from these harmless labels.
it's a part of this research, and we're working with the producer's records, and there's a reason why we can't give us any other way to get scientific data.
so what they're doing under water, how they sink, how they face, how they're feeding, why we're doing it because we're doing this research.
the team's success depends on a good six-pack.
so much drunk and whales in the darkness.
we couldn't.
the first year's weakness was impressed and the shot was failed.
the second year's seas are better.
the blue whales go to the surface in a hundred minutes before they dive in 00 minutes.
she's got to try to move the boat forward to the whale, but not right in front of her.
then david's got to go in the water and hope the whale's close enough to get to the rock.
this year's water's unusual this year, but it's still time to keep david in a good position.
after weeks of weeks, finally, all units are together, and david is giving david his life.
it's been heavy before me, so long.
i mean, it was too big, like a burden train.
they're so rare under water under water whales so it's a wonderful success to take a whale's whale.
well, it's a great shot, so, though, though, though, uh, it's been a great shot, but we have to take pictures of the blue whales in the blue whale to complete the section.
and we're gonna have to wait for the killers to face the surface.
this month, maybe once or twice.
the team is running into a promising order, but it's a pretty unpleasant source.
look at those birds in the water!
we'll go take a look.
look at that!
i still don't understand what i just saw.
david saw her, she turned the camera.
he took a turn, went up and took a big diner.
you see them under water because they call them blue whales, you see them under water, shiny, burnt down by the blue ocean blonde.
i was upstairs trying to get another image of the krits in the upstairs, and honestly, it was the last time.
well, it probably took less than ten minutes, but without question, without question, without question, it was the most amazing thing i've ever seen.
to share water with a blue whale and never come to eye, never forget anything.
and the contrary.
yeah, it's a unique point of view we'll never see.
due to this close cooperation, the team has taken the blue whales in a film which has never seen before, and finally, the greatest hunt of the ocean has begun to unleash its life.
you like her!
no, i don't.
every friend i've ever tried to get to like her.
it's sad, isn't it?
when mia went as a change student, we made a list of our plus records, and we made a list of our feelings, and it was helping us make our feelings go out.
yes, ethan karakakakakov...
abigail called and sent the list of expressions to the whole school.
look, i'm coming to stay with you for a while.
no, i'm not gonna get in trouble.
i won't stay forever.
okay.
a pair of brent frappe.
and petit sink.
everyone thinks the ranch is a dangerous place.
relu.
i know every rabbit hole, broken fence and rusty nails.
and nice arm bracelets.
no matter where i am, i'm safe.
your wife, tara.
and blice.
everyone show up.
tara, you can join us.
but the academy is a completely different world.
if you think you know your way, think again.
you'll realize you're actually in a minefield.
i see a new trap...
"and smells like christmas...
"the way she eats.
" everything she's talking about is true."
could it be worse?
yes, as you asked...
at least i'm not the first minus in your list.
i guess i should be grateful for that.
i'm really sorry, kat.
i didn't mean to disturb you in my mess.
believe me, i have worked very hard not to feel this way.
here's a good reason.
my brother will break your heart, and when he does, i won't be there to fix it.
i promise i'll stay away from her.
you think abigail sent it to third grade?
ethan read.
kill me.
yes, a question for you.
who can tell me what the real meaning of deux is?
pas deux.
it means dances.
but what's the meaning of the french words, metaphorically?
pas deux.
two bodies, one soul.
a man and a woman dance to the same emotions.
that's what our lesson is today.
i never danced with a man before.
that's right.
at home, girls danced with girls.
no men.
guys in first class are just cute creatures who crush their fingers.
pas deux has three important rules.
trust.
a horse.
together.
great great great great great great great great
and, most importantly, communication.
without these, yes...
ethan, isabelle, it's very nice of you to join.
remember, to be together, you have to trust and communicate.
did your hands always do that?
i'm allergic to you.
focus on the person you dance with.
no one else should matter.
you want to drop it?
relax.
you're doing great.
what great class?
i mean, patrick's a great teacher.
don't you think the universe is trying to bring us together?
la-la-la-la-la.
before we left, we talked about you and miss raine going back to class the rest of your day.
don't get excited.
instead, you're gonna do me a exercise.
don't forget, you're going to be judged like the rest of your other lessons.
that was a blow!
i'm gonna be walking around with eyes tied up.
at least you don't have to spend 00 hours with abigail like me.
i'd rather scratch my eyes with a blind knife.
i know. 00 questions for our wives in 00 hours.
this?
"one of you may ask any questions any questions you may ask one of one person any questions
"but you must answer honestly."
it's like i want to know something about christian.
so you're not alone.
burcum, my favorite food favorite pizza, no lucky number, and we're done.
i know all about you.
your whole school is spreading alive.
where are you going?

i mean, it's made of meat and blood.
he's doing something.
you have to answer.

rules.
how far did you go with a man?
first love.
and there's a second vaccine.
has anyone been to your city?
have you ever kissed a man?
you didn't kiss, did you?
maybe i can help you.
maybe you can disappear before me.
hey, i had questions to ask.
and i'm trying to make my stomach stronger here.
we can make them on the beach.
i won't come to the beach.
are you allergic to fresh air?
i don't like the sand, i don't like salt and i don't like the sun.
great.
i need some water.
me too.
we hate you enough to ask you to die of thirst.
i don't care what her favorite color or her parents do.
so, did he say anything to you?
he did it!
"let's go to the beach for homework.
" this is gonna be fun!"
i didn't know she'd be here.
really.
what are you doing here?
third grade, we come to ourselves.
you're not supposed to be rattling here right now.
you can play with us if you want.
i may be blind, but i'm not blind.
come on, it's just football.
whoo!!!!o!!!
are you coming, tara?
i think i'm staying.
i haven't finished my homework with christian yet.
come on, let's get out of here.
you know, in this script, it's in the toilets.
you can.
no, i can't keep it for 00 hours.
i'm starving.
yeah, me too.
i go...
i'm gonna go get some food.
this place is closed against smoking.
find another bathroom.
why do men have to smell so bad?
why do you have to be so bad?
that's right.
they smell bad.
it was more than the crime and the hadd.
just think about it and finish it quick before we both die of oxygen.
i can't, please, can you do something like a song or something?
hurry.
i still don't understand why you sent that list to everyone.
you're just as uncomfortable as a sparkling flies all the time.
it just made you look bad.
okay, don't say anything.
there you go.
hey, where's tara?
i don't know.
huh.
whoa!
hey, baby.
i have a barracks room in my lap.
hey!
i wrote that, princess!
come on, we'll catch them later.
you want to die?
didn't you see what they were trying to do to me?
you can't keep a fight around here.
anyway, what are you still doing here?
if you want to know, i was waiting for the bus.
what did you see me in a limo?
you don't know anything about me.
i don't think i want to know.
i've never met anyone as rude as you.
your mother didn't teach you her witnesses?
he's dead.
look, if you're worried, all you have to do is call.
who said i was worried?
i'm just checking my messages.
what do you know?
i understand everything.
this communication thing must have started to work.
yeah?
can you see that?
ow.
i can't imagine what it's like to lose your mother.
no, you can't.
was he dancing?
yes, he was young.
is that why you wanted to enter the academy?
will you leave?
i won't stay.
i don't believe you.
i saw how you danced!
right.
she lives in brenok hill.
very good.
and let's say i got into trouble.
i don't know, probably.
you said you were close.
so you're saying he answered, right?
brothers help their sisters?
maybe she'll call him.
but the room calls another number, so he doesn't know i am.
now you know everything.
right or wrong?
i mean, i wanted to say it wrong, but...
see, you haven't learned anything.
my brother and i are very close.
i have one question left.
question 00.
let's ask.
why did you tell everyone i was dressed in the wrong dressing room?
you knew it was wrong.
why would i even bother?
i don't believe you're still lying about it.
i know you did.
you know, i wasn't the only man there.
have you thought about that?
tara, what were you thinking?
do you think... here?
do you think it says here or 0 or 00?
two and four hours.
you want to know why i'm bad against tara?
because you three are so stupid!
i need to talk to you.
like you don't know.
you've been laughing behind me all this time, haven't you?
pardon??????
you told everyone that i was in the wrong locker room for the audition weekend.
it was you, wasn't it?
come on, admit it was funny.
and leave me alone in the beach?
isn't it fun?
but you weren't with us.
no answers to the plus and express list?
i didn't realize i had to answer.
of course you had to.
all school laughs at me because of you.
why should it be because of me?
look, if you want to hear the truth, i'm ashamed of that list.
i mean, we've only talked to you three or four times, right?
and you went and wrote everything you felt and sent this to the whole school.
i don't even know you.
tara?
tara?
she can't talk to you.
yeah, he can talk.
i thought you were ill when your girls came to you after ethan.
because i hate seeing my friends sad.
when i grew up, my parents warned me of all the danger.
we all have to make it ourselves...
prove yesterday's homework wasn't a waste of time.
good work, guys.
whether we like it or not, we're tied to clues that won't be able to break each other for the next year.
so there's a long way ahead of us.
good morning.
good morning, bette.
uh-huh.
get dressed.
i want to be there when they open.
okay.
i already threw a candy.
one is enough.
your prescription.
you want butter?
here.
good morning.
be careful.
the inspector's here.
good morning, mrs. treont.
good morning, mr. korman.
mr. treont.
hi.
yeah.
what can i do for you, mrs. treont?
it says here that pork chocolate is sold.
that's all you've seen in the commercial.
how are those pork chops?
we're not selling them.
there's only pork chops in commercial, mr. korman.
no pictures or id numbers.
so what do you want, mrs. tremont?
i want these pork chops off that price.
all right.
jake.
hey!
jake.
u...
well, i'm sorry this is working on you first, john, but we have a staff problem to know.
this guy we're gonna get, he can't decide between us and goldman.
i know you hate this, but you need to get in here and use your magic wand.
is he that good?
let's not kidnap this guy.
these kids from business school think they're worth 000,000 dollars a week when they work a week.
i hate these attitude.
okay, set this up for the weekend with kathy.
i got notes for the next day.
the vale project gave us a pretty good direction, but i'm suggesting that we have reason to suggest that the investors, investors, that the company is so profitable.
they don't want to give their competition that much information.
i don't know why we have to cooperate with this guy in vale.
a dark type.
we risk your company's reputation.
if we refuse him, we won't get another job.
he requests a huge price and the banking office wants it.
i'm worried about my share of this year.
lower your price.
i think that's the first time i've been able to record about the karma.
yeah? yeah? yeah?
your sister, mr. treont.
he says it's important.
he should have talked to you right now.
i'm in a meeting.
john, this is about our mother.
he had a heart attack.
she's fine now, but she's serious.
can you come?
hey!
how was the flight?
good one.
that guy next to me didn't leave me alone.
he heard i was from wall street so don't ask.
"how are these stockings?
i see.
did you hear of a feel called chetromx?
mario.
seriously, someone from the math department told me about it.
they're building heat sensors for those who work low-fangled temperature caps.
it's bigger than the phone.
no.
no?
no.
good.
at home with your dad.
to the hospital first?
it doesn't matter.
let's go to the hospital.
i thought so.
how's dad?
to be honest, johnny, it's a little shaken up.
that's why annie's staying with her.
he doesn't want her to be alone.
so how's mom?
how serious is it?
he can't admit he had a heart attack.
he's lying there for a heart attack, and he says it's his stomach misery.
he blames me.
what do you mean?
she says it's because of the sausages i made for dinner.
he claim i tried to kill him.
did you do it?
no jury can blame me, john.
i believe you.
if you're here, i'm pretty sick.
look, mom, that's why you're the best.
in your case, many people wouldn't feel guilty.
how are you?
any pain?
i'm alive because of my will.
she'll tell you.
i have the will of a woman half my age.
don't fuck yourself.
have you seen your father?
no, i came straight from the airport.
if you see her, don't say anything about a heart attack.
just say something went wrong inside me.
okay?
mom.
listen to me.
it was just that something was wrong with me.
my priest will think i slept because my priest will be taken off.
okay.
if you have to eat outside, go to pardonald's or wendy's.
a simple place.
mom, you shouldn't worry about dad right now.
i think you should think about yourself right now.
you had a heart attack.
i'm not sure i had a heart attack.
that hurts like more gas pains to me.
mom, if you were a gas pusher, they'd give you acid drive.
they wouldn't tie you to $00 million-dollar machines.
did you see the doctor who took care of me?
because i don't believe he's a real doctor.
he was wearing a tight pants with a white pants on his big belt.
she can't be more than 00.
nowadays, they're grading everyone from medical school.
john! john! john! john!
god, good to see you.
you came and saw your mom first, huh?
yeah.
look at you, john, tell me the truth.
like my mother.
it was like he was going to drag his hooks into the hooks and get out of there.
i mean, it was just gas pounds.
i'm sure she told you that.
and irensi?
like a half-year-old woman.
you look so modern.
where shall i put your bags, sir?
oh, that's a lot of trouble.
thank you very much.
no luggage in the living room.
you know the rules.
i'm taking them out to your old bedroom.
is the living room still forbidden?
you're kidding.
this place looks just like smithson's.
dad's outside, huh?
yeah, in the green house.
what's he doing there?
mario said it was very difficult.
he's scared, john.
she's really scared.
i'm not sure you understand what's going on with her.
what do you mean?
he saw her, didn't he?
i didn't want to drag her there.
i told her that she wasn't accepting visitors, and she seems to understand that.
hi, dad.
hello, john.
good to see you.
you look good.
good to see you too.
i'll stay here a few days.
did you hear what happened to your mother?
how is she?
good.
good.
he wanted me to say hi and he said he'd be home soon.
something's wrong with your body, isn't it?
something like that.
your old room doesn't work well, you know.
you should use a second blanket.
okay.
the most important thing at the time you're here is to make sure everything's okay.
your mother has a reinforcement and her life is a really long routine.
and a sugar.
in the morning, they cut the plates, they make a shopping list.
this is important.
i wrote you a list of pills.
when did it get so bad?
it's been another year.
no, you're wrong.
what are you saying?
i was here for christmas.
annie, i need to know this.
okay, i saw her two years ago.
a lot happens in two years.
why didn't you tell me?
i tried to get her to us, but she wasn't comfortable.
we both work all day.
but here's his garden and his green house.
he knows the environment.
i can only stay here a few days.
then what do we do?
can't you stay longer?
i have to go to boston.
no way.
we need to bring someone home.
but we have to find the right person.
my father's old, john.
yeah.
come on, dad, let's hit the head, huh?
johnny.
i can't find my pajamas.
i don't know where your mother put them.
here.
why don't you wear them, dad?
i will.
are you okay?
i miss your mom.
he's gonna get what he needs.
a good rest.
he'll be home soon.
good night.
good night.
hold the lights on.
okay.
sleep well.
i don't eat much in the morning, johnny.
it was good, though.
thanks, dad.
you cook at home, don't you?
not really.
i've been eating out since sara and i divorced.
yes, she was a nice girl.
it still is.
how's billy?
she's in santa cruz.
he's in first class in college.
she came to visit once.
so you saw her more than i saw her.
look at this, johnnie.
it's a double pickup day at ralph's.
two cans tuna, $0.00.
amazing.
how much for tuna fish in new york?
it's not 0:00, i bet.
no, i disagree.
no way.
listen, dad, i want to talk to you about mom for a minute.
there's something you have to understand.
mom's sick.
it's not cancer, is it?
no, no, it's not cancer.
kill cancer, you know.
your uncle had surgery five times.
nothing happened to her.
look, i'm telling you, if you get cancer, you got to pack your bags.
look, it's not cancer.
a heart attack.
will she be okay?
yes, he'll be fine.
but it won't work hard like before.
he's gonna need to learn to take it slow and you need to help him with it.
i always tell her that you work too hard.
johnny, he works hard.
you need to learn a few things you can do at home.
look, mom made you believe that no one else would ever look after her.
we'll try to fix this wrong.
i got it, johnny.
i'm gonna learn how to do all this.
you'll see.
we'll make fun of her.
okay, dad, let's see, fox thing we should do,
"take the mine from the white."
so dark matter don't interfere with white colors.
copy that.
i think that's what your mother would have done.
now we know we're on the right track.
okay, now let's start with the colors, okay?
these are color.
color.
white, color, color.
white.
color.
color.
this?
him?
that white.
okay, that's color.
dad, it must be one of these.
i think we should call your mother.
i'm gonna do a job here.
okay.
what do you think we got?
"e, normal.
i'm called the "nmal."
what kind of water do we use?
"the cold, cold, cold, warm, warm, warm, warm, warm."
oh, what the hell is that?
hot.
i think it was white.
thursday's ready.
yeah.
what's the easier way to get to the store, dad?
i don't know much about these streets, john.
your mother will take us wherever we need to go.
you never drive?
nothing?
i can't.
a couple of years ago my license was up.
you didn't get another license?
well, they asked me to pass on a trial test for my age.
did you test it?
i disagree.
i was afraid i couldn't pass.
what are you saying?
you used a great car.
johnny, a good driver, who knows when to drive, that's all.
i couldn't remember what you liked, so i took less than anything.
great.
well...
these are beautiful.
i want to see your mother, johnny.
i don't think that's a good idea right now, dad.
i mean, my mother's fine, but they wouldn't want to accept visitors.
i'm her husband.
i need to see him.
that's not true.
perfect.
he made me breakfast this morning.
no, i'm not serious.
i don't know, it was a box.
yeah.
it's all right.
okay, mr.- colonel.
okay, dad.
annie's gonna meet at the hospital.
or maybe they'll let you see in a day or two.
good.
yeah.
what?
i can wash the dishes.
i code these cards according to their color.
there are different code cards here for the day housework.
for example, now, the pink ones are to wash dishes.
look at it, look at it, and the number got away.
number one: number one number one::
fill it with water."
okay.
number two?
"shout a little patience."
okay.
"fuck the stabs in the water."
i've prepared you to work for yourself.
these are great, johnny.
if i follow these cards, there's no reason for me to make a mistake.
i'll watch these.
i'll show you how to burn the stove, dad.
no, on the other hand, it's forbidden for now.
nothing.
and stay away from blender.
no apprentices.
i think i should work with this.
your mother wouldn't want me to wear this.
i look so rude.
like johnny cash.
you don't think that, do you?
no, dad, i don't think so.
don't take your weapons to town, son.
put those guns at home.
bang, bang.
" fill it up."
it's a professional floor, dad.
you can see yourself in the floor.
no cila blonde marks.
you know what i think?
i think we should reward ourselves.
what do you mean?
let's go out and have a good time.
what do you say?
okay.
okay.
what do you and mom do for fun here?
"i" 00 00.
"i" two-zero.
"o 00 "o 00 "o 00o
seven.
"b 00b 00 "b 00b 00
"b" is a-one.
look next up, okay?
"g' 00 00 00 "g' 00
five-eight.
are you kidding?
isn't air conditioning here, dad?
or a vantilator or something?
00... 00...
theu- coach!
i love them doing this.
they always do?
"b 0"b 0 "b 0b
and then!
boy, this is fun tonight.
"i" 00 00.
bingo!!!!!o!
bingo!!!!!o!
jake treont, is that you?
hal mccarthy.
how are you?
do you remember gloria?
my son, john.
he came to visit from new york.
how are you?
bette here?
no, in the hospital.
that's good to hear.
give us our past wishes.
we do.
thank you.
you heard about nick price, right?
dead.
oh, yeah.
nick, robin, dorothy, twins.
all of them.
that whole table.
and delores patcher next table.
gone.
dead.
well, good to see you again.
it's been a while.
a long time.
nice to meet you.
they're like fresh air.
i know their bingos.
you haven't been here long, have you, dad?
when was the last time you played here?
it's been three years.
you're kidding.
why did you stop coming?
i don't know.
we had a lot of fun with your mother here, but...
we don't do what we love anymore.
i don't know why.
i think you should remember what you enjoy and start doing them again.
that's a good idea.
john, i'm gonna write this.
i'll make a list of things we enjoy.
yes, sir.
bingo.
what? what?????
i think you did bingo.
hey, bingom!
i was worried about you, john.
i'm afraid you're gonna be a mipel.
we should take a look at this.
we can win, and we can get regular gain.
i know a computer boy in new york, so let me consult him.
it's great between numbers.
he's gonna make a system for us.
you'll see.
we're gonna beat these guys, dad.
i'm sorry i didn't want to leave you so late.
it's like christmas night.
the only thing missing here is guy lombardo.
he's dead.
hell, hal mccarthy didn't talk about it.
big day tomorrow.
let's go to bed.
good night, john.
good night, dad.
"b 0"b 0 "b 0b
and then.
there they are, dad.
hi, dad.
you're kidding me.
are you ready to see him, dad?
i can't believe my dad looks this good.
is that what you think?
thanks to you, john.
i'm good because of him.
that was fun.
listen, i hired someone to take care of the house.
it's gonna be a couple of days.
i can stay home until mom gets home.
really?
yeah, no problem.
hey, bette.
are you okay?
uh-huh.
do you swallow your blood pressure pills?
are you eating?
yeah, i'm fine, bette.
i can make my own bed now.
i wash dishes.
john's teaching me to cook.
she's like a real wife.
just keep her alive until i get back.
thanks for the push.
mom looks good, doesn't she?
yeah, great.
i can't go anywhere without my tube.
i mean the color of your face, mom.
my color?
what are you, a decorator?
don't call me mom.
am i calling you my son?
don't be so nice to my mom, mario.
you're gonna kill him.
why are you cooking?
there was dinner in the fridge.
i told you.
we wanted some change, that's all.
we ate salmon last night.
we ate de 'coq au vin the night before.
your father doesn't like foreign food.
just chicken with red wine.
that red wine shouldn't drink.
mom, that was it.
when i'm here, i don't want her to turn into a alcohol.
nobody eats 'coq au vin's, no drunk.
calm down, bette.
don't worry about everything.
just focus on healing here and don't worry about me.
are you sure you want to come, dad?
it's gonna be a long meeting.
no, i will.
i'll be fine.
i can get you a lunch here, you can watch a movie.
i'll sit down, i'll read a magazine.
i'll be fine.
okay.
i want to see john tremont, vic walton, please.
he's waiting for you.
dad, are you gonna be able to relax here between all this?
nobody's gonna drop anything on me.
john, good to see you.
sorry for the mess.
nice to see you, too, vic.
this is my father, jake treont.
dad, this is vic walton.
nice to meet you, mr. treont.
me too.
can we be here in an hour?
like i said.
okay, well, take care, dad.
wait a minute.
we can't leave your father here.
come on, mr. tremont, why don't you come in and sit with us?
i thought--
ralph, we've given you all of your pre-tests and now our guess is 00 percent less than yours.
how can you be so sure of yourself?
you-you've never followed anything like this.
and if you're wrong, we're gonna be the mask of the universe, and we're not gonna have another job with you.
forget about the concert factory.
he loses money every minute he's open, but at least he's worth 00 million.
how can you be so sure of $00 million?
we'll give you $00 million in a little treat.
do you have backup information?
can i talk to you now?
we have nothing to do with all the transporting jobs around $00 million a million dollars.
they're able to take over all the general goons, but we've got the plan in our hands, which we're gonna have to take out 00 percent of the staff in a few months.
just selling isn't enough?
that way the accounting records will take care of them.
this isn't gonna have to work.
i don't think they're focusing on this.
we can change that.
the other subject is a good industry for food balls, which is good.
now, our transplant plan in our chapter seems to be intolerable, but your satisfaction isn't countless.
we don't have a problem taking credit from the lottery when we count everything.
yeah, that looks good.
johnny, what's going on out there?
well, we're gonna get a salmon fish cans, dad.
i didn't know you had that information.
actually, i don't know.
the man who came to us for money has no information.
we're just gonna get the company and then we're gonna end it.
is this your job?
you're buying companies, and then you close it?
it's a little complicated, dad.
we're picking up this concert factory in this case.
then the company's a mess.
this third generation's board is on patrol, and it's terribly humiliating.
but there's a little paravan company, and that's the record of business.
the factory is near a worthy land.
so we get the factory, we close the door, then we take over to the paravanavan company, and then we sell the land.
have you ever considered running these companies?
that's no money, dad.
the world has changed, johnny.
you can't believe how the world changed.
when you were a little kid, you used to go work for me and lockeed, remember?
i'd rip off their wigs and touch them.
i'd pay 00 cents a day, and i'd buy some ham and cheese sandwiches.
when you grew up there with me, you said you wanted to work for me.
but now what you're doing is buying it and then shut it down.
did you hear anything about those guys from lockeed, dad?
rickson?
tommy williams???????
they're all gone.
to the valley, palmings...
there was nobody there to say goodbye to me.
the next morning, there wasn't anybody doing what i did.
the two world group split up to two world group:
...the clans and the bosses.
i don't know, dad, i think i--
it's all right, johnny.
there's nothing wrong here.
i'm a worker, that's all.
but you're different.
you like being in control.
you like to take responsibility.
you're a boss.
mom?
what do you think?
okay, dad.
"if you don't find the owner of a car and the owner of a car parked parked parked in a car parked parked park
why are you doing this?
i was already past the written test.
i know, but you might not be too careful.
many of the sample here might be in the license exam.
i want to prepare you for this.
very good.
thank you.
we've come this far.
i don't want to see anything go wrong now.
they want us to pull over here.
go.
slow, slow, not so fast.
okay, stop.
there he is.
jake treont?
it's actually jake treont.
i'm his son, john.
i guess you didn't need to know that, but you heard.
you can't sit here during the test, sir.
oh, i'm sorry.
oh, you can't stay in the car.
what are you talking about?
this is my father.
that's the rules.
i won't test as long as you sit in the car.
now you get out, and your dad's kind of a failure on the test.
is everything okay?
you'll be fine.
when you get out of your car park your car park the traffic--
john?
i'm leaving.
i'll check the bike and the other cars.
yes!! yes!! y
while waiting at the left turn, give them priority to the car that came through the ship.
make sure all the cars can be dangerous.
yes!! yes!! y
oh, look who's here.
hey, dad.
hey, billy.
he...
my grandmother was ill.
i ran right away.
i thought you might need me, grandpa.
don't even think about helping your grandfather.
when was the last time you ate?
why are you americans so obsessed with food?
you know, in rome...
what were you doing in mexico?
the semester vacation.
a couple of my friends are there.
dad, you say that every time we meet.
and i've been growing up for two years.
how's your mother?
good.
third year in law school and first grade.
it's embarrassing if your mom gets more notes than you do, but we work.
send my love.
how are you?
sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
if i know you, you're winning more than you lost.
if you're finished, let's have a piece of cake.
he looks so good.
what's going on?
well, we spend a lot of time together.
good time, huh?
they say this is very good for parents and children.
maybe you and i should spend more time together.
this looks great, grandpa.
too much.
you're looking good.
i'll give you a name after that, bill.
butter?
you want some butter, honey?
i want to raise my glass.
aha.
a lot has happened in the last two weeks.
we've overcome some of the hardships, we've had pain.
we had them all as a team.
time for thanks.
great, mario.
it's my usual speech.
actually, i'd like to say that it's nice to see our family together and happy.
my chicken's getting cold.
it's over.
very good.
i'm taking a toast.
hmm.
wow, dad.
my dear bride.
your bride?
have you been drinking today, jake?
before you came, mom, we had a couple of chalice au vin.
my dear bride...
bette, welcome back to our family, where you are.
it's good to be home.
listen, listen.
nice talk, dad.
it's nice to have everyone here.
and i don't remember the last time john billy and i were together.
billy looks good.
i like that earring.
should i?
if you want, i have a needle to wake her up.
oh, leave her alone, mom.
looks great.
i bet the girls will jump on you.
don't worry about me.
this isn't embarrassing.
dorm girls are male.
is that right?
yeah, and she's-- she's a mess in our dorm.
good thing we didn't have time.
i couldn't have finished school.
as if you were a student to me.
mario was a great student, mom.
she graduated from physique.
he didn't even read the book, and he's finished with the lips.
yeah, but all the good students, they also read me books, and they're done with me.
but john was a good student.
thank you, mommy.
we would go out every friday night to the library.
we'd buy three books.
you'd read them, we'd give them back, we'd get three new books.
you did more than that.
so how did it work?
were the girls on the other floor?
somebody shut that man up.
i'm just happy.
let's make things easier for grandma and grandpa while you're here.
of course, you've been getting too much to hear, but you can't believe it's true.
i believe me.
my locks are still zonk.
i'm sorry.
so when do you have to get back to school?
i'm not going back to school.
i'm thinking about hanging out in mexico for a while.
what's mexico's joke?
all mexicans try to come here.
did you know that?
there are some kids from school.
they're very similar.
oh, that's good.
yeah, fun, but believe it or not, you're gonna want to work one day, bill.
it's not gonna do you any good in mexico.
if you don't want to be a marachi singer, you've got to finish school, no matter what.
i can say i went to college.
i got the doctor.
i did the right thing.
two doctors.
one of the chemists, one of the physical.
i'll be back in new york soon, and i want to put this in your way.
what does your mother think?
he thinks i can make my own decision.
i'm not sure how i feel about it.
we need to talk more about it.
i don't know why.
never talked about it so far, and i know what i want.
johnny, something's wrong.
can you come over here and take a look?
that's enough, mr. treont.
you can get dressed if you like.
is she ok?
yeah, good.
it's a troubling process.
it's not spread yet.
what do you think the problem is?
could be one of a couple things.
i doubt he's a kciste in the urine cut.
the problem is whether she's a good heart.
is this gonna show up on your tests?
not completely.
it's not a good sign.
so it's serious?
i think we should spend it on a general operation.
if it was serious, dad, they wouldn't let you go.
they'd open up right now and surgery under the spots.
i wouldn't be surprised if it was just a person.
i don't think we should tell my mother.
why worry if there's nothing in the middle?
whatever you say, johnny.
you're the boss.
she told you, didn't she?
of course he did.
then you know there's nothing serious about it.
if it's not serious, you should have told me yourself.
look, mom, you need to stay away from a possible stress.
you're gonna get upset.
that's why i didn't tell you.
he says it's just a kist.
that's right.
it's gonna be a simple operation.
yes, it is.
mom, i'd tell you if something went wrong.
be sure.
okay.
am i going to walk around here like this, john, and all the nurses around here, i'm just gonna walk around like an open ass?
yeah.
that's what it says here on your accept form here,
"ass is law."
let's go to bed.
you need to sign this, dad.
what?
i don't have any baseball gloves.
that was a joke.
your doctor santana made these pills.
it'll just relax you.
if you have too much, i'll take a piece of it.
extra money for the private room.
what time?
it's night.
it's not late yet?
no.
are you comfortable, dad?
i'm fine.
let me get some rest.
it'll make you sleep like a baby.
okay.
remember, if you need anything, just press that bell.
that's all, huh?
you'll be fine.
you know, john, i see some guys, they hug each other.
we never embraced.
shall we try?
come on.
i love you, johnny.
me too, dad.
well, mr. tremont, i'm afraid it's cancer.
cancer.
we ran into a few bad-ass tumor.
your father won't be an old man.
well, it's a ridiculous question, but are you absolutely certain?
yeah.
the good thing is we can get to it and destroy it.
listen, dr. santana.
whatever you do, don't tell my dad that he has cancer.
he's very alarming, and he's afraid of that word.
say something more reasonable.
calm down, mr. treont.
you'd be surprised what others have been through.
they don't even care about it.
i'm not underestimating this, doctor.
i just want to tell her that, that's all.
it's cancer, right?
mom, i told you.
it's just a kist and they'll take it.
i want to see him.
mom!
mom, you can't see her now.
listen to me?
you shouldn't be subjected to this shape stress.
if everything's okay, let me see her.
oh, come on, mom!
only john wants your good.
you know.
you should listen to her, mom.
he's my husband and i'll see him.
now you take me there, or i walk, but i go.
what's there?
billy, go find dr. santana soon.
come!
get out of here.
what happened to her?
jake, it's me!
why didn't he recognize me?
jake!!!! jake!
mr. treont, i'm dr. santana.
do you know who i am?
i'm fine.
i'm fine now, thank you.
give me 00 mg my librium and check it out in two hours.
okay, doctor.
that's exactly the same situation with other patients.
they often go into shock after any simple operation.
is that standard?
do you know what's going on inside?
i know this is a frightening experience for you, but what you have to understand is the situation here.
he wasn't depressed when he came here.
why is that now?
this is a strange thing.
and it goes.
a stress like this happens suddenly.
i'm sure she'll be okay with a good rest and medication.
what do we do, by the way?
nothing.
what do you mean "nothing"?
we'll wait for the drug to answer the treatment.
did you tell dad he had cancer?
she has the right to know.
i don't know exactly what you want from me, mr. treont.
dr. ethge,
i don't trust santana.
you're the hospital manager, and what i want to say is that he doesn't comfort us.
your doctor is a good young surgeon.
it seems your father is perfectly professional and professional.
i told him that i never told him that cancer was cancer because he's too scared of that word.
but what he did, he just left and told him.
yeah, that's hard for every doctor to say.
he's got to keep the balance in the rights of your father's information with his family members.
i'm sure he had no choice.
he had a choice.
he should have listened to me.
i know my father.
why did you tie her arms?
not hurting yourself.
he was hitting himself with his hands.
well, then i'm her son and i think she doesn't need these.
let us know when you're ready, and we'll put him in.
i can't believe it.
hey, dad, how's it going?
is it always like this?
look, hey, look, look, i brought annie.
and billy's here.
hey, dad.
how are you feeling, dad?
can you hear me?
hey, grandpa, it's me, billy.
how's it going?
god, john, i can't stand being here looking like that.
i think that's enough.
i gave it to her.
this will calm her down.
how long has she been like this?
all the time we've been here.
did he look depressed?
god, doctor.
good thing you're not a detective.
yeah, he seemed depressed.
what the hell is going on here?
i mean, i mean, i meant something unusual, mr. tremont.
mr. tremont--
don't keep telling me that his situation is unusual, doctor.
it's not unusual depressing, but it's true, but it's going to bring him to himself.
sedative?
he's hallucinating.
he's screaming.
he doesn't know any of his parents, and you just gave him a sedative?
why didn't you give him the cake?
maybe his throat hurts too!
we decided to release your father tomorrow.
you can pick her up after 00:00.
what do you mean, "taburic"?
you want to tell me my father's cured?
well, of course not, but there's nothing we can do to her if we have to speak in the medical language.
we can't take the bedrooms for patients we can't help the medical road.
how would we know?
she never took any medical help!
what exactly do you mean?
whatever i say.
that means they don't care if they're dead.
what kind of talk is that?
you didn't think--
just relax.
you want my father out of here?
look what i'll do.
i'll do better than you can.
i understand you can't take care of her.
john, what are you doing?
don't touch her.
that's not necessary.
i'm telling her i'm taking her home.
mr. treont, what you've done is very unpleasant.
what do we do now?
i don't know.
we don't have much choice, but we don't have-
no, i don't want to do this.
i don't want to take her to a home.
me too, john, but we have to do something.
wait a second, john.
in that case you can't help him.
i think i can do this.
i'll do better than the hospital can.
i'll stay and help.
no.
why not?
i'll look at bern.
he's my father.
well, he's my grandfather.
i'm your father.
i don't want you here right now, billy.
you shouldn't see that.
dad, i'm not a kid.
look, i think you should go.
go back to your school, go back to mexico.
you're from here.
don't you understand?
yeah, i get it.
i want to talk to him.
i don't think that's a good idea right now, mom, really.
annie's right, mom.
to the funeral car.
you'd like that, wouldn't you, mario?
i mean, "araba" to me, mom.
it was just a slicer.
he'll be fine.
john's gonna take care of him.
let's go, dad.
this goo boy is great, right?
the playboy reminds me of bob gibson.
you know, a real player.
you got it, dad?
good.
come on.
madens.
we're gonna have to work on the boat a little bit.
okay.
what you need is some home food.
well, i think you're right.
wait till you taste this.
come on, dad.
okay.
hmm, okay.
here.
try this.
come on, dad, bite a piece.
come on, here we go.
let's try our luck.
dad, the glass stuff isn't bite.
house rules.
you don't like it there, do you?
neither did i.
we're gonna be okay, huh?
come on, dad.
that's better.
okay, dad.
wait a minute and i'll put you to bed.
i'll put these in.
why are we here, ed?
why aren't we in the ranch?
what? what?????
you know, if we stay, they'll wonder, you know.
where is the host?
this is your home, dad.
what are you talking about?
mandy hasn't come back from the tea, ed.
i'm worried about her.
well, don't worry, dad.
i-i'm sure he's okay.
you think so?
it is.
i need 00 nails for the cluster, help me.
now it needs to be done.
look.
what we need right now is a good night's sleep.
don't you always say that you always have a problem:
let's go to bed."
i mean, right now we have problems, dad.
let's go to bed.
dad?
dad?
dad?
dad, where are you?
dad?
dad?
dad?
dad?
what do you think you're doing here?
oh, dad, come on, let me help you.
come on, dad, come on.
no.
dad, i'm gonna lift the bed.
come on out.
come on, dad, get out.
dad, come on.
i got you.
shh.
come on.
shh.
i got you, i got you.
i got you.
mr. tremont??????
i understand you brought your father back to the hospital.
yeah.
i thought it would be hard for you to look at her at home.
that's no place for her right now.
he can't do it at home, he can't do it here, can he?
maybe it'd be better if she just walked up the hill with a helicopter.
i know it's hard for kids to accept their parents' age.
i don't know what that means.
i know what it's like to be old.
mr. treont, you don't forget doctors are human.
we can't handle all the problems.
we can't save every patient.
we live in a system where old people have finally had a tough breakdown.
what is your request?
why are you here?
there's another doctor in this hospital.
i think he can do better than dr. santana.
what? what?????
i'm kicking everything that's said.
he's a good man.
i want her to take a look at your father.
mr. tremont??????
mr. tremont??????
how are you, mr. tremont?
let's do a couple ofta.
well, let's get an eg, and we'll get the metabolics.
let's take the kaludum-mimm-m-marezium and run a life run.
i'm not so sure what caused this, but i'm diagnosed now that it's quite a epileptic.
the question is, what caused it?
and why not?
if you're saying we're gonna do another console about this, please do it.
no, that's not necessary.
well, don't think we're gonna sit here and do nothing.
we don't think so.
so far we've done a series of tests and we'll do more.
so far, all we've done is shoot the darkness.
i appreciate your humility, doctor.
but these tests have been made long, haven't they?
she's gonna sleep here for a while, ... . . we're gonna watch her from the monitor any minute now.
and i'm gonna check him twice a day and visit him.
i'm not leaving until she gets better.
i'm afraid that's completely against hospital rules.
how long can you stand it?
i don't know.
i'm going once a day.
i'm sitting.
i'm talking to her.
i'm talking to the people.
if i sit there and talk, i think he's dead.
what if he dies?
annie, i never--
you're the only one who can't accept it, john.
why don't you let her go?
i can't explain that to you.
maybe i should be there when it's over.
i don't know.
to prove he's still here.
to prove i was his son.
what did you do so positive now?
annie, this man went to work every day in his life and never liked it.
we never asked him.
he did it because it was his father and he had no choice.
she never asked me if i'm happy for myself.
he never knew whether or not he had the right.
we should take care of her when she's alive, and take care of her.
but i screwed this up.
john.
i'm against him, but my mother has overcome him.
she's alive now.
i'm a shame because i've made a bad marriage, and i have an incredible job, and i have a son who barely knows me.
maybe it'll be too hard for me,
but i'll be there when she's dead.
and i'm gonna kiss her, and i'm gonna cover her top,
and then i'm gonna draw the gold i'm there.
i owe it to her.
when did you get to town?
i never left.
i'm staying with some friends.
i didn't want to leave my grandpa.
you come here every day?
when you leave, a nurse is looking for me.
i'm standing over a half hour.
where am i, johnny?
you're in the hospital, dad.
i can understand that.
why are you here?
or was it a car accident?
talking?
yeah, he's talking.
she learns like a child.
go, ee, report this to dr. chad.
please, please.
why'd she look at me like that?
oh, he's a hospital too, dad.
she's a nurse.
this is molly, this is cecey, e, this is annie.
this is my father.
okay, mr. treont.
how can we make you comfortable?
you can start by taking these pipes off me.
then i better eat something.
are you gonna starve me here?
okay, first we need to take it slow.
remember, you haven't eaten in a long time.
maybe that's why i'm like this.
did you think that?
all tests are positive, their lives are stable.
that's a healthy human prof.
i've seen people come out of a coma before.
we don't usually find out why.
i have some theory about that.
that's why i can't say that.
like what?
somehow the last serum we gave him, and we gave him our most unfortunate, and we're lucky.
i see.
you know, when we get home, we're all like this.
but in return, it was your love and interesting and interesting that you brought your father back from where he went.
i think it's better that way.
me too.
they're here.
what's going on, dad?
what are you looking for?
your mother and i are starting a new life together, johnny.
we need new clothes.
i don't know, dad.
what do you think mom would say about these?
he'll probably laugh at me and call me crazy, but he'll laugh.
we've been laughing at home for 00 years.
how about that?
thank you.
thank you, thank you.
ladies, ladies, our show starts.
no matter how drunk you get during your performance, please stay in your place.
the contractor who's gonna give the number one star of our show's show a star's tailor's asshole, especially the priest, and a man who's already come back from the funeral, with a man, a success, a success, a man, a man, a
great jake.
i'm asking him a big applause.
come on, a big applause.
moving on.
and her kitchen friend, billy!
ladies and gentlemen, billy!
that's my dress for when i'm on a bike on the beach on the beach in venete.
maybe when we're skating.
that's my baseball dress.
look?
i think i'm gonna wear this at home more.
actually, i can go see some games, but not in these clothes.
good to hear that, jake.
wait.
there's another one.
do it again.
oh, my pants!
stop them!
i'm dying!
i didn't hear anyone laughing, bette.
but wouldn't that be good?
i'm telling you, johnny, it's not the same.
maybe his hormones are involved with someone else's.
you know what happens in the hospital.
nobody's gonna believe he's 00 years old and he's about to die a few weeks ago.
you should talk to someone, i mean it.
mom, she's just having fun.
we played only one golf, but still...
perfect day.
take us somewhere after breakfast?
that's a good idea.
maybe mom'll come with us.
i'm not riding in his car.
it used to take a lot faster.
i hate to think about what she likes right now.
don't worry about your beautiful little head, bette.
you'll be safe at the bed of old jake treton while you're at the wheel of the car.
and this is gonna be fun.
what are you looking for?
nothing.
i still want to see if i can still pull this off.
i call it the old man's castle.
what are you gonna do, bette?
are you coming to the beach?
i'm coming, but with a taxi.
i don't want to go with the taxi.
i think we'll sail in santa monica.
that's old people's heaven.
there's either a office or a bank in every corner.
i want to drive to venetian.
oh, i used to love fishing.
where are my team?
i think i put them in the garage somewhere.
it was 00 years ago.
i'll go get them.
she'll be fine.
johnny, i'm scared.
either he's talking about people i don't know, or people i'm sure he's dead.
he says we live in a farm in new jersey cole may, and now he's going to take us there because it's time to make it.
what? what?????
dad.
she told you, huh?
what's going on?
drive me around.
john, i need to talk.
johnny, johnny,
...what are the odds that i'm living with your mother and four kids in new jersey cape may?
i don't think you have a chance, dad.
isn't there a chance to be in a little ranch there?
i don't have four kids there?
you, annie, hank and little lizbeth?
as far as i know, dad, you've been living in l.a. for 00 years.
you had a regular job until you'd retiring from lockeed.
before that, we lived in the beachfield and you worked for locke.
i know you're right.
i'm saying, how can you be in two places at the same time?
i mean, i mean, my life in the same here as here,
i just sit and watch the ocean.
if that's very tech or very fantastic, then stop to me.
your father, as laing's describe, "an appreciated schizophrenic."
over the years, she starts not enjoying her diary life enough, and she's watching things she's enjoying herself.
she's made more of a life she desires.
how long has this been going on?
it's hard to say now.
at least 00 years, maybe more.
incredible.
you understand, it's very clever to do this, very smart, very wise, very sensitive and emotionally.
and where is mommy in all this?
she was thrown out of these?
you're frozen in time.
your mother is very helpful, very sweet.
isn't that the most important thing in the world?
she has a influence.
the problem is that your father's whereabouts in this world belongs to your mother.
he's been a happy person since he's been beaten up.
the walls that separate her two worlds have been broken.
and he's brought the fun that he's been keeping from his life for years to come.
if your mother doesn't agree to her, she'll just get lost and gone.
hello, all the beautiful people here.
maybe i'll do some jogging on the bike road.
what do people think if they see you like this?
who cares?
i don't want people to call us old bastards.
and don't care what people think anymore.
just ignore what some young people look at what we wear.
i'm coming with you, dad.
good boy, good boy.
don't worry about me.
i'm gonna go to newark and get some stuff for the farm.
hey, mom, i told you what the doctor said.
you need to help her sometime.
none of that comment will solve anything.
the man lives in another time slice.
you have to show it to her.
that's all.
i told you, it's just a dream.
a well designed and wonderful imagination.
dad learns how to separate two worlds now.
it's called that.
i don't care what you say.
something happened to her.
this man is not your father.
i think that's the real jake treton.
he's been hiding this for 00 years.
hi.
i'm jake treont, this is bette tremont.
your neighbours across the road.
of course.
how can i help you?
okay.
this is christopher.
how's it going, young man?
and say hi to mr. traemont, chris.
hi.
hi.
if you look for someone to take care of a kid, we're all home.
oh, that's very kind of you.
thank you.
no, no, no, it's a dog sleeping.
that's him.
it's a dog sleeping.
yeah.
yeah, he's... too fast.
come...
maybe we could-- maybe we may
we wanted to say hi.
we brought you some cake.
come in.
maybe she's just snuck out.
did you hear strange noises last night?
why, did you hear?
i think i heard something.
i think it must be the wind.
" close the door" "" """ "
they come with a "r"
how's it going with dad?
the doctor thinks it's okay.
he's trying to get into my bed at night.
she's not leaving me alone.
your father was always a sexy man, but he's been crazy since he got back from new jersey.
when we first got married, i told my friend fanny hogan what we did to your father, and he told me to leave him to the police.
when i confession with the priest, he said he'd pray for me.
but it didn't work.
you know, when your father was warned, the cops, priests, prayers, nothing can stop him.
oh, grow up.
"i'm a little, short, fat cup of tea"
" here's my pervert my mouth."
" when this br br br br br br br br br br br
"you hear my heart"
bend me and smoke in me!"
oh, bingo.
here.
you know, i realized something.
we don't speak japanese.
you realize that's new?
we should try to recognize a new country one night a week.
we just have to eat the food of that country and talk about the language.
we have to do this.
no, we shouldn't.
" where's the train station?"?"?" where's
" where's the train station?"?"?" where's
what are you doing?
i'm trying to find the train station.
i think that's a good idea.
it's working.
i feel like japanese.
oh, yeah, annie, give us some sample, please.
clothes, huh?
"the japanese women's clothes...
"it's different than the people.
"like women in the countries like their husbands...
"dress and trainers.
" this is a new one coming in,
"to make it harder for people to break their sexes because they don't have the hiding of the beards of beards."
i don't know about you, but i don't want to be in a country where i can't separate people's sexes.
i mean it.
this just happened to me in a bar.
john, john, tell us about the u.s.
"in this country of these mountains, the only 00 percent of the laptop can be heard."
can you pass the rice, please?
if you say that japanese.
"please pass the monster, please."
you're welcome.
come on, mom.
live the case.
no.
no.
no.
billy, go on.
japanese sports.
what have you made for us?
"sumo wrestlers, sumo clothes and...
"...and they have to reach 000 pounds of weight before they're punished."
that's a big idea.
make her fat as fat as you can, then put her in a diaper.
john, don't you think these people are interesting?
mario, i'm starting to worry about you.
honey, please tell me...
wait a minute.
pass, pass...
what do you want?
what about the fish?
do you want him?
here.
no, i don't, jake.
i don't eat this.
i don't want to know japanese.
i don't want to know the neighbors' kids.
mother, please...
i wanted to walk but now i know what i got.
but since she got back from the hospital, this place has returned to the asylum.
clothes, jogging, hours of sex.
and in new jersey-da-da-un-an farm!
i'm telling you, this guy can't even be left alone on the street.
my dad's really good.
he just wants to have fun!
i didn't live my life like this!
a crazy old man like my friend!
you know that better.
the doctor said he wasn't crazy!
the truth is, she has lived under your attack for 00 years!
oh, don't.
please don't.
don't tell your mother that stuff.
please.
we're family.
let's trust each other.
everybody love each other and let's forget.
and please don't fight.
that's how you talk to me.
why?
why are you doing this?
you're gonna make her old again.
that's not what you want.
i want my husband back.
he wants his life back.
she loved you 00 years.
can't you just leave her alone?
i'm scared, jake.
i don't know who you are.
i don't know you.
i know.
look at me or... and see the old man they see and see.
but inside me, thank god, bette, i feel 00 years old.
and i'm pretending, i guess.
your other life, jake, he's giving it to me.
what's so bad for me?
we're a little off the border.
a little.
are you asking me to go back to our old life?
oh, no.
i'm asking you if you want us to go back to life.
you were good.
not just me, to the world...
we used to have a good time, remember?
we always danced slow.
you were a pretty good dancer.
and i would like to dance with you one last time before i die.
don't talk about death.
dying is not a sin.
life too.
good morning, mom.
good morning.
nice outfit.
your father loves it.
mr. tremont??????
i have some news.
not good.
what is it?
well, it doesn't look the same in every case, but, uh...
okay, good doctor, you can tell me the truth.
cancer's back.
spread.
he's infected his lymphies.
how much?
it's hard to say.
every patient looks different.
dr chad?
i don't know.
hey, dad, what are you doing at this hour?
i'm waiting for you.
why?
you see, your mother and i got divorced too little to come home late.
as a father, i think i've lost concern for my son.
you want me to go out and come back?
no, just sit down and talk.
what would you like to talk about?
i'll try to tell you something.
as your father, i'd like to give you some advice.
some vision.
i can't think of anything.
it might be hard for you to understand someone my age.
you know, every time we meet, we're on the move.
you go, i come, or we're at someone's wedding.
all we're talking about is bags, bags, little sandwiches we could eat.
i don't know much about you.
well, uh, look, i'm, uh, i'm, uh,
i love the sports, i love the bikes...
you know, we always do the same thing.
we'll come to the yankee, ...one to say something real... and then one of us will joke.
talk to me.
tell me about mexico.
i love it.
ah, there are people and understanding.
well,... life goes there in a ritual.
do you have a lot of friends there?
yes, there are five of us.
you know, we hang out as a group.
we work together.
we share everything we do.
we share the cleaning, homework.
we're a real family.
other guys from school?
well, they're both girls.
life has changed, billy.
it's hard to believe that he's changed his life.
why is money coming before your mother and me?
oh.
you said you wanted to talk.
okay.
because, uh, this is about what a man was before.
dad wears a suit and makes good money.
okay, that's easy.
because i love it.
it's nice to be the one... who's good, everybody's running it for him.
and i should have been given something and this was my family.
well, i never did that.
i never got away from my family.
it was the hardest thing to escape me.
that didn't look like it.
i mean, because we wanted to be normal.
that's what the books say.
"mal" divorce.
but it hurt.
a little.
it still hurts.
i miss you, billy.
and you never felt the need around me.
but i like to stay in your life.
i'm your father.
i've kissed you.
someone i feel debt to.
what is it?
forgiveness.
a little sleepy.
were you here all afternoon?
it feels better when i'm here.
let's go down and get something to eat.
the doctor will be here soon.
i don't want to kidnap her.
i'll catch up to you.
come on.
where's mom?
billy and something went down for dinner.
oh, good.
how do you feel?
perfect.
i can say good.
you know what i think?
what? what?????
0000 yankees-dodgers games.
what? what?????
i'm trying, but all my mind came from all my mind and the old games and the old knees.
bonza.
oh, that's great, dad.
what about the 0000 yankees-dodgers games?
who took it?
this is the biggest event in baseball history.
the players yanke yankees middle middle middle middle middle fake joe dimagagagagagogo, player of the player, prensensen, stencils, stair dodger, dodger,
alionfriddo, number two.
it's just that left wings player...
carlurillo played because he was cripple.
you know this story?
tell me.
okay, in the sixth game, during the time of the watchman shooter was in front of a 0-0 dodgers.
two in, two out.
it's in dimaggio.
he threw the left ball to the belly of the wing, and made the most famous run.
everyone there knew that.
but that little man gionfriddo has turned up.
after the ball.
but joe didn't get the ball to kill dimaggio.
at the last moment, he jumped.
lived forever.
but the big deal came.
dimago began his second tour, he saw that gionfrido caught the ball next.
he's been so depressed, he kicked the underwear.
do you like this?
this man who never knew his feelings, was a human being.
it was al gionfrido who brought her feelings out.
you know what that means to me?
what?
in america, anything is possible if you do your job well.
sometimes i wish i could take more care of you when you were a kid.
i wish i could kiss you more.
you did it, dad, you did it.
do you know how much i love you?
yeah.
a lot, johnny.
sometimes good, sometimes bad.
honey, i'm putting these in the car.
okay.
did you talk to my mom?
my mother's staying here for now.
until next month.
we'll look at the situation later.
okay.
i think she'll be okay.
how are you holding up?
i miss her.
yeah, me too.
go first, i'll catch up with you.
one moment, please.
you go.
um...
grandpa, we just wanted to say goodbye to you before we...
well, and we decided this was the right place to do it.
because there's a lot of you here.
you have something living and growing up.
as for what i think of you...
that was fun.
yeah.
grandpa, i love you and i'll always miss you.
my father and i are here together.
that's good.
that's a good idea.
i feel better.
me too.
all and all they're saying is that the black trash of the black trash invites the progress and invites the progress of progress.
he was looking at me like he was trying to expose a mystery to me.
_
but as far as i'm concerned about political events this year, it's not going to be the same quality ceremony that i understand.
the traditional rules are the rest of it now, and we'll pay it back by tomorrow.
tell me, is there anything else you're afraid of?
please don't help them so quickly.
but honestly, i designed a series of more betting equipment that i knew you'd be interested in your high intelligence.
speaking of surgery, zitto's farm died a two-headed ice cream in zitto's farm.
the last one you brought was when i stabbed you with a knife.
a card can only show the fate of fate not only the nature of one person.
it represent the sacrifice.
i should introduce myself as a military engineer, not an artist.
why doesn't night guard give that man a rest?
the man's blade was so fluffy and now he finds himself looking at this beautiful sword.
because if you ask people, they say i can use both of my hands very well, and that i can use very well, and that i'm very comfortable with both my hands...
you made a very serious mistake tonight, artar.
but i'm staying at black swan's guest house right now.
come and see me before i leave.
what did she give you?
i got a sip of the same ass, very different faces, and i got a sip of that when i realized it.
i'm not gonna let you take the name of your family, your family, your family, your last name, for bargaining with your flight moves and bargain.
as much as i want to deny you, our reputation depends on each other.
my wife, margherita was born to me last week.
my legal inheritance.
i wonder how long it takes to curse your last name.
you're a good man.
by the men who knew how to shoot.
that's what you did, leonardo.
today they're executed a jew.
she's absolutely attractive woman, but i prefer to throw that toothless witch over there.
please give me something to drink from the memory fountain.
depends what's inside.
history is a lie that has become a weapon by the people who have suppressed the truth.
in centuries, your story will be suppressed.
did you ever hear of a word, "nat like a river"?
that's the most unpredictable thing, that the river is circulation.
one's death would open the birth door to another's birth door.
i saw a man executed today.
please give me something to drink from the memory fountain.
this temple was a place of a temple that was used for a religious faith long before jesus.
we are known as the sons of mithra.
it's a time when a lot of you are called the process of reminding you of something forgotten again.
they've been showing some clues to the location of the book.
when the avamar yusuf caught and sent to death, he was following his clues.
maybe you've heard of the secrets the vatican's gathering.
he's a man named mr. lupuri.
i still don't understand what this has to do with me.
it was taken against constantine's will.
do you remember there was a incident in childhood?
i was a boy in vinc.
i was sent to pick up the lost cousin.
then what am i gonna do?
fate chose you, leonardo.
i don't believe in fate.
then believe yourself.
so where do i start looking?
from the deepness of the soul.
she already opened the door for you.
what about mom?
he'll be waiting for you on the other side.
all you have to do is go through the door.
master!
we've been looking for you since last night.
this place has been empty for centuries, leo.
master was looking for you at night guard.
they told me that lorenzo media wanted you personally.
leonardo sergeo piero...
they said it was the bastard's son.
and the problem was that you said you were quite unimaginable, arrogant, arrogant, and your own ideas.
aribir means i exaggerate my own value.
my office lucrezia seems to think that you're capable of something that isn't in my p.r. image.
he insisted that his beauty was only in your picture.
must be pretty careful then.
a character vomiting.
you must be smart enough to finish this.
it's the last thing i'm afraid of when it's mrs donati.
then i'll tell your father to prepare a contract.
i've got some designs i think you might interest you.
this will increase the firearm of your balls at great rate.
when the next part is fired, it's gonna be filled with parts under it, and it's gonna get cold under it.
and the balls are on a air-quel together-
it's gonna be two men inside.
they're gonna control the manivel, which is how they're gonna get the wheel back.
the balls could be planted around the car.
it's a flight machine.
it's taken model of the bread wings of a bat.
they were born with wings, yes.
i believe that people can fly, and i believe that god has blessed us with the brains that can imagine.
anything that can be imagined can finally be done.
whoever says otherwise is a fool.
what exactly do you suggest?
i hope to be hired as an army engineer.
i'm a helicist, too.
i have nothing to do with war.
rome too.
the two states that need to be made with other states.
sforza's death was the end of the game throne.
you need your own weapons, sir.
i'll give you a humble salary.
to see what these things are and what they're not meant to be, they can actually be done.
shall we say 000 florence then?
i'll cut your tongue if you negotiate more.
as you say, sir.
thank you.
you used lucrezia to get to me, didn't you?
i could use anything i could to reach my target.
smart but i suggest you don't act very smart around me.
is something wrong?
no, sir.
florence doesn't have secrets.
how did you become a devil this time?
he played with a woman's pride.
then back to work.
we have a colombina to do it!
i want you to take out the jew's body.
i have to go.
would i be useful?
your body is tied up for the taze.
i'll get to work then.
his parents are coming on monday.
he's with the intricate franco and the old man, old jacobo.
about us.
that's why they've been made at the first time in the board.
colomina's about to fly.
all of you, welcome to god's house.
your anka's flames suited to you.
tell me the truth, are you always so desperate for who you're sleeping with?
you're not a prostitute, ma'am.
there's no way we're moving this game any further, mrs donati.
i knew it was you from the first moment you came to me.
how did you know?
i scratched you.
your faces, your trial, your move.
more attractive question is why a noble woman would risk her reputation for an unattended art.
isn't that what the festival's about?
then tell me what it is.
you knew i'd call you.
lorenzo liked your design.
can i see some of your miracles?
what is this?
it's a tool to slow someone down the fall rate.
what conditions can i use that for?
let's say you're trapped in a castle.
you can take that up and be safe and safe in the air.
thank god.
lorenzo's interest in you is obviously right.
you risk more.
maybe your life.
and what are you up to my reckless attitude?
i'm forbidden and think you're destiny too.
you're the third person who told me something about fate this week.
maybe you just started hearing things called you.
now...
fuck me again, leonardo.
this time, remember, you're not the only one who can do a manipation.
we can't let you through the front door for certain reasons.
how rude.
i promised to pay first.
i accept your satisfaction?
then start talking.
there's a new player on the stage.
leonardo's a known art known as vinc.
the psychic took him to work to make the around-arms.
artis are family clowns.
i didn't know why this story would concern us.
this art is different.
my spy in florence.
if i'm not mistaken, you're the lupo mercuri.
it's the head of the sec.
well, it looks like you got a new champion.
keep watching him.
see if he's cooperating.
what if he's not?
then it will burn in hell.
with the other enemies of god.
don't make it hard.
yeah, you too.
in a good defense, you have to be on the line of the attack.
when the bad guy comes on you, you cross the line and make a new line.
until he's old and dead, or did you try to save me?
angel, i didn't ask you to punch me a hole teacher.
i want to learn to fight.
you don't believe i'm gonna do this.
men aren't always around to protect women.
besides, what if you were the man i had to fight?
could be that.
okay.
force him to fight him against him and he'll raise his speed.
cordelia, using a deadly weapon is a little different than a pyon.
ready!!!!!!!
ok!
you're on the team.
lilah.
i was friends with billy.
thank you very much, gavin.
i'll take it from here.
he felt trapped.
gavin, why don't you go and be busy with the deals?
you don't want to wake up in such a horrible place again, do you?
nobody wants that.
congressman.
i hope you stay out of trouble this time.
let's go home.
this is the second time you brought our nephew back to us.
it was our pleasure.
"happy for us" means he has nothing to do with it.
good boy.
by the way, get out.
why don't you keep trying to listen to me for once instead of shutting that big mouth open?
you weren't the captain of the liazara team, were you?
at least lindsey...
the attempt you showed angel to train you, the responsibility you took.
i'm proud of you.
never hurts to be ready.
if you think you can help you fight, why not?
i was kidding.
wesley, if you want to get to know fred any closer, maybe next time, you'll have a chance to ask that you don't want us to come over for dinner.
i mean...
is it that obvious?
i don't think others noticed.
still, the last thing any of us should do is to be a couple with each other.
their office, even under normal circumstances...
we don't live under normal circumstances.
what are the chances that we can find someone outside who can deal with things we have to deal with?
i don't know, maybe we should think...
with each other?
actually, i was gonna say to be alone.
wesley, tell her if you like her.
this murder was committed a week ago.
why are they showing this to me now?
how did you get these?
did the police sell this to you?
usually if the victim is important, they sell them.
he said she didn't listen to him.
he was trying to keep her quiet.
it worked.
00 minutes before the crime was committed, look who was there.
what? what?????
okay, he's nice.
who is it?
are you sure it's him?
when you take someone from hell size, you remember her face.
yeah, that's him.
now we know why the powers show me the death of the woman.
she died because of me.
angel, if that's a responsibility, then so am i.
angel...
hey.
whatever happens now, you're not responsible, and i'm not.
but i know who you are.
you're a little nervous, lilah.
long day at the office.
my attention has been made.
i was gonna do this.
i know he has some of his powers not...
billy never touched me, and you can't touch him.
this family is the most important family in the country.
they have half the east coast.
the law doesn't do anything to them.
it's not like you cut off some monsters.
stay away from my client.
i don't think it would be good to steal the bell.
how would you like to dress up like a security guard to sneak in?
all right, you want to be next?
i think we wait here.
why didn't it surprise me that i could come in without an invitation?
as far as i know, you have an invitation.
i never hurt a woman my whole life.
i just like to watch.
you're coming back.
really?
you're looking for me.
we're taking you into custody for questioning.
sanchez, read her rights.
who are you?
nobody.
i'll tell you i have a woman who never listens to me.
yeah, to give up $00 million from the fortune and escape to a prison cell.
yeah, but for how long?
if it isn't a blazing hell fire burning into a hell of a well-protective demon size, then it wouldn't be simple for me to have a problem.
angel, what are you gonna do?
you can't just walk into a station like that and play the terrorist.
there was an accident.
he can tell her what billy did to her partner before he attacked her.
it's not a bad idea for one of us to stand by while we visit a patient in the hospital.
it's part of the blood in the car.
not human.
it came right here.
i'll take an example to the hotel, see what kind of creature billy is.
i'll take care of a foot job.
normal, day shoes.
cordelia.
i don't think you should do this.
how can i not?
i managed to take billy's blood sample.
maybe we can figure out which demon robbery he's got and how his power works.
can you pass me the glass plate?
thank you.
will you invite me in?
please, come in.
i want you to tell me about billy.
tell angel everything you didn't tell her.
what makes you think i'd do that?
first of all, your face.
i'll know as soon as i'm re-educated.
i don't change sides.
angel feels responsible for this boy because he brought him back from hell.
i feel responsible, too, because he did it to save me.
you don't really feel anything about this because you're a foolish bitch.
it's been expanding.
pink, it's not spring fashion.
billy blim is driving people crazy.
then why didn't he impress angel?
others can take hours.
god, i hope angel doesn't start feeling angry.
you really didn't.
i have to find billy.
and i help you, why?
do you remember the man you hired to get into my visions?
you know, what did it look like to me?
i'm cut, i'm cut, my face is broken, and i'm hurt in every second, or is it gonna get worse if it's gonna end up dead or worse until it's over?
this is about the pain.
there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop it.
she can be destroyed by someone else in a lifetime.
and a strong woman would never agree to wear the "naked bitch" cover.
where's billy?
i'm 00 years old, i understand why you did it.
is there a reason, am i right?
how many times do you want to talk to your client with punches?
surprised you?
she'd probably sit back and tell him how to drive the car.
you know these people.
he probably deserved it.
like i said...
dylan, your cousin's here.
hi, dylan.
billy.
i didn't know you were having a party.
i thought we agreed you weren't coming here anymore after the last thing.
you want me or me?
some of the suyes look like they're pretty powerful.
they're probably showing that billy came from the demonstration.
then the power of billy freaking people seems to be in her blood.
which means it could be through or spit or even touch.
speaking of spit, where's cordelia?
you knew that when you said "i got out" he was out because you talked to her.
well... i thought i...
if you lie to me again, there'll be a serious problem between us.
sit down, fred.
there's something we need to talk about.
i'm sorry i didn't say cordelia's gone.
we still have to make some changes around here.
change can be good, i think.
it's like you don't wear the provocative clothes anymore.
provocative?
maybe your parents never told you what men and your father went after grown men.
you can't come in here all the time, and you can't make a wave like this on
you force me to take it.
is that what you want?
stop it.
are we standing up now?
you put your hair back in the back, you blink your eyes, and then we turn around, you laugh at us.
you think you can do anything because you're tied to life and you're bleeding?
no.
i'll show you the blood.
what do you tell a woman with two purple eyes?
nothing you've already said twice.
no sense of humor.
to be honest, i'm calling to kill that bastard.
come in.
you need to know the rules about billy.
everyone in the family knows these rules.
don't leave your girlfriend with her alone, keep her pets away from her and never let her touch you.
put your money on the table and walk away.
can you explain something to me?
why did you invite me in after i told you i wanted to kill your cousin?
you're angel, right?
did billy talk about me?
angel said someone who's too emotional is going to be here late.
the mel hero is exaggerated...
fred.
i know what you're doing.
who you are.
you're pulling me.
you force me to find you.
it's like a cat-fat game.
you're fooling me with my girls' ways.
but you never give up, do you?
no, you keep laughing and running.
i guess, my love, i'm not one of the new kids.
i'm a man.
you can't come out, can you?
no, you hide.
you cheat.
and you, snake, you set a conspiracy behind us.
"my honey, eat this.
just an apple."."."
your problem is sex.
why are you doing this to me?
do i know you?
i thought we should meet.
i'm the woman wolfram and hart tortured to get you out of your cell.
i see.
poor, helpless, cruel woman, she needs to shoot out all of her rights to him.
no, asshole.
i'm here to send you back.
i mean, of course, you women are prostitutes who sell yourself for money and charge, but guys are that bad.
maybe even worse.
their career, their family, their family, their family, their lives, anything underneath the skirt.
i'm wearing pants.
in fact, i'm sorry i got an arrow that i've got a fiancée who's been reading to her witness.
and is it a coincidence i use a penis gun?
i don't.
you don't have the guts to do this.
you're wrong again.
he can't hurt me.
no, i'm not gonna hurt her.
i'll never hurt her.
here.
i can tell you that billy has blood on his handprint.
so the handprint on the fingerprint downstairs is billy's blood?
you're saying that i took my hand and looked at my hand, because of the handprint i was looking at, and wes maniac turned into a killer?
that worries me when you explain it like this.
i better get out of here.
lock the door behind me.
maybe we should follow plan b.
god.
you said we should follow plan b, but what's the plan?
plan...
plan...
plan b, if you don't stop making the bullshit...
god.
cordy, get out of here.
all that anger to get up to the surface, all the hate.
please go.
i can't.
that's my problem.
you think that's your problem?
you know what your real problem is?
men like this!
because your power doesn't impress me.
charles, you're scaring me.
take this and put me down.
you want me to hit you?
yes!! yes!! y
i can't.
you can.
hit me!
charles, please.
" charlesles, please." good.
you'll pay for this.
would you like to hear my theory, fred?
about how stupid you are.
after five years living in a cave, i believe that if she's out of the safe to escape, you're going to be in the dark, small shelters.
let's get this over with.
i'm sorry, wesley.
are you sorry?
you were right about me loving dark places to hide.
but you also forgot i like to grow things.
neither do i.
i mean, you're a man, but why didn't billy's touch impress you?
maybe it's because i'm not human.
and a vampire never turns into a monster.
you know that stuff billy made in other people?
it was always for pain and pleasure.
i think you could say the devil made you less important than people.
as noble as a man.
i mean, it's really uncomfortable to be capable of evil.
weird.
what?
i'm getting used to fighting outside and i'm getting comfortable.
i understand that.
wesley, it's me, fred.
are you hurt?
i left you a lot of messages.
i'm so sorry.
wesley, you have to get back to work.
how can you not come?
but it's time to come back.
fred.
something inside me was forced to face.
god, no.
it wasn't something inside of it, wesley.
it was something that happened to you.
i don't know what kind of man i am anymore.
i know.
you're a good man.
will i see you in the office again?
yeah.
good.
why risk everything to escape compassionable arms?
we're walking to rome tomorrow with crixus.
but i want you to go with spartacus.
are we gonna eat a bunny rabbit?
bring your torch here!
his orders are known for drowning.
and opera dolphin.
the son of gaeus ppeius magnus.
i thought pacey was hitting with the renegade harpus in the cain.
if the pacey's hunters return to the republic, he and his legions will leave their tracks.
let me know if you see any move around.
then we must support the ghost and make him see the flesh and light days.
was it always the end of it?
the days after we separate our ways were full of victory.
the paths of our enemy's blood were filled with dead, turning our blood into land.
did he live the same fate with crixus?
to show spartacus to live.
crassus is pushing your mind to fool you.
if i were only my own life, maybe i'd be trapped.
he was on his way south to the union to crassus' legions.
order them to leave camp at speed camp near the sky of aplo.
he was beaten by a prostitute named canthara, and was stabbed to the throat of his nun.
this offer made me very dreamy.
i don't know that pacey has a way to support a case that's unbearable.
if i had a desire like this, why didn't he thank him?
i won't risk going to your commander's camp.
i'm not leaving my duty to say hi in front of a imaginary titan.
you can't really think of accepting this offer.
pacey wants to know what you know about spartacus to steal from the person who deserves victory.
and when the time comes, we can avenge the heart of the wounded.
let's get back to ourselves with the live hot skin.
and to console them of the time of death.
the blood of every blood roman blood will be taken from us!
i'm here with me now, professor charles epipes is often a mathist consultant for the fbi.
are you here to help fbi find bonnie parks?
for example, we know mrs. parker's car was found in san marino avm.
yeah, i calculated 00 dry and people who would come after him for revenge.
yes, that's true, but every suspect was a completely different impulse.
you know, there's a circus game where you're either gonna fill the balloon or you're gonna squeeze your clown's mouth
the asimetrik threatening every suspect in every suspect with a suspect, it's like a clown's mouth-sucking video game.
we need to find out what the suspect feeding to the point where the suspect's gonna detonate the explosion.
especially those who are afraid of him, who fear him.
filter pump has been sounding pretty loud lately.
hi, charlie.
your father told me about the after class the other day, i volunteer.
make your way out long, do your planet a favor.
it's a closed box during research.
he used to work by himself.
i was in the same bed in afghanistan with some of them.
he doesn't trust his security.
i'll go myself.
the lab team solved the notes we found in the woman's office.
your wife, ex-wife, an angry boyfriend.
okay, i'm on my way now.
charlie, who would have tried to do that to you?
because you were already pissed about my interview.
nothing should change what happened.
it was december.
can we talk about this in the room?
helal.
and you know you've been making a lot of sacrifices to make her something big.
i started this at my 00 o'clock waving.
it makes taylor look like a big hero who's gonna buy a rotten center to the rotten field.
he's been forced to leave their houses for the website, and he's usually talking to the poor people that taylor's wives scared of.
i'm still working on it.
that's the problem i need to analyze the trouble analysis of what i'm analyzing and not knowing what i'm doing.
i told your father i'd make a shot.
how cute is it to see the power countdown comes back?
right?
i don't know how long that'll last.
you're brave or too brave or too small.
sonny layva is in my hand.
when i find bonnie, she'll mark sonny.
there's no way sonny could have kidnapped him alone.
when i was held on that burden ship, there was something that made me stick to my lips while they handcuffed me.
and he knew my team would come for me.
no matter how bad things were, you, david, megan, and megan, you were working my freezer, and you were going through that door.
because i've been through the same thing the first time i've seen a war in afghanistan.
yeah, they're, uh, ten-hole property numbers, meter numbers, phone numbers, and they're all so hidden.
if you pull off the force, if you pull off the force down, it's going to pull them down into a big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big
at the same time, the neighbors help lift the prank.
it was the power to sink the whole shaman line into the water.
he'd win millions by buying those property.
millions, probably.
nothing.
yeah.
it's nothing but a personal blood case.
it's not just about walls and roofs.
and the whole master of all that was the same faith that the soul of beauty and charm was the same.
right behind you.
i mean, do you think i'm tied to you?
you know, better.
what exactly do you do?
nobody loves the french.
we've lost contact with our discoveries.
but based on the analysis of the disease's yima analysis, we know that this mic is where it began.
we don't know that without an example.
if there are survivors on their special forces match, they will find survivors, and you will take a blood sample from the dead elders, but at 0000 hours before all missiles are destroyed.
i don't have to tell you what's gonna happen if minutes get the story.
what's that smell?
we did it.
the living dead have been disarmed.
mom!
megan.
you can't fly, baby.
mom!
mr. edick.
what are you doing here?
we need to talk, janet.
can't we do another time?
interested in my daughter...
you're not answering my calls.
that's why i came to see you.
no flying.
how can you find me in the middle of san francisco and not find my husband?
your husband doesn't want to be found.
i told you that.
yeah, i told you i'd give you all i could.
that's not how it works, janet.
maybe that's because my husband paid you for not walking like that.
understand?
yeah.
megan?
megan?
megan?
megan?
megan, answer!
mom?
mom?
mom?
megan.
megan?
hello?
please!
please.
i just want to see my little girl.
please.
please.
at least tell me if you're okay.
no nails.
help!
somebody help me!
please.
can you hear me?
i know you're there.
okay.
get away!
control yourself!
i won't hurt you.
i came to help.
who are you?
my name is joe.
okay?
i'm not one of them.
i don't know.
i woke up five minutes ago.
how did you get out of your room?
there was a key.
don't you have the key?
calm down.
do you know why you're here?
why would somebody do that?
i owed some people.
how much?
about $0,000.
this looks like it's not worth the trouble.
anyone else?
my husband.
what does your husband want from me?
where are we?
i don't know.
what's the last thing you remember?
i was parked and...
where?
in san francisco.
i was in new york.
let me see.
i'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
suck your blood.
i think i heard other people's voice.
yeah, me too.
we have to find them.

what's wrong?
what if people are kidnapping us?
what does it matter?
we let them go.
of course i can let you go.
hello?
can anyone hear me?
anyone?
listen up!
what is this place?
for god's sake let me out!
listen to me.
okay, there's a bible in the password.
a key inside the bible.
look at the bible in the drawer next to your bed.
charlie morse.
capital investors.
i'm joe.
it's not over.
if they want money, i have it.
we're still trying to figure out who they are.
help?
didn't i hear the wake-up call?
slow, slow!
calm down, soldier.
we're on your side.
are you being held hostage?
yeah.
we're all hostages.
it's okay.
i didn't think i'd drink that much.
are you okay?
i think i've had a record of my standard.
do you know where she is?
do you know what it is?
i think i should make a phone call.
come.
where are the people who took us?
i won't wait to find out.
it's not working.
why don't they come and get us?
i don't understand.
it's contagious!
you must waste your power.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
i just...
my wife.
if i don't look at her... she...
i don't even want to think what's gonna happen
smoke detector.
if alarm works, the magnets can shut down.
what do you say?
i'm saying if we could light a fire, maybe we could get out of here.
but if the doors aren't open, we're stuck here.
anybody got a match?
break as little as you can.
in a spark.
this is bullshit.
i want him to be thrown and thrown in the throat of a arrow.
renbe, i can't wait to find out.
i need more confirmation.
is that who i guess?
better.
you see this?
a man lost in a play park yesterday.
something small enough that won't interest us.
it was a mother they kidnapped.
they didn't touch the kid.
a mother leaving her child.
no, a lonely mother.
a good mother.
he was at the kids' house.
that sounds...
if that's gonna happen, it could've been in san francisco.
i got a picture.
of course you did.
i'm not talking with assumption, kat.
cops don't ignore evidence like they used to.
security camera caught everything.
internet networks can't take this for a couple more hours.
it's out.
it's not clear.
it's a promising thing.
anybody ask about her?
she has her mother but...
you're looking at me.
i'm looking at you.
your mom's gonna have a dead body bag, mark.
you know that.
give me your trauma first.
then you can look at the missing mom thing.
i can't see anything.
everybody think.
what was the last thing you remember?
last night, i went to sleep like it was every night, and then i woke up here.
who could have done this?
what's worth?
worth?
i'm having a hard-on for a student unit.
i make $00,000 a year.
i've got $00,000 in retirement.
you soldier?
the army doesn't pay much, sir.
what about you?
i have no value but myself.
maybe, maybe not.
why do you think they took you?
i'd rather not.
what do you do?
no offense, but i don't know who you are.
we're sitting here thinking about where the bad guys are.
how do we know the bad guys aren't here?
he's right.
one of us could be one of them.
but there's only one joe we don't know anything about.
everyone has value in someone's eyes.
i don't have money, i don't have a family.
i have no value in anyone's eyes.
maybe because of your life insurance.
no.
that's the only reason i know how to miss someone.
not for everyone.
right, sergeant?
are you saying someone's gonna cut our heads off?
it's hard to do it if we move.
come on, come on.
there you go.
somebody get that table over there.
here.
come on.
move!
move!
are you coming?
what is this?
a hotel.
chinese?
someone's here.
anyone?
cut.
hello?
all mistakes are cut.
i don't understand.
no sheriff at the sheriff's office?
i wonder who's watching us.
i wish they'd come and get us.
this is much worse.
we have a few hours before dark.
shall we walk?
until someone stops us.
is this a loaded locker?
nobody move!
what? what?????
what do you want us to do?
get down, okay?
do what he says.
get down!
okay, which one of you is in charge?
you don't have enough?
you're not one of them, are you?
so you're not one of them.
i don't even know who they are, okay?
listen.
we've been kidnapped like you.
i don't know about that.
get down, okay?
i won't say it again!
if you want to shoot me, go ahead.
i have nothing to lose.
okay?
get the gun!
get the gun!
get the gun!
keep her on the ground.
okay, okay.
i won't stop bothering with some answers.
what's your name?
how do we get out of here?
i don't know.
red lights, whatever.
i woke up in that hotel across the street.
it was you.
i heard you passed through my room.
did you ask for help?
so you're saying you left him then?
look, no offense.
enough.
so what do we do with him?
does it matter?
it could be one of them.
okay.
who's coming with me?
me.
what else?
we don't know what's out there.
i mean, stay here?
i'm just saying we have to be cautious.
let's wait until dark.
then i'll take the rifle and find out.
what if you get caught in the dark?
i'm taking that risk.
that's your job, isn't it?
but then you'll be dead by the only rifle we have.
if that's what you think...
i don't expect the darkness.
i'm going home right now.
you can stay here and keep an eye on the others.
who gave that enough?
you did.
if i don't get back by tomorrow, you'll have to explore it.
i'll get help.
no, no.
please don't go.
i have to.
you in the army, joe?
me?
are you kidding?
where did you get such an idea?
what you said.
the things you know about that soldier's story.
what business is that?
janet, perhaps your daughter is very good.
my daughter's 0 years old, okay?
he's allergic, and he's got a special perh.
well, what if something happens here...
okay, but if anything happens to you, you have family, right?
i mean, your life doesn't seem to wait.
who's waiting for you at home?
exactly.
there's no one to wait.
joe?
joe, can you hear me?
what happened?
wait a minute!
we can't leave them to die.
we don't leave anyone behind, but there's a way to do it, there's a tired one.
okay.
okay.
do you think they got shot?
i didn't hear anything.
i don't see blood.
it's supposed to be a lot of blood.
i'm coming.
if i'm to be shot, you need to find out where it was fired.
okay.
mcirna!
which clearly doesn't work.
we have to go back.
get in!
get in!
let's go inside.
do you remember the last time you saw your daughter?
not recently.
we were both very busy.
he had a babysitting thing, and i...
to be honest, i wasn't talking to my daughter.
the truth is, she wasn't talking to me.
she took me out of her life until recently.
i never even met her husband.
she thought megan should know her mother.
he never thought i was a good parents.
he said i was bad.
but i never hit him.
once.
i hit it with a hairbrush until it broke.
my daughter and i...
we both understand it's very powerful.
i found this in your room.
no.
no, it's not mine.
then who is it?
thank you, grandma.
i look forward to her coming home to my mom to show it to my mom.
yes, i'm sure he'll be delighted.
now get your baby upstairs and play with her.
i need to talk to mr. renbe.
come on.
come on.
if there's a good side of this, it's not a second chance i won.
it's a chance to be a good parents i can't be told.
yeah, that's definitely a blessing.
thank you for your time, ma'am.
don't worry about your daughter.
i'm sure you'll be back soon.
i'm sure it's all going to end well.
super duke is empty.
what about the others?
they're still lying there.
someone like that.
yeah, it could be anyone.
you've got to be kidding.
oh, my god.
okay.
okay.

i blinked, then i woke up in that van.
it was like...
have you ever used demerol?
do what i say.
you heard me.
take off your shirt.
come on.

you heard me.
do what i say.
if it's been drugged, it's got to be a trace.
take off your pants.
hey, moira.
how about you and joe go into a room together?
yeah.

what if they took her?
what if my daughter's in a place like this?
don't think that.
you don't understand.
i wish they'd kidnapped her too.
at least i knew you were safe.
thank you.
you have to make the decision.
"you're single."
no one else...
"your decision's a little over."
"you'll win a big reward."
"you help someone else, you help yourself."

we had a really long, weird day.
at your service, sir.
what would you like to know...
where are we?
i'm afraid i don't know.
that's not an answer.
okay, charlie.
where did you come from?
behind the hotel.
i think he meant before.
a man called and said i'd start work the next day.
isn't that weird for you?
i've agreed.
take a good look.
look closer, ladies and gentlemen.
i used to.

and look at it now.
now look.
it may look impossible, it's me.
it's me, ladies and gentlemen!
and you ask yourself, how did he do it?

fucking fraud.
i'm not treating people who want to lose weight, treating people who want to find the reason for obesity.
it's the only way to lose weight and stay away from him.
i won't put you in diet.
eat whatever you want.
no more of that, no disappointment.
before you hurry, with your own steps, you must find your own way.
he's dating a key plan so we can help each other.
we're gonna ask each other questions and we're gonna look for answers in ourselves.
in short, we'll expose ourselves.
let's get started.
i want you all to stand up and take off your clothes.
no one is ashamed.
then you better leave.
honey, come on.
let's go.
i like being fat and naked.
it's like you're a mono model...
honey, please, let's go.
it's a scann...

i'm not fat, i'm too much.
i locked 00 pounds four months ago.
then i started to get weight.

a little diet and exercise and they disappear.
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0... 00... 00... 00...
it always works.

i've had a sleep-daking problem since i was ten years old, so i think it's time to do something, especially in the day.
me too.
i use sleeping pills because i start eating if i wake up at night.
sofia, what are you doing?
what? what?????
you have to go and let her stay.
you're not even fat.

we should make a sound as soon as it's loud.
wait, don't tire yourself.
no, i want to finish!
i don't have sex with myself.
i'll do all the work, you can rest.
apple.
how's the new group?
did you take your clothes off?
you said you wouldn't.
yeah, but i did my talking and i kept going...
and now you want to fuck it.
well, up.
i don't know about you, but i'm going back.
i think we should talk about it to the community.
if you already know, that's the answer.
and your family should give you a clue not to mention it.
alex, i'm tired of this.
you're a rebel, sofi.
we haven't seen each other naked yet.
time.
when, on our wedding night?
what if you suddenly don't like me?
we saw each other in salou last summer.
it's not the same.
same thing.
then let's do it now.
yeah.
your family will be here soon.
then we better hurry.
let me open this button.
come on.
what am i supposed to say to give you up?
i'll do it anyway.
you never listen to me.
sofia, no...
i don't understand anything.
you're starting to worry about your physical looks.

contact problem
this is the story of how my partner screwed up in my life.
don't think, do what i say!
because you're a fucking asshole.
you're a fucking pain in the ass!
a sew!
idiot!
where are you going?
my pictures came out in a couple of magazine, on tv... and sold out.
it'll cost you 0,000 euros all night.
0000 uero???
i'll show you what's precious.
how about a signed poster?
i've seen more pictures of me in the magazine, and i've just fattened, and i'm more worried.
and more and more...
that's enough, my partner sued me, and he froze all of my accounts as a pretender.
are the pills working?
they can't impress your soul.
it's not my fault you're fat, asshole!
they're against the need of day energy.
and the others?
how does being fat make you feel about your job?
i knew a new perfume brand in a mall.
but if you can see i'd been selling poison instead of my perfume...
sofia, how can i help you?
now i work in a big company phone market.
sofia, how can i help you?
i'm too fat to chase the bad guys, so i'm looking at dead men.
one night i've always wanted to go to a expensive restaurant, and i've been investigating a body in the c.a.
he stuck in his ring and died choking.
the waiter heson heimch appreciated it, but the ring was long gone.
there was a letter i couldn't read in the ring.
i was curious and... licked the ring and cleaned it.
i did it without thinking.
referee.
the problem is, i like it.
it tasted fresh oysters and the gallery wine.
i was wondering, what was it saying?
"i'll even love you at the barn."
it's okay.
how does being fat make you feel about your job?
i work at home, so it doesn't impress.
i'm writing internet pottotions and systems code.
let me get this straight.
my boyfriend is an engineer.
we'd go to the gym together, we'd go healthy food, we'd be together in the morning...
i don't know this situation, and i won't tell her.
a telecromatist without webem?
i didn't want to take one.
why don't you tell her and get rid of her?
how about you help me lose 00 pounds?
when's he coming back?
in six months.
don't worry, if he's in america, he'll be fat like a pig.
is it working?
no, wait a minute.
then i'll take you on a private exam.
then you went to her?
no, i didn't.
maybe you should go.
it's not just about saving ourselves.
to save others, or at least try to try.
i'll go if i have to.
you don't trust alex?
but i don't like her looking at naked beautiful women.
maybe that's why he doesn't want to see me naked.
sofia, please...
there are better ways to get to know each other.
why is everything about sex bad or wrong?
you just have to wait for the right reason and the right place.
speaking of which, why don't you tell them about the scan you've joined them.
they do strange things.
come on!
it's always the same.
hey, show me some team spirit.
00 to 00 blue team.
come on, you sleep there!
yeah, let it go!
no good feed.
i don't agree.
good.
samuel, you have the service.
come on, get that fat ass over here!
luis, one more joke and i'll let you out of this class.
let's go!
you fat.
i'd hit you, but i don't want my hands to be a pig fat.
over here, come on.
when you're bored?
under stress?
when you're satisfied?
i mean, all day.
one cupcake, two cupcakes, then chocolate, one more cup of cake, and then one afternoon, dinner, dessert, first dinner, and the second chocolate.
isn't that what everyone expected from me?
"look, fat again."
guilty.
i've found an effective metod to deal with this.
don't share.
so you're telling people around you fat.
no, not like...
to you, to me.
come on, honey, eat up.
this is your birthday cake.
it's rutinini.
you sick fuck!
you two aren't really murderers today.
present time.
this is for you, and this is for you.
a laptop...
what is this thing?
it's an autopilot to analyze dna results.
you can be like my father.
it was broken, so i fixed it for you.
so stupid!
don't be so ungrateful.
we bought you this because we knew you wouldn't love her.
you put the electromagnetic on your body, and the stark zones are bothering.
it'd be nice if the zillion had one electromagnetic.
cell phone!
she has a camera and everything, you won't disturb her sister anymore.
megapixel's higher than yours, big ass.
eat, honey.
then use your shape-shifter and it's done.

i'm getting on a plane.
where?
teo, teo!
teo, come here!
teo!o!o!o!
teo, come!
teo!o!o!o!

one, two... and three.
what?
latin bed.
my mother's gift.
this isn't a bed.
no, look.
you're putting two together with this zipper.
yeah, you don't know that... or your mom.
don't start with my mom again.
you really...
you want somebody else?
that's pretty comfortable.
and we'll fit in a meter.
you didn't get excited at sexx shop, did you?
no.
you're my only love.
i'm scared.
why?
you can bother me.
that doesn't mean anything.
it means i love you more than anything.
i'm ugly, fat and disgusting.
i don't believe you, you...
how can i prove it?
you're not touching me.
touching.
what am i doing now?
it's not touching.
but it is!
it's not touching, alex.
it's touching.
and he said, and i said, and i said:
it's happiness,
chapter 00 chapter 00 chapter 00 chapter 00
right, right reason, and the right place.
don't video me!
run, fat, run.
go on.
what do you want?
you don't have to sue me for that.
i've never seen you run before this case is sued.
it's clear you need a little push.
you're an asshole and you'll never hurt me.
then get lost, slug.
i sold your roof floor.
you sold my roof floor?
you have one week to move.
son of a bitch!
i'm not moving, you understand?
what are you doing?
don't try to fake me.
get up, there are people around.
jesus...
help!
help...
are you relaxed now?
well, yeah, i don't know.
shall we do it again?
sin is already done.
right.
maybe you'll just hang in there this time.
we need protection for this.
it's in the bedroom.
it won't.
alex...
that's not what i mean.
if we do this, we face the consequences.
okay.
you had a little anjin.
you just panicked.
what about the other guy?
you know him?
my partner.
he's got a violent trauma in his skull.
it triggered the anvriet and the violent heart.
we're going to keep her in balance, but she's probably damaged her brain.
enrique...
oh, jesus!
jesus!
what happened to her, enrique?
i die!
what did they do to her?
do it now.
be brave enough to do that.
i know you're going to leave me.
because i'm fat.
because you won't want to be with someone as fat as me.
because you always hated fat people.
that's why i want you to leave me now.
don't touch me.
stop.
stop!
i haven't left the house for the past six months.
all i do is work and eat.
i have no life without german.
i can't do anything without him.
you can't spend your whole life with a man.
i didn't try things differently, i didn't experience.
i feel like i've been missing the opportunity for 00 years.
i was fat because i wanted her to leave me.
leave me, leave me, let go!
i went running and my partner came to cheer me up.
i suddenly heard a sound and a man was fighting my partner.
i thought you robbed her.
he pushed him and ran away.
i tried to call for help, but... obviously my heart couldn't stand it.
did you see the guy who robbed him?
no.
it was so dark.
did your partner have any problems?
no.
last question.
you're that kiloaway man, right?
use weight!
use weight!
use weight!
use weight!
weight!
weight!
weight!
look at yourselves, please.
in your privacy, in front of the mirror.

stop feeling bad.
forget my way, kiloaway pills.
step three.
my name's number one, my name
it doesn't matter how you feel, how you feel.
identify yourself with a word.
light.
happy.
awful.
let's see if your feelings are connected to your weight.
00 pounds light.
i beat the priest.
looks like the only person who's had feelings connected to her lost weight is sofia.
why do you think you lost weight?
i don't know, i've been more active in the last few months.
i've got an purpose, and i've got a motive.
but i guess it's actually kind of like me being more satisfactory than i am.
more.
i've set the water cold, it's good for your heart.
you can't believe the spray they ripped off for the rampa.
we must support each other in this life.
i put your clothes in the closet.
i was tired of seeing them shitty around.
disaster!
i'll be right back.
what is this?
i checked all the exams myself.
i can't believe it either.
what happened?
eat, big ass!
i'm less than one lesson than you!
asshole.
you haven't learned one lesson in one.
this teacher must really love you.
paula, what's wrong?
i don't fit my pants.
why are you wearing them if you know they won't be for you?
they were before, and i wanted to look good for you.
you look great.
i'm gonna break this damn mirror.
all day looking at yourself...
look at my tits, huge!
good.
you don't like big tits.
don't lie to me.
i'm so scared.
listen to me for a second.
paula, i'm not tired of you.
you're tired of yourself.
how many months pregnant women have you seen better than that?
all of them.
they all tell me how great the pregnancy is.
that's not what i expected.
you can't go on like this.
it's mean.
i know.
you didn't invite anyone?
put on something.
i told my parents i wanted to take private lessons from you.
or i can't stand being at school.
i can't stand being anywhere.
you're the only one who's been nice to me and has bigger belly than i am.
you can't move, can you?
i can do your shopping, make you friends, make some cleaning...
you want a shelter?
a little.
take off your homework.
how's her new training teacher?
a fool.
he keeps running us down.
but i'm just walking like i did you.
i'm holding it under hand in case my sugar fell.
in case your sugar falls?
give me that.
open the book.
candy.
open the book.
is it fixed?
yeah, all right.
if it breaks again, i'll break it in your head.
now cabin one, erika...
era...
hey, honey.
how was work?
good.
he was looking at his ass.
who, carlos?
i'm so excited!
i don't find it funny.
you're jealous.
no.
do you think that's right?
would you like me to look at the other girls?
you didn't like it, did you?
i don't think it's funny.
because i'm not okay.
all i think about is having sex with you.
and again.
i see you dress like this and...
in the meantime, we can come home.
did they bring another furniture?
we're sex addict.
no, we're an addict.
bat...
we have to get to bed.
i can't sleep, i'm scared.
well, i should go out and find a new apartment.
find someone to stay and take care of you.
pilot!
the doctor said i'm good enough to continue my normal life.
what?
you're my partner's wife.
we can't play happy couple.
fine, but you're gay.
nothing.
besides, we were friends before we met jesus.
remember when we slept together in college together?
awful!
i was sure i was gay that day.
jesus hasn't been with me in 00 months.
i think he was a little gay.
pilar, no.
i'm short.
close your eyes and think i'm a man.
no!
it's like one of those sexy kids you fucking 000 euros.
let's see what happens.
use some teeth.
this, kindly, careful, careful...
until i get down and have a blowjob.
you've been a heroekon?
how?
it's a blowjob.
you'll enjoy this experience as much as i enjoy my pleasure.
what about him?
did you do something to her?
like what?
like what she did to you.
no, gross!
i have a question, mr. therapist.
it's a little unusual for you to talk about personal matters at the bar, isn't it?
a beer in a therapy can make things that don't come out of its own way.
like your straight relationship.
sister's really bothering me.
he's always talking about happy and cakes and one more cupcake and another one more cake and another...
painful!
i think i just saw leonor leave.
i swear it was him.
another one!
what happened to the greedy manager?
i don't know.
one day he came into the wrong group.
i'm sorry, i think i came at the wrong time.
not the wrong time, wrong day.
and he never came back.
i called, but he didn't answer.
then he sent a message saying he left.
potato chips?
take one.
what was our deal?
i suggest potato chips.
if he gets it, i'll get it.
i feel guilty when i eat alone.
you told us to stop blaming ourselves.
giving up is something else to burden someone else's back.
give me that fucking jeep!
no more guilt.
feel better?
much better.
how much more pizza do we have?
all i can get is a cold pizza.
"i'm a stuck fat, whatever i want, hiding your own excuse."
i don't want to listen to this anymore, you understand?
your excuse is ready.
yes, it is.
what is this?
source tickets to your school trip.
you never sold.
i'm not going to the party, nor the trip.
is samuel leaving?
i don't think.
shame, it looks good.
come on, like dad said.
one for you, one for me and everyone's happy.
okay.
you're right, only the fatest kid in the class can like me.
fat couple, how nice.
"how do you like her?"
it's a rude, ridicul, ridiculous, unwitful...
great.
you send him a message, you can eat a slice.
i don't have a three or no deal.
i'll get the candies in your purse and your purse.
i don't have sugar in my bag.
okay, okay.
not the big one, take the little one.
you don't?
i don't eat snacks.
you never mentioned her.
he learns spanish and become a good christian.
he's gonna sing us a religious song from his country.
okay?
come on, champ.
i'm calling my friend sofia.
so she marry me.
how cute.
imagine us walking down the corridor with this music.
no, we're going to have a arguable koro.
koro can do the good music.
if you don't let me get my balls, you can forget this music.
tarzan.
pussy.
okay, therapist.
are you sure you don't wanna close your eyes and leave yourself in the flow?
no, it's not ethical because i'm your therapist.
goodbye then.
can i get another beer?
you brought your boyfriend.
he's not my boyfriend, he's thirty.
he told me he was crazy about you.
i just talked to her, she said you're great.
i hate alcohol.
relax, you'll get a job.
come!
i hate alcohol, too.
hi.
pilar, what are you doing here?
the pills don't work without you.
you don't belong here.
why?
i can help you, idiot.
there's a few more busy ways.
don't pay.
why would you pay for sex?
you can't have someone who really loves you.
i don't want to love anyone, you understand?
for not finding the right person.
i'm not the right person for anyone, pilar.
come on.
i'm gay, okay?
i like men, don't you understand?
go away!
go!
why?
i can't hear you.
i pretended to remember when you came home late, and you still fucked me?
yeah, i remember.
i spoke to my gynecologist today.
you know, normal life.
okay.
i'll do something tomorrow.
relax, i'll be right in.
you want me to fall asleep.
i want you to come to bed with me.
and i'm telling you i'm gonna clean up first.
paula?
don't your parents help you deal with your sister?
mine only think about themselves and their perfect marriage.
all they do is fuck all day.
good!
you have to learn to protect yourself.
i found some unpleasant rat poison on the internet.
paula, if he's staying, i'll sleep on the couch.
you'll sleep on any couch.
come on, pick it up.
you...
come on.
and me.
it tastes good, doesn't it?
i felt different as a kid.
i didn't like playing football or anything like that.
because if you are fat and lonely, no one asks why you don't behave like the others.
no one would have noticed i was gay.
but i didn't turn myself in to my confusion until the 00 specials in my 00th.
they let me volunteer, miraclely,
and they gave me to the swimers.
there was an incredibly handsome australia, which was very handsome to me to keep her out of the pool because they had no legs there.
i don't know which one's happy me yet, when you get the tan medals, the wheelchair will smile in your wheelchair, or wait for my office.
my first joke was a block.
i'm tired of being gay.
really.
emotion, happy, full life, expecting us to be lovely.
priority of humanity.
and that's not me.
i can't wait all night for muzice.
go.
you have to pay in any way.
i'm a con man.
i'm the worst faggot of all time.
i'm a lying, bad, cruel breeze.
i'm a contrary.
it doesn't have to be evil.
they can always explain something we're not ready to face.
that's why it's better not to escape them, face them and see where they take us.
because a lot of contaminated answers make their answers.
hands on your stomach.
close your eyes.
let's all breathe together.
take a...
breathe, breathe.
i thought it was my pregnancy and it was me.
we all have contaminants.
they're the first steps in our lives to understand what we want or what we don't want in our lives.
the one who deactivated you?
i broke the machine to get back there.
i broke it.
the one you worship?
the one you pressed but set you free?
the one who made you free, but jumped?
you're the one who's nipping you but loved you?
what is it you refuse, but what do you like?
you do it because you want to, or do you keep pretending everything's okay?
society wants you to be fat.
if you fat people feel better because they feel better.
not anymore.
now it's time to take my first step.
put your life on your knees.
one move can change the dynamite.
but a diary isn't enough for a bottle of kilo-away.
kilo-away doesn't create miracles.
it gives you the support you need in the long and hard way of your success.
believe me, there's only one way to success.
step two.
white, pure and clear.
00 pounds light.
it's almost dark shit color.
00 pounds light.
once again, i beat the festival priest.
shall we choose a smashing flower or a astronaut or an amazon, an amazon, living in a tropon?
i don't like big tits.
let's see.
it's louder.
it's not exactly pathological, but you have to be careful.
you can be a bunch of pins.
your blood pressure's up.
after what you said, it's not weird.
don't worry, paula.
it's gonna be okay.
just watch what you eat.
if you hadn't always been with that girl...
what?
nothing.
what are you doing, bigger?
you can use blood, fingernails, flesh, flesh and body.
to separate the dna, the proteteteteteteteteteteolics and the break-ups are a sample of the exemplary.
years ago, this process took weeks.
this machine can be done in less than 00 hours today.
i mean half your note.
we're a couple of eggs twins, so the last three houses... and these... they have to match.
i wasn't closed inside.
i even had a lovely boyfriend.
the thing is, it wasn't from the community.
i tried to get him into the community, but it wasn't about spiritual things.
i mean, he didn't want to be a virgin until he was married.
she got tired of waiting and she dumped me.
i was depressed, but alex came along.
actually, alex was always there.
two eggs, fries, rice, shrimp noodles and moo shu pork.
do you have fries?
a egg.
i want a salad salad salad with the beans.
when i started dating alex, i got really fat.
i can still study another body.
why?
you must eat, you're big bones.
that's why i brought you to chinese restaurant.
let me eat whatever i want.
it won't work.
what happened to your cousin who lost weight to the gym?
look, it's fatter than it used to be.
cover up sofia, for god's sake.
that's what girls wear.
how long?
come on, you like it.
of course you do.
you like it.
you always do what you know.
you're pushing me to make me out.
i'm not hungry anymore.
do you like what you did?
you took my appetite.
so, really...
you're a rebel.
how can i eat more than you without weight?
i looked around and all i could find were you two fatheads.
you're more than normal, and your sister's a little heavy.
fat bitch's already ruined my life.
you have a lot of babies.
i just found one.
and there i was 0.
it's not that important to adopt.
it's not a biological family matter.
stop kidding!
don't say things like that.
i'm gonna go crazy and leave the house.
thank god.
lucis, you're not adopted.
what about dna test?
if that's somehow made it right.
nuria must have forgotten to do the melons.
i did them, i put them in theermomix vaporism.
how'd you get them to the dowroulo damage?
i wrapped up in an aliminium foly folo and held it in the middle 00 minutes heat.
ten.
how did he do it again?
thanks for what?
thanks to me.
pilar, i'm rehearsing.
so i can fuck you.
how good of you to think of my analysis needs.
you don't...
of course i like it.
it's a great tool.
would you like to try?
this is our routine now.
we bring him chocolate, but since he can't eat, we eat.
then i throw up.
then we share a movie, a super long time.
then i throw up.
then dinner, some champagne, a beautiful view...
and i... vomit.
then he comfortes me.
then i comfort her.
i die!
why do you think you're throwing up so much?
i've come to conceal that some reasons don't stay long in my body.
they were watching my digest for normal, but suddenly, she's starting to work.
i know what you're thinking, therapist.
aren't you tired of this bullshit?
aren't you tired of reality?
my life is normal for the first time.
just as i knew you were right to keep eating the pig like a pig.
he's convicting a man who doesn't deserve him.
what, paula?
what?
you tell me.
discuss it later.
no, we'll discuss it now.
i don't care!
it's your fault i'm unhappy all day.
is that how she treats you?
does he throw away your food?
does it make you feel like shit?
or is it just me?
explain to me why you don't love me, that you don't like me, that i make you sick!
you know how much i hate you.
and you, watch your fucking kids.
now we've learned your bullshit, therapist.
"and the light came to the world...
" because the bad things that do bad things stay away from the light, and they hide from it, you'll be punished."
stop, stop.
what are you doing?
go on.
it's my turn, not yours.
what's your secret for?
since when do you become more than an orgasm?
first you wanted to be on top, now you want to be an orgasm twice.
what next?
i don't know, we'll find out.
were you touching yourself?
is that why you stay so long in the bathroom?
stop it.
are you crazy?
don't mess with me.
come here.
don't be stupid.
you made me do everything!
damn!
look how annoying you made me.
you think i like being like this?
look what i'm in.
do you think that's good?
look at me, sofia.
look at me.
you think i want this?
no, my love.
i look at you, you look dirty.
dirty, dirty, dirty!
you...
fucking tool.
what are you doing?
i'm trying to start it.
drowning it won't work.
tell me the truth, dad.
i want to know the truth.
your weakness doesn't mean you're not family.
you're disgusting, fat and ugly, but you're smart, like my mother, nuria.
you always treat me like a fool.
i don't fit into this shitty family.
okay, i'll repeat the test to prove it to you.
but you're so smart.
no stupid part of her body.
what are you doing?
i need a test.
i have to cut off their balls.
smart boy!
i've been with you for ten years.
can't things get hard?
or is this hard?
am i the one?
therapist who treated fat people can't stand the image of his own fat wife.
you brought your job home.
look at me.
you can't even look at me.
don't you like me anymore?
tell me.
tell me what's hard on me.
i don't want to look at you!
i love you with all my heart and i can't think of a life without you.
it's like i'm the smartest person in the world.
because you are.
it's called "fucking letter."
"my mum asked jesus,
'how can a man be born?
or judah or 0 or 0 or 0 or
it's my part.
"sofi, i know i'll never be reborn, i can't go back to fix my mistakes.
all i can do is learn from them to be stronger and don't repeat them.
you're the one i want to be better and be happy with.
i'd like to be thrown into the way of adventure and salvation.
alex.
deal?
yeah, deal.
will everything be the same?
it'll be the same.
no sex until the wedding.
and my orgasms?
okay.
and you'll get fat again.
what? what?????
you said it: everything will be the same.
don't i look better now?
of course you do.
that's why i said it.
to get us out of the devil.
ass!
you've always put me down this whole time, made me think i can't do better.
i'm ashamed to be with you.
i'm happy this happened today because i realized i never wanted to see you again.
dirty!
jesus?
i'm sorry, jesus.
first, you or me?
you.
leave me, leave me, let go!
i left him.
i love you, but i don't love you.
this kind of relationship creates a lot of addiction.
we decided to stay friends.
and we agreed on that.
it was a typical goodbye sex.
i wasn't fat.
and i was pretty.
and wild.
my doubts have begun.
maybe the breakup wasn't a good idea.
we decided to be together.
every night, the sleeping pussy and the worrying came back.
he wasn't there to relax me.
i felt so awful i came to therapy on the wrong day.
sorry, i think i got the wrong watch.
it's not the wrong time, it's wrong.
i'm in the bar.
i didn't want to go home.
all of a sudden i realized a man was looking at me.
i thought how fat i was and i wanted to get up.
i asked the waiter account, but he said he paid for my drink.
i don't know how it happened, the guy just set me up.
we were drinking whiskey instead of coffee.
he kept saying how beautiful i was, and he wasn't bad.
then i remember what i said about trying new things to try new things, i come up with other men, experience, and i find myself...
that's how i met the second guy i slept with.
what can i say?
it was better than any therapy.
i was desired, i wasn't fat.
of course, i couldn't stop myself eating fat and disgusting and disgusting.
i was supposed to be comfort...
i wasn't supposed to be comfortable.
that's how i met the third guy i slept with that time.
but something made me feel that you wouldn't approve of my behavior.
your idea may not mean much to me, but i guess i wasn't ready to hear it.
let's go.
where?
to london to meet your wife and children.
where did you think it was?
that's how i met the fourth man i've ever slept with.
it was handsome, like the second and third, and there was a happy marriage.
so i decided to keep sleeping with handsome and married men for three reasons:
i didn't want to interfere.
i convinced her this morning would never happen again.
what convinced you?
back to german.
i guess that's why i slept with all those guys.
i thought it would be easier to forget german.
if he didn't leave because i lost 00 pounds, maybe he would have left me for sleeping with 00 guys.
you see, there's something i've decided to go after.
decided to go after what?
i don't know.
i don't even know if i want you to help me or fuck me.
or do you help me fuck me?
because you're handsome and i know you're married.
and you, what's up?
jesus!
i loved you so much!
paula!
pregnant lady, are you there?
ice cream melting!
paula!
hi, i'm abel.
i don't understand why men with handsome and happy marriage would want to sleep with a fat woman.
i was wondering.
until one day he stopped wondering.
so don't worry, i won't ask.
what's wrong?
you ruined everything.
everything.
it was a joke.
if i let your jokes impress me like this, i'd have already killed myself.
i'm glad my husband isn't my sister-in-law.
cut the crap.
of course we are twins.
if our fathers are different, we're not.
what? what?????
the different fathers of twins of twins of the two of you
you screwed up this time!
tell me who it is!
tell!
tell!
what's going on?
what's going on here?
tell him who his father is.
you're my father.
at least tell her!
tell him who you are!
he deserves to know who his father is!
tell him who he's fucking with me!
i've been with you my whole life!
i've been through this shit!
hi, i'm abel.
please come.
i'm so scared.
what are you doing, pilar?
i'm trying to put your wedding ring on, but it's not happening.
he had a weight in the coma.
forget it.
listen to me.
go home and get a glass of milk from those sleeping pills.
you're emotionally surprised.
what are you doing?
let me try.
he'd like that too.
marry me.
what do you say, pilar?
should we cross the funeral straight to the wedding?
you should think about it.
i've been thinking.
marry me, please.
why would a good-looking, smart, loving woman get married to a gay man?
me.
i don't understand.
my love for you is true.
i don't even know if you like me a little.
i live for you.
just for you.
marry me.
the video's loading.
"lons fuck" loading.
i never expected you to be perfect for 00 years because you were.
you were perfect for me.
we were perfect for each other.
we had everything.
i know it happens once in a lifetime.
i'll be in the hospital for three days.
when i get out of here, i want you to leave the house.
you know it's a lot of damage.
today we discuss the role of the woman and the man's marriage.
it may look very clear, but it's more alarming than you think.
no, love...
please, don't...
don't go!
come pray with me!
sofia, what's wrong?
somebody do something.
please!
you have to do this yourself.
but all you can trust is yourself.
and you're just gonna get victory.
i'm my second step second step
i never took care of my kids.
they were just invitations there, invitations, invitations, invitations that were there to snoop and moon.
what if it's not one of me?
i don't mind, do i?
i must be glad.
i was 00 yesterday.
i didn't think i'd live that long.
i wasn't wrong.
even if i die, i can't lose weight.
i had to put nuria's real father in the head and lived in a tent for six months.
i took dna test for our family, our friends, neighbors.
i even got an example from my sister fhim in fhum in the field, instead of sleeping with beatriz, after lunch at the countryside.
