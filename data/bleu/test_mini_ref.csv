life - is it a one time event... ..or is it something that's occurred lots of times throughout the universe?
and, at this very moment, new discoveries are bringing us closer to the answers.
we are right on the cusp of being able to say life exists somewhere else.
all of our searching is leading to one ultimate goal..
finding intelligent life somewhere in the vastness of the universe.
get ready, because the known universe is about to take you on a hunt for life out there.
creatures that make the wildest science fiction movies look like reality shows.
so is earth the only planet where life has emerged in this vast cosmos?
are we alone?
are we alone?
and it ties into all the big questions:
are we a part of a bigger picture?
but for many years the question was taboo to science.
because looking for alien life seems a little frighteningly close to science fiction.
for decades, the furthest we got in looking for aliens was imagining them on the silver screen.
after all, alien life needs a home.
and we hadn't even found a planet outside our own solar system.
scientists, in fact, never talked about planets around other stars.
in 1 995, astronomers discovered a planet orbiting a star 50 light years from earth.
and since then, they've found hundreds more.
sunrise here does not bring the sound of birdsong.
instead, it's an armageddon of volcanic explosions.
those planets are all going to be so hot, you can't develop something as complex as life.
we don't know that life has to evolve on the surface of small, rocky planets.
but we know it did once, here on earth.
and so, it's a reasonable place to start the search.
earth is important because we know that this little planet had everything needed to create life.
there's a long list of factors that make our earth special and perfectly suited for life.
but the most important is its distance from our energy source - the sun.
at 1 49 million kilometres away, the earth is at just the right place for water to exist as a liquid.
so why is liquid water important?
such a place would be like a desert.
without water, there's nothing to let the grains of sand interact.
this frozen block of sand has all of the grains of sand locked together.
but if temperatures and conditions are just right, like here on earth, you get liquid water.
all that water was perfect for breeding life.
lots of it.
and the same thing occurs here on earth.
take this handful of dirt.
it's not just dirt, there's a lot going on in here.
there's an earthworm.
go in a little more... ..and there are these tiny little mites.
zoom in further... ..and there are these little creatures called protozoa.
and smaller still... ..there's bacteria, billions of them.
life isn't always something you can see with the naked eye.
in these piles of dirt lie the secrets to our origins.
and scientists are keeping that in perspective when they search for life in the cosmos.
you have to be looking for that bacterium first, because that's gonna be far more common.
but searching for another earth is like trying to find a needle in a million haystacks.
hard, but not impossible.
every now and again, the planet passes directly between us and the star.
it gets darker because the planet is blocking the light from that star.
and it turns out we can see that.
the mission, called kepler, may not help us find extra terrestrial life but it could help us find its home.
and that's exactly what the kepler spacecraft can detect.
kepler can detect a .01 per cent change in a star's luminosity.
but even if it spots a dimming star, there's still another problem.
this telescope will also determine the planet's mass and distance from its star.
remember how important liquid water is to life?
if a planet is in the goldilocks zone, it's not too close and not too far from its star.
it'sjust right.
and it's possible for water to flow there as a liquid.
knowing if a planet is inhabitable is not as straightforward as saying,
venus is uninhabitable and mars is uninhabitable.
when it formed over four billion years ago,
venus had water, and probably vast oceans on its surface.
on earth, much of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide is chemically bound to the rocks.
and it was this way on young venus, too.
and it has sulphuric acid rain.
you know, venus is basically, by every definition, hell.
with so many ways a habitable planet can be rendered uninhabitable,
it will do this by only looking at 1 00,000 stars out of at least 200 billion in our galaxy.
but how is it possible to calculate the number of earth-like planets orbiting other stars without looking at all the stars?
it's like asking how many blades of grass are there on this soccer field.
we have a little grid - two inches by two inches on each side.
207.
207 blades of grass in a two inch by two inch patch.
now, let's get out the calculator here and see what that means.
now we need the number of square inches in this field.
it's 1 80 by 360.
wow, that's almost 1 0 million square inches in this field.
it seems awfully likely.
but is it really luck?
or does life find a way?
there are new discoveries showing us there might just be another recipe for life to emerge.
we have a general idea of what conditions are crucial for life to thrive on a planet.
for us, that's our sun.
by far, the most important discovery i've ever made was not the titanic.
it was when we discovered this whole new life system on our planet.
bob ballard found a thriving ecosystem where there was no sunlight.
there were creatures we'd never seen before.
prior to that discovery, we thought that all life on the earth owed its existence to the sun.
without sunlight, there was something else giving this life energy.
it was coming from deep inside the earth's core.
hot enough to melt lead.
and the bizarre environments didn't stop at the bottom of the ocean.
life is found in the worst environments you could imagine.
like the boiling hot springs of yellowstone national park.
the hot springs at yellowstone can be ph1 , just like battery acid... ..and 1 94 degrees.
if you went into this, it would dissolve you.
dr mark young is an astrobiologist looking very closely at yellowstone's hot springs.
and the gases that come out of the boiling hot springs like yellowstone.
those pits in yellowstone are just nasty.
in fact, the acid in them can dissolve just about anything.
now watch what happens to this penny when i drop it in the acid.
i'm gonna put this bell jar over to control the environment.
we're finding micro-organisms not only living in these hot springs but flourishing.
even under the surfaces of planets or nearby moons.
and there's a very good suggestion, i think, that there are, in fact, liquid aquifers.
we might be able to drill down and find the evidence, if any, of life on mars at this moment.
there's no telling what kind of life may exist in europa's ocean.
and the atmosphere has lots of methane in it.
not liquid water, but liquid methane.
titan actually has lakes, rain and rivers made of liquid natural gas, liquid methane.
that probably isn't quite as good as water, but at least it's a medium.
things can flow around, begin to form bonds.
fluid is where it's at.
other environments very different from that on the earth could harbour life.
new discoveries constantly shift our perspective on where alien life might exist.
because life out there might be stranger than hollywood could have ever dreamt up.
the hunt for life in the cosmos is intensifying.
with potentially billions of planets harbouring life, like earth.
it's completely reasonable to think that there's life out there.
surely there's life out there.
once we have the microbial, we have the potential for intelligence.
but if we don't have a life form at all, we don't have the potential for anything.
what if we do find complex life out there?
what would it look like?
would it be anything like what we see in hollywood movies?
it is humorous that hollywood depicts aliens more or less the same way.
any sort of alien that resembles a human is ludicrous - two eyes, a nose, and a mouth.
there's no reason an alien would have to be adapted this way.
basically, all animals are worms.
we're worms - we've got a head, we've got a tail.
what people don't understand is that evolution is not a road map.
humans are not at the top of the evolutionary ladder.
we're not the end point, the goal of evolution, or anything like that.
we're accidents, we're random.
we eat through our mouths but we breathe through our mouths and we can choke on food.
that's a terrible design.
it's an accident of evolution.
maybe aliens evolved differently.
maybe they don't need to breathe.
maybe they can get oxygen in some other way.
a planet with very little gravity would be like our moon or mars.
life on a low gravity planet might be tall and thin, with long legs.
i think we are currently ignorant, actually, about the real realistic diversity of life elsewhere.
life in the universe may be incredibly diverse.
but could it all have come from the same place?
comets have a lot of organic materials on them.
some meteorites have amino acids in them.
these are the building blocks, the precursors, of life.
so at least the building blocks of life could have come from space.
it's good.
here i've got the projectile that is embedded with some organics.
so the real question is; will this survive if we hammer it at a high speed?
we're gonna be firing this at around three-and-a-half kilometres per second.
this would be about the speed of something surviving entry into the atmosphere.
this is a pretty special gun.
this drives me nuts.
(buzzer)
this was...gorgeous.
whoa!
we gotta go see what we did.
oh, what a mess.
oh, this is dynamite.
schultz scours the impact chamber, hunting for remnants of the projectile.
this is like looking for your lost contact on a beach.
let's see what we have.
oh, that is so sweet.
we did the experiment, we collected some pieces.
you can see it here in this image.
you can see the fracturing, but even though it's fractured, it's not melted.
panspermia is not that far-fetched after all.
it says you can transport the seeds of life, if not life itself, from one planet to another.
however life began on our planet, it eventually evolved to develop intelligence.
and ultimately, our goal is to see if that's happened somewhere else in the universe.
we're looking for another civilisation that's either like us or not like us, but is clearly intelligent.
that's the holy grail of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.
with the closest stars light years away, is it possible to actually travel there?
or will first contact be made some other way?
but why haven't we contacted or been contacted by any of them?
first of all, there's a lot of empty space out there.
the very nearest star to us is four light years away.
so that's a very big problem.
but how about we just call them up?
after all, radio signals travel at the speed of light.
it takes a hundred years to get here and we say,
another hundred years back and forth.
it's a century travel time.
that's a boring conversation.
so we've been intelligent in the sense we've had the same brain size for about 1 00,000 years.
there can be a lot of miscommunications when trying a cosmic chat.
we could think of communicating with an alien civilisation as like a game of cosmic catch.
the stadium...is the galaxy.
and the ball is our message.
so if we send the ball out into the stadium, odds are nobody's there to receive it.
of course, we could luck out and actually send our message towards an alien civilisation.
but what if that civilisation was technologically 500 years or more behind where we are?
well, that would be like throwing a baseball to a baby.
(cries)
here you go.
well, that would be our first contact with an extraterrestrial civilisation.
at the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, seth shostack is doing just that.
these are the individual antennas of the allen telescope array.
these distances between stars are enormously vast.
most interstellar visiting is gonna be via signalling, not by actual visiting.
and what are we broadcasting out into the cosmos?
how would we respond?
it's something we've thought about a lot.
the united nations has even drawn up a manifesto about what we would do.
it raises the question, who represents earth?
who represents the homo sapiens?
and i think the only way to decide this will be with some very seriously thought-out process.
would aliens really want to do us harm?
probably not.
aliens we contact will at least have learned to live with themselves peacefully.
we are closer than ever to finding answers to one of mankind's greatest questions..
are we alone?
there is something in us that wants to find our place.
we are exploring and every discovery we make will help us understand our very existence.
we want to be a part of something bigger than ourselves.
we know deep down that our lives are flickering moments of glory.
finding the answer could be mankind's greatest challenge.
oh, you live round here?
only those prepared to die will find eternal life.
you've got everything i need.
and when i've finished with you, you will be a child no longer.
can you hear me?
could you get the doorbell, please?
get the keys.
i know i won't get your thanks, gratitude or respect.
it's through stories that we come to understand ourselves and we come to understand the world.
it's our own experience that is the starting point for all our creativity.
now, i want you to think about who you are.
if you lived with a secret and the secret meant that you must always lie or be alone and you'd always lived that way and yet you longed for change what would you do?
are you unwell?
but before the grave took him, two men entered his life.
i found a corpse.
"""a true account of my making and my life in death from the year of my birth, 1804."""
forgiveness is a christian value, ruthven.
but you do have the qualities one needs.
eleanor, how can you be two centuries old?
i felt i'd lived my whole wretched life just to prepare me for that moment.
it was easy.
he wasn't worthy of your gift.
there are no women amongst us.
i learnt that immortality is unendurable alone.
i took my darling to the nameless isle and i let the thing save her.
if you kissed me right now will i live forever?
look, claire's not happy.
what do you think you're doing, telling that fucking school who we are?
there is a rule that we live by and you broke it.
no, no, leave her!
clara!
i still have the advantage.
we have to get to frank.
you have been condemned from the moment clara made you.
amazing, how two little girls with no money and learning slipped through your fingers for an eternity.
because if i wasn't the one to find you, they certainly would have killed you.
with their pointed nails of justice.
if you could have anything, what would it be?
what are you doing?
he's rich, kind, handsome, and really sophisticated.
this is a beautiful color
how can a mom not know where her daughter is?
you're au duh lee out there but are you au duh lee here too?
