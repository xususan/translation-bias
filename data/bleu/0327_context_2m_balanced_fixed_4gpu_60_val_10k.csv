michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, her sister, buster, who she shared her bed.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss mom.
i'll tell her.
i need to write a 000 words on the moral side of the war and the possibility of a conflict.
i'm not sure our vice teacher would like me to cheat while writing.
well, you passed my ethics test.
as a matter of fact, it was desperate for your teacher... who was desperate to have a crush.
even the hands of those who commit small crimes can be brutally chopped off.
no ring no ring no ring no ring no
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted father?
the s.d.k.'s eye was on us.
your dad thought it would make us look better.
he must have imitated my signature.
'maybe i'll have a son who's done slum cheese' a year ago!
you gotta get me out of this.
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't look at her either.
i don't have a mother's compassion and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yes-yes.
by the way, when did you sleep with anyone?
meanwhile, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
i'm telling you why.
i guess it's because there's some things you can't tell your dad about.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set up his teacher... to help him fulfill his motherhood.
there's nothing wrong with that.
however, i must say i'm a little hurt that you didn't think of me for that.
the halas can carry out this mission.
teachers can do that job.
surely, someday, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right in front of you.
lindsay had never been more proud of what she said her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i've been telling you about.
she's really... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
you have a moustache.
i mean, there's milk on the moustache.
yeah.
but gob mistook michael's kindness for sentimental attention... and feels he's competition to interfere.
because, you know, beyond adorable... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
_
and george scr was about to get a surprise visit.
i've read all your teachings and got all your tapes.
and i watched it all over again.
george s.r. recently released a series of tapes he'd given to people... to raise money from the spirituality he'd recently discovered.
i also lost two kilos of your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to learn.
this is a good place to start.
and after michael got rid of the two girls he had an appointment with, he met lindsay at parents' night.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this place have the same floor plan as our kitchen floor with our kitchen floor?
i think she's really good for you.
i used to think it would make him think of the motherhood.
besides, i can't rush into something like this just because my son wants me to, and i can't marry somebody.
i'm miss baerly, the ethics teacher.
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life... that could have been destroyed by a reckless trigger.
and michael got to know his son's ethics teacher.
that's the "rrrr" thing.
you know, it's so annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you were laughing.
"rrrr!" - "rrrr!"
but, you know, she's, like,
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a question for you.
can a parent-teacher invite a drink?
or... or... or... or... or
yeah, he's dead.
i think it's because of this mr. daniels stroke thing...
let's go get a drink.
yeah, maybe it'll help.
_
i've already told you many of my sins.
maybe you can tell me some of your sins.
well, there are legal demonstrations to my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me one of those things about... one of the things that happened in the college dorm.
and what is it that michael's meeting mrs. bayerly on his second date today...
michael, this little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it's him.
you have to peel it down to your pants to say one thing for sure.
yes, mother.
they'll take him back.
don't take your shoes off, little gentleman.!
don't take your shoes off!
he's out of control.
who is it?
this is "annong," your father and i adopted it.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille found out that buster was worried and even jealous.
and she knew how it felt to be overlooked.
annyong is now your sister's sister's sister's
cancel.
it stays.
listen, i'll call you back.
nice driving.
are you making dinner reservations?
he made a korean.
and after the dates....
michael took a step he hadn't taken in years.
well, do you think this is a good idea?
i think that's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we sneak in without waking everyone up?
this may not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i loved.
so i took someone you love.
i said "nashbagerblairjam."
listen, i know you're trying to get revenge on the marta thing.
i was lying to you when i told you i wouldn't try to sleep with her, so...
she has to admit it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i'm lucky i got rid of him.
it's okay.
so romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i have to say i don't know if it's real.
but now... your morality teacher...
yeah, i did it for her.
oh.
she loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm sure you're interested in her on the subject.
i'm sure you don't like sadam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to him to show that i care about him.
about the class?
i mean, i'm telling her that she loves my loyalty...
hey, george michael.
let me go home and think about this.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with him.
well, why did he do that?
why did she sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new...
he's not one of the good shooters who's targeting his target, and he's practically shooting everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think she's old?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
she was accompanying different dance girls... and i thought i'd go to her, go up to her, do something...
"hey, do you wanna dance?"
and she was like, "what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it different across the mirror, but...
but, you know, it was, like, we were dancing with a joke, or something.
i didn't think so detail.
don't you think you should go out with your own age?
like your cousin.
i stubbed a book that was difficult to find a picture of saddam's disappointment in the bathroom suite.
"what would saddam have done?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's exactly like our fire escape.
in prison, george s.r. was getting ready for the evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon is preparing his own prep.
how we doing?
we have a video.
and when george michael was still angry with gob... he went looking for a family expert to cause trouble.
i know you went out with shannon.
with that cheerleader?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different dances.
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and asked him... but he was breathing, and he dropped his phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe we should both go.
right, i mean, a bad example...
hello.
my mother took him.
he's making me sign him up for school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the situation with mrs. bearly and george michael.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
so you're interested in her.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality...
see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's in love with you, so...
she knows we're out.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most unpleasant thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been a half a semester of morality.
look, it was a preemptive move.
my brother was gonna try to sleep with you.
well, i want to leave you right now and i'm not coming back to you.
i understand.
starting right now.
_
george.
and she got to know him.
you can totally spill your heart to me here.
it's weighing on my soul.
you...
he's picking up the camera.
i'm taking you to the grandong dance, that's your dinner, so it's away with mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong man.
watch your back, my immigration little brother!
and the different spring dances were in the final tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you don't let her in just because she doesn't have your perfectly flawed, flawed-shaped nose-shaped eyes, strong square jaws.
wanna dance?
all right!
gob finally found shannon he was looking for...
he found out that gob had cheated on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i messed up our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about it for a long time, and-and...
that's... that's the right thing to do.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing at a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yes, with my ethical teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
i'm really touched that you're trying to protect me after i treated you so badly.
in fact, gob mistook michael's ethical teacher for the ethics teacher.
man, the type... she understands.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a teacher of citizenship.
second move.
i was talking to miss baerly, and i should never have brought gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed on some sad things, but...
i don't think we have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm taking this cake.
hey, you wanna dance?
i can't believe this is working.
next arrested in development.
buster's pull is toast.
stop, stop, stop, stop!!!!!!!!!!
it's forbidden to have candles here.
my mom would freak.
no, it's okay.
i light my candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
it's okay.
right here, let me help you.
these?
okay, here, i'll carry it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is something really, really extreme.
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
all right!
all right!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we'll all go one day, won't we?
four months ago, each of you joined an interview to join a never-before-seen tv show.
and guess what?
you won.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm a total gay guy and i'm proud of it.
that's sweet, isn't it?
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel, from england.
me too.
he's my brother stanton, my parole officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him over the head.
she doesn't know.
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
now they look like barack obama.
each of you will make $00,000, all you have to do is spend a night in this prison.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
fuck!
cool.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know it's not a prank?
right.
it's actually our third show, but we're not gonna run until the fall.
to find out if this is a prank, you're gonna have to play the game and earn the money.
you will be asked to perform a series of duties.
duties will force your borders, your courage and your imagination.
that sounds fun, right?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make up your mind now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i didn't have a girlfriend to admit it when she was high.
i have to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
around.
you'll notice.
the sum of money equally cut to the survivors of the survivors, but if you all get the night out, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can spend the night here.
anyone else want to join him?
i'm not.
there's no way i'm going to the city with this piss boy that i'm
i'm in.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you guys are idiots.
it's a fucking party joke, they're gonna fuck you all up.
you don't look like a bunch of idiots.
can't you see this is a recording party?
or get famous.
there's a human head there!
don't worry, it's not real.
it looked pretty real to me.
that's why they call us "special effects".
isn't it lovely?
a little sign of what's waiting for you in there.
thanks to our bounty special effects team.
follow me, friends.
in the hot swamp water, lazy alligators are waiting for their prey.
the indian crocodiles become long and spotted faces.
such gators...
guys.
i see you're working hard as usual.
ready?
we're all set.
and absolutely.
keep it up.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was a great job to scare them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are gonna go to the show.
you really looked like you were terrified.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, i look at this place, and it gives me the creeps.
did you know that?
the dead homeless?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
it must be a big coincidence.
you really think it's safe there?
safe enough for the insurance on the show.
any other questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're recording.
each of you has chosen your own free will to spend the night in prison to make $00,000 a head.
it's obvious, isn't it?
all right, let's get this party started.
you'll find everything you need in your main camp, that's the warden's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you took everything we had, so how can we write it?
go down the hall, turn right, right, right, then left.
straight up the stairs, left, right, and another left.
would you like me to repeat that?
yeah.
too bad.
there you will find a key to get rid of your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll have to wait and see.
i thought leaving the basement was awful.
enjoy, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to the mission.
would you mind not doing that?
i can't see a damn thing here.
does anybody remember where we were going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, two right, then left.
there was so much going on.
no, go straight down the hall, down the hall, no,
"go back to the left, make it right again, and left.
"then straight up to the stairs,
"sola, right and left again."
what are you?
smart.
illet, it's gonna be a great show.
careful.
careful.
oh, god.
what is this place?
and be ready.
it was fun.
let's speed them up.
okay, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
the power's going down, the generator should've kicked in.
fuck!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's cold in here.
look, the key.
yeah.
okay.
guys, look.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think so.
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what's up, man?
"hey, brave contestants.
"welcome to warden clem harvis' office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room.
"the chess rocks will determine your personal role.
"you cannot exchange your stones with other contestants.
"the raids were her favourite."
"now it's your turn to put your hand in the box".
shit.
well, who wants first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black hawk.
black rook.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
fuck!
that was really crazy.
my little piggies, welcome to duty.
now let me tell you about the pennyville state prison.
in 0000, with the cost in 0000, the cruel warden decided to increase his fortune by destroying certain expenses.
they were prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the warden's crimes were revealed.
the last person to be sentenced to death here was warden harvis himself.
rumor has it the warden was still wandering the halls.
you will be asked to face the principal tonight and face tortured souls under this building.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
does anyone want to change?
hell no!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the church of prison to complete his duty.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first hallway.
that sounds awesome.
thanks.
fuck!
what happened?
they turned off my flashlight.
i can't see anything.
all right, take it easy, randall.
turn right now and go straight.
they hanged the babies!
kids...
i think they've got it covered with speakerons.
the voices are more efficient than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
god!
that sounds lovely.
no, i'm fine, man.
freak.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
something came up.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're making a noise on the speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off the flashlight.
all right now?
_
"you will find the lord's prayer there.
"there has been disrespect for this place that was sacred 00 years ago,
"now this is the focus of unusual events."
oh, "the opposite."
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do that.
"by complete your mission...
"if there's no sign of a president,
"you can go back to camp."
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry about who i'm bothering.
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
" deliver us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"do not let evil rule us.
"and do not overcome us...
"for as we forgive those who owe us, forgive us our debts.
"give us our daily bread today.
"it's so heavenly...
"as in the sky,
"because rule and rule are yours."
please tell me i can go now.
"before i head for camp"...
jesus, randall, you need to blow out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look at the money made.
where'd she go?
from what i understand, the people who did this job had cut off our connection to our homo friend for a while to give us a more creepy weather.
whatever.
absolutely, it went very well.
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, dude, it's not that bad.
it's definitely not worth the money.
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it again.
they can assign you back.
don't joke.
i swear you don't even know how you feel there.
it's like walking in a thick fog, only as cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it just me, or does this feel cooler here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go to the next one.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you expect me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated.
let's get scelzi to go down and have a look, you'll fix it.
scelzi.
yeah.
i need you to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
either we talk or i'll go or i'll go or i
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i had a little research done.
are you talking about the girls from the town you sleep with when you say "don't move"?
am i right?
big lips, large hips, taylor.
okay, well, prison wasn't just for men, was it?
is there a women's department?
and the goddamn crazy manager wouldn't tell anyone if she'd walk around the women's section.
beat them, rape them, get them pregnant, and they starve.
some people say she's been feeding their own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this real story's gonna make a good turn!
everyone might be talking to us.
the story you made up is nothing compared to the truth.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do that, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
yeah?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they do.
good.
scelzi, what is that?
just a little something to get me through the night.
want some?
get your hairy ass here now, okay?
aye, aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the hell out of me.
i've got some pretty good stuff.
suit yourself.
we're totally ready to start.
i'd say my biggest fear is being buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will set you free."
ok, ok,
i'm at the end of liberty.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go right and turn right.
fuck!
what?
blood.
it's not real blood.
no swearing, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs are not below, but going up.
i'm sorry.
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down there, you'll see a door with bars.
he says...
fuck!
welcome to cell number five.
" considering the violence and insanity and the madness,
shit.
tell me what to do and i'll be out of this hell right now.
no!
thanks.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a prisoner can't commit suicide, if he can't,
"you will now live the punishment sent to a prisoner."
okay, where's the pit?
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult mission.
"what will you do when you're in the hole."
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my mission.
connie.
what?
check this out.
what?
it can't be...
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back and i specifically told you that you added something to the show, and you're still asking me why you were fired?
this is not our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you have to get that guy out, okay?
he's gonna fuck up the show.
fuck!
we'll be ruined.
and you didn't bring this?
cut it out, no.
it's obvious.
what's open?
come closer.
i asked you why you put a camera in the control room.
yeah.
the camera footage... they want to record the footage...
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
it's genius, isn't it?
absolutely brilliant.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to record how you scare us by putting something into the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
three.
black king and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you could come back.
smartass.
okay, black king and white horse go right and go to the gas chamber.
the white queen and the black horse go straight, and they go to the prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"the hawk and the horse go left and then right.
"take and ride down the hall to the end of the hall,
"and down the stairs".
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, pick up.
we're in.
"welcome to the gathering room.
there's gotta be a light in the back of your wall, turn it on.
" black king and white horse go into the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
it deserved the best, but it was a real place.
it's the only place the legal department can clean up.
isn't it beautiful?
pretty creepy.
oh, god.
what's that smell?
a documented true execution rooms often carry the smell of death itself.
of course, the smell is not your death.
when a man knows that his life is in its final moments, his anxious anxiety is caused by an epidemic that stinks too much.
in this case, the human smell we breathe now and the smell of the gas that killed him.
now for the fun time, ladies and gentlemen.
the black king is sitting in the chair.
black hawk?
that would be me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you'll find some meat and a pan.
"you'll cook and eat this meat."
man!
the inmates have always eaten the beef, pig, pig...
"or that there is no lamb or another meat...
"they were suspicious of it.
"they thought it was a pleasant meat they never tasted before."
you mean human flesh, right?
are you in?
yeah.
guess what now?
i give up.
you're gonna tie toni up.
i'm telling you, toni should fully experience the fear of the previous prisoners... before gassing gas.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends have some weird wishes.
are you okay?
okay.
"your job is to...
"to find the main van dead and cut the gas."
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
wanna bet?
$000 you're gonna throw up.
okay.
strange.
i can't do that.
i can't.
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
"no more donkey joke."
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they'll pay the extra."
do it for the team, girl.
are you gonna throw up?
thanks.
okay, angel, i'm at the bottom of the stairs.
fuck!
can you hear me?
he's back.
it really stinks.
let me out.
come on.
get me out, man.
god!
who's that guy standing there?
topless.
muscle.
let me out.
i don't know, con. this guy is starting to creep me out.
stop playing games.
let me out.
how's it going?
we need to talk to you.
outside?
yeah.
big news.
i think the company's playing us.
what?
who's there?
who are you?
show me the chamber.
and what do we do with the castle teller?
where are they?
i don't know, just give me a few seconds.
there.
did you see that man again?
wow!
who's that?
okay, how could she have got here so fast?
isn't that the guy in the picture?
yeah.
yeah, she looks like him.
nice.
no, it's not cool.
this guy either gets through walls, or there's more than one man.
we've all been watching "privej," haven't we?
do you mind if we pass?
please?
guys?
guys?
fake blood, fake incident.
they did beautifully.
maybe even oscar.
no.
no, that's not true.
it's completely out of the script.
sounds real to me.
connie, they're playing us.
trust me.
what?
look.
they copied the picture.
what?
acting.
clothes.
easy.
stop.
no.
no.
he's a real ghost.
i can't translate any more.
if it goes any further, it'll be out of my sight.
what?
this is a big prison.
i can't put a camera everywhere.
show me the pit.
show me the chamber.
taylor, someone ought to go over there and see if they're okay.
i'd say they don't look good.
he's acting.
then where's scelzi?
i don't know.
he's probably hiding somewhere.
i'll call the office.
okay, you too.
good night.
they don't know what's going on.
i feel bad.
okay, i'll go and prove it to you.
it's okay.
anyone coming?
i'm coming.
i'll get my camera, see if i can get some good footage.
thank you.
you have to be nice to them.
you'll make it snappy!
"you'll make peace."
you know what?
you really are photogenic.
you're so funny, kid.
i want to do my duty now.
cut the air conditioning.
come on.
connie, what do you want to do?
stop the game.
wow, this place looks haunted, doesn't it?
it gets a little weird.
where did he go?
i don't know.
i didn't see him.
it's headed this way.
_
what was that?
yeah, what was that?
shit.
taylor?
put angel on screen.
we have to get them out of there.
can you hear me?
listen to me.
there's been some changes in the plan.
we need to stop the show.
what?
why?
i'll be honest with you.
there's one more person with you.
who?
we're not sure.
i want you to get out of there as fast as possible, okay?
are you playing games with me?
you're trying to scare me.
open the door.
i want to get my money.
open the door!
who opened the door?
sorry, you're not serious, are you?
idiot!
your mission is to memorize and find the location of the marked cell seven.
lucky!
in this cell, warden harvis was wounded deadly by a prisoner.
you'll find a key in that cell, this key will release both your friend in the hole and in the gas chamber.
great.
was that all?
it was the easiest money i ever made.
what am i afraid of?
nothing.
angel!
stanton?
help!
well, now he's out of my sight.
hello?
who's there?
hello?
angel?
angel.
let me down.
who are you?
angel?
angel!
what... what... what... what...
it's not real.
let me down.
wait.
it's you.
no!
angel, are you okay?
he killed my brother.
he's gonna kill me too.
he killed my brother.
new jersey school of acting.
not bad for a guy like me, is it?
connie, are you there?
yeah.
how could you organize this?
we had a hard time.
it's gonna be a great show.
i'll see you later.
let me get this shit out of the first?
you're such an asshole.
you said you wanted a great show, didn't you?
you got what you wanted.
yeah.
solve toni, i'll get dixon and stanton.

excellent acting.
show's over.
toni?
good job, dixon.
okay, dixon.
it's over, man.

we have to get them out of there.
we have to get them out of there.

where's the plane protection footage?
you can break the rules, but you need a specific order.

do you know that elevator is just for emergencies?
escort 0, what's your status?
are you uneasy, juney?
you'd be less uptight if you just kept being my london girlfriend.
that position won't be open for long.
i spy with my little eye beginning with that letter...
engines are going fast.
put them on the screen.
calum, nearest police units?
whatever we got, come on.

oh, god.
june, for god's sake, don't.

what the fuck are you doing, harry?

open the gates!
come on, come on, come on!

heading north!
no, no!
keaton!
the command centre, agents are chasing us down to five.
any other footage?
follow her.
the nearest armed unit is five minutes away.
the helicopter's 00 miles away.
barriers?
in position.
the other side of the tunnel is the last intersection.
they have nowhere to go.
sco00 is five minutes away.
go.
lead two, report.
ed, wait.
lead two, report.
i repeat, the cia liaison officer has been shot.
agent 0, do you see qasim?
control, i hear a vehicle.
they shut everything down.
it's over.
the bbc can confirm that the american terrorist leader adam qasim has escaped from mi0 custody in one of the most serious mistakes in the history of the organization.
apparently, the security convoy transporting qasim was attacked on the raf northolt route.
you call it murder, not war, but in the west streets.
because in new york, in washington, you didn't want it in london.
but he didn't want the kids in pakistan either.
when they get shot by drone airplanes, they call it murder.
qasim offers a new kind of threat.
so far, he hasn't targeted civilians.
our models show a 00% chance of an attack within 00 hours.
the more pressure he gets under, the smaller the window.
i can't say that with the tape recorder i was...
the secretary of state is coming tomorrow.
we serve the british people, not washington.
if that's not true, we're already done.
_
we need a head.
i'll be suspended in the morning.
you never heard of qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, what happens to me if you get out?
you're out, too.
_
just go.
will holloway?
go.
how's life after mi0?
you're not from the moscow branch.
london needs you.
is there anyone you should say goodbye to?
thank you.
we know harry's connection to your family, so we understand this may not be easy for you.
it doesn't matter if he's dead.
harry's too arrogant to kill himself.
he was acting like he was going to kill himself.
she went to her grave.
love of your life.
harry's team has noticed changes in harry's attitude since the woman died.
emotionally, it's cold, he's started drinking heavily.
the water would be below two degrees.
he'd have hypothermia before he got to the bank.
this is the picture you said it was taken after you jumped into the land.
before he disappeared, harry made four encrypted phone calls.
_
why did she call you?
i have no idea.
the last time i spoke to him was when he got me on mi0 duty three years ago.
she wants to talk right now.
that makes you useful.
can you help us find her?
no, thanks.
and you, harry, do you talk a lot about berlin?
the night your father died?
if there's anything else, mace, i have a right to know.
i don't think i can decide that...
i think you told me what you wanted to tell me if you weren't really gonna kill him.
find harry, so you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
i thought i was taking this title to the grave.
recently, head of anti-terrorist for her majesty's security service.
funny, but who are you really?
it's someone who knows what these two words mean to you.
asma shishani.
go.
how did you find me?
what do you want?
i know someone did it on my side.
they never told me who they were.
of course not, but you must have a connection.
a phone number, that's all.
the phone number'll work, too.
in return, i'll give you what you want.
impossible.
she said she was a human rights lawyer.
your government helped them after they put my two brothers in jail.
but after i was released, she became too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if she's a spy, she's not one of us.
then tell her it's okay, but it's not worth anything to you.
keep her alive, she's the guarantee i'll keep my word.
i don't need a guarantee.
take her to a hospital, or the deal's off!
what she needs is mercy.
no!
she has a daughter.
and you sent him after me?
you put him in danger and now you deny saving him from pain?
what kind of man are you?
don't send the video to her parents.
harry... harry... harry... harry harry
you have a deal.
the bbc understands there is no progress on the arrest of the escaped terrorist adam qasim.
the national threat level has gone critical, so there's an attack on the eli tower.
in the news of the economy, the ftse 000 fell again this morning, and sterlin continued to breathe the dollar, euros, other funds.
there's a new intel on harry.
he's got a motorcycle line we tracked down to kent coast.
holloway, this is classified information.
we also found traces of explosives there.
you've known him longer than any of us.
do you think it's possible that qasim somehow got harry involved?
take her with you?
i don't know.
anyway, you find harry, we find qasim.
anything for holloway?
here you go.
tomorrow, 00.
"dupa 0, a knee a, park at 0am."
then, open your eyes four.
i hope you come alone.
just for protection.
if you can't bring a crazy cold war geek without shooting, we're seriously in trouble.
i promise.
it says not yet.
we're playing this game through harry's way until we see him.
copy that.
doors opening.
go.
ground floor.
doors opening.
open visions, multiple exits.
repeat, holloway.
the things harry needed for a meeting to set up.
yes, mr. holloway, your uncle said he'd meet you at the coffee shop.
she left her cell phone at home.
the guy in the parking lot, get rid of him.
she'd wear an mi0 shirt.
listen to me.
stop underestimating harry.
don't think he's going to endanger your men.
wait for the signal...
what is it, alpha 0?
holloway?
holloway, where are you going?
wait.
no, there's no pattern.
don't move.
holloway, don't move!
terminal 0b.
doors closing.
she booked me a flight.
pa000, douglasow flight.
i'm going to glow's.
call the douglasow office.
get me the airport police.
priority code sigma nine.
police want a clear path to the terminal.
and get us clearance for heathrow security.
the passengers are...
holloway, don't go in the airside.
what am i doing here, harry?
i had to find someone outside the service i could trust.
it's a short list when you go drunk, crazy and dead.
to be honest, the only person i can call a friend is someone who thinks i ruined your life.
qasim's escape was arranged by someone at the top of the service.
by one of the people who asked you to follow me.
that's why i had to disappear.
you had qasim.
he's our only connection to the traitor.
once it's in the system, it'll be shut.
he's planning an attack.
someone's trying to destroy themselves.
you're crazy.
ruth's death...
don't!
look at yourself, that's all i want.
what are you waiting for, harry?
mi0 was everything i had and you took it from me, for nothing.
hate me all you want, but i think you believe in the service.
what happened in berlin?
did they trick you like that?
this might not end up like you expected.
i'm afraid i have to tell them that there's something in the lining of your jacket.
nothing there, but they'll have to check it out.
i'll send you a number.
call me in 00 hours, please.
i am security services.
hands behind your back!
you just let him go.
calm down, francis.
we don't want you to have a heart attack.
the deadly one.
mi0 seems like a complete liability right now, and i'm the last friend of mi0.
so you need to be really good to me right now.
in other words, is he crazy?
it's not contradictable with his last three psychological evaluations.
she refused to join.
harry pearce hasn't stopped being.
as crazy as it may be, i'll still catch him...
like, for example.
she asked me to help her disappear.
you didn't think to admit what you wanted and bring him to us?
just because your life hasn't been shit since harry kicked you out doesn't mean you don't think we can't make your life miserable right now.
since we're threatening each other, all three of you, don't fall for the blood you're not swinging.
your entire organization seems to be disposed of right now.
find qasim.
fully loaded.
they're ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i saw this name working on a case.
i thought they were relieving you.
they took it.
now what really happened?
the kidnapping may have been arranged by someone in the service.
do you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i left it two weeks ago.
there must be one around here.
tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't apply.
when i was 00 years old, i was hanging out with a kid who made the money transfer.
k section was interested in some of the people using it, so they got to me.
you started as an agent?
and when i was done, they asked me to be trained as an officer.
when i told you, my parents returned to me.
and if someone you worked for helped qasim escape, that would be a problem, wouldn't it?
all right.
something felt wrong that day.
robass, my team leader, he was in front with me.
he told me not to open the weapons compartment.
he ordered me to chase him.
where does she live?
it's loaded.
w00.
panama city.
the service fund.
june, what are you...
who are you?
you told me not to chase qasim.
you told me not to chase when i treated my gun.
we took a oath, rob.
i'm not saying anything until we get to thames house.
we're not going to thames house thames house thames house thames
will, what did you find?
qasim's guards were deliberately weakened.
the team leader was in on it.
she's just a shoemaker.
find out who gave the order.
the americans think mi0 is a weak link, and i think one of them is joining them.
when qas escaped, we fell out of sight.
the cia has taken it completely.
fire... fire... fire... fire...
he was gonna shoot.
pulse pulse...
dead, dead.
he's dead.
listen.
you should go home.
june!
i'll take care of this, but you have to go, now.
i never heard of a piece murdered with a song like that.
who's warrender's dirty shot?
landon miller.
agency hawk.
he's trying to secure his continued support, hoping not to give him the keys to the kingdom.
every time i see you, francis, you seem to be buried another inch or two deeper in the recesses of some swivel-eyed cow from langley or the pentagon.
you don't have to tell me.
i think at times like these, we shouldn't forget whose flag was released.
francis.
i'm trying to help, but he's officially accusing me of doing business for the cia.
tonight, your generals, your politicians, your spies met for a celebration.
tonight, we strike at the heart of your powers.
our enemy, your sons and daughters, the politicians who lead you to death in illegal wars.
spies who spy on you like you are criminals.
this war is beyond religious differences.
all flights out of the kingdom of the united kingdom from the united kingdom...
she had it.
warrender lived.
if you have a way to get to qasim, tell me now.
there's another way.
qasim's wife.
asma shishani.
the fsb has her.
if i find out where they're holding her, she gives the traitor.
you made a deal with her.
yeah.
and if we succeed, it will lead us right to him.
surrender and set it up.
how do you know the russians have women?
in exchange for an expired cia agent trapped in moscow.
i can get you away, but you need to open the secret door.
this is an ip address.
you're kidding.
it's the only way, will.
harry's getting help somewhere.
i've cleared your old contacts, but i need access to personnel files to do it properly.
but it still doesn't take you anywhere exciting.
in position.
looks like i'm gonna have to steal more extra bandwidth.
the drink.
malcolm?
all right, i'm in.
i'm looking at the servers now.
harry, we gotta go.
can't we do this faster?
i can do it.
but unfortunately, this machine is from a century ago.
g branch already pulled these.
erin watts.
might be worth a closer look.
fill in the blanks for me.
but i've been exposed to an agent.
i almost got him out.
i was a colleague less than a year.
they're making you choose sooner or later.
all right, i'll leave you in peace.
is it?
why am i sure?
i'm sorry, will.
harry.
harry!
harry, what did you do?
stay away from the computer.
i didn't feel the need to say this before, but i hope you know what you're doing.
harry works with qasim?
he stole an entire gchq data archive.
everything we have on our west agent friends in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
she appeared on the schreffeld airport cctv.
i don't know.
harry didn't attack that cyber on his own.
then who's helping him?
except you.
and you still protect her.
why?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i'll find him.
and there's a threat.
according to analysis, there'll be a large-scale attack within 00 hours, multiple targets.
an agent in charge of qasim's escape is missing.
there are signs of struggle in her house.
do you know anything about that?
how's your mother, holloway?
i hear it's not very good.
he hasn't packed since your dad died.
understandable, but really.
and then that door work comes.
i know, i know.
harry was right about one thing.
you're not good enough.
home secretary, can we really hope that qasim will stop attacking again?
we have destroyed the threats of our freedom and the way we live.
your ability to hurt us may be important, but it's the end.
you'll find out we don't have boundaries.
they won't listen.
they never killed our women?
we're making the world a better place, brother.
the transplant team is in position at the airport.
we have a warrant by the arc to block the road to the prisoner if necessary.
i guess i owe you one.
you were totally right about vass.
danke.
alexanderplatz.
northeast corner by the subway, 00:00 am.
we have a safe house.
call it nostalgia.
don't forget to bring the archive.
don't forget to bring his wife.
how did you find me?
there's only one place in berlin to interview.
you told me.
northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
no emotionality.
it's the price of qasim's wife.
when she gets out of fsb custody, qasim will give me a number.
and he'll take me to the renegade.
they'll destroy the service where it can be defended.
get in the car, harry.
there's an old hotel 00 minutes away.
my contact can meet us there with 0 clean passports for me.
you're going home.
i'm sorry about that.
why are you here, mrs. keaton?
keep moving, harry.
i killed someone because of you.
you're c0, aren't you?
what are you doing, harry?
