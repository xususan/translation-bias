michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, the one he shared his bed was his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i will.
i need to write a letter of at least 000 words... about the morality of war and the possibility of a conflict.
i'm not sure the morality teacher would like me to cheat while writing a trial.
then you passed my moral test.
in fact, it was hopeless to her teacher, who had hopelessly burned her sister, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact,
even the hands of small crimes can be severely cut off.
no ring no ring
try to remember everything he said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
you have to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
we had the eye on us.
your father thought it would make us more charitable.
he must have imitated my signature.
one year ago, i'd have a son who'd finished his cheese!
you've got to get me out of
i'll call social services, but you need to get buster back.
but i can't take care of him
i don't have a mother's compassion and milk anymore
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
it's a couple of fun girls
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yes.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
by the way, lindsay was doing her homework with george michael.
why do i tell you that?
i guess there are some things that a man can't tell his father
lindsay thought george michael was trying to set up his teacher's father... to get her to do her motherfucking duty.
there's nothing wrong with that.
however, i must express to you that i'm a little broken because you don't think of me for it.
the aunt can carry out this mission.
the teachers can carry out this mission.
one day, you will find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay was never so proud of what she said in her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i keep telling you about.
girl, really... young girl.
your appointment, nazh... your appointment, your
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma, you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache
yeah.
but gob misunderstood the sentiment that michael was being treated in kindness... and felt that he was fighting to interfere.
because, you know, beyond love... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
_
and george sr was about to come to a surprise visit.
i've read all your teachings and i've taken all your tapes.
and i watched them all again.
george s.r. has recently released a series of tapes... that he's been selling to the people, to make money from the new spirituality he just discovered.
i also lost two kilos to eat your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to find out where
this is a good place to start.
and after michael got rid of the two girls he was on a date with, lindsay and her parents met her at midnight.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this monster room have the same plan as our kitchen floor?
i think he's very good for you.
i thought it would make her think of her motherhood.
besides, i can't rush in and marry someone just because my son wants to.
i'm miss baerly, the morality teacher
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life... that there is no way to be able to stand by an indiscreet
and michael is getting to know his son's morality teacher.
that's what this is like.
you know, it's so annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you laughed.
"rrrrrrrrr! "rrrrr
but, you know,
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite a drink?
or... or...
yeah, he's dead
i think it's because of this mr. daniels paralysis disaster incident.
let's go have a drink.
yeah, maybe it helps.
george sr was dealing with his own admirer.
i've already told you many sins.
maybe you could tell me a few sins.
well, there are legal demonstrations that show my sins.
but, back to your sins.
tell me about one of those things that happened about that thing... that happened again in college.
and what happened to his meeting with mrs. bayerly, the second date michael had today's date
michael, that little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it's him.
you're gonna have to rob her to freeze her to say something
yes, mother.
they'll take him back.
don't take your shoes off, little mister!
don't take your shoes off!
he's out of
who is it?
it's "annong, your father and i adopted him.
what, i've been going for a few days and you find a new son?
lucille realized buster was worried, even jealous.
and she knew how it felt to be ignored.
annyong is now your brother's your
cancel it.
he's stay
listen, i'll call you back later.
nice driving.
having dinner reservations?
" he's made a prostitute korean
and after their meetings.....
michael took a step he hadn't thrown
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a very good idea
but how are we gonna infiltrate inside without making everyone awake
this may not be the best idea i've ever had.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i loved.
i got someone you love.
" i don'tbashbaubernashbaujam
listen, i know you're trying to get revenge on marta.
i was lying to you when i told you i wasn't gonna try to sleep with her, so
he has to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i really have a chance of getting rid of it.
no problem.
so romantic.
who's "n-n-ahden?
hi, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i must say i didn't know it was real first.
but now... now, your morale teacher... is...
yeah, i did it for him.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm sure he's interested in her, you know.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
about his lesson?
i mean, she loves him... my saddam
hi, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
daddy, what was she doing here
michael knew he had an moral obligation to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
uncle gob slept with him.
well, why did he do that?
why did he sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob's new... new...
he's not one of the good snipers who's targeting him, and he'll be shooting
you know, but listen, did you really think he was... the thing?
i mean, you think he's old for you, don't you?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
he was in a different dance with young girls... and i was just going to joke with a joke, and i thought i'd go and do something
" would you like to dance? "
and he's like, i thought he'd be, " what's gonna happen, okay?
i did it differently in the mirror, but...
but, you know, well, we're dancing with a joke or something.
i didn't think so.
don't you think you should date someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've provoked a book that's hard to find a picture of saddam's bath suite.
" what would he do?
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's the same as our fire escape.
in prison, george sr was preparing to spend the night with his most loyal fan.
the one where cindi lightballoon makes his own preparations.
how are we doing?
we got a video.
and while george michael is still mad at gob, he's gone looking for a family expert on creating problems.
i know you're dating shannon.
with that pongpong girl?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, actually, i called mr. daniels, and i asked him about it... but he's breathing and he dropped the phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe we should both go together.
that's right, i mean, it was a bad example... a
hi.
my mother took it.
he's telling me to do school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the condition of george michael with mrs. bearly.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
i want to talk to you about it.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality... about mor
you see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, he's like, he's in love with you, so
he knows we're dating.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most moral thing i've ever heard in my life.
well, you've only been a half-and-a-
look, that was an impromptu move.
my brother was gonna try to sleep with you.
then i want to break up with you right now, and i'm not going back to you.
i understand.
from now on.
he went for a walk with george sr.i.
george.
and she's getting to know him
you can totally spill your guts in here.
it's a weight in my
you, you,
he's covering the camera.
( i'm taking it to the dance, this is your dinner, far away, with my mother.
actually, lucille was taking anny and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy
watch your back, my little brother immigrants!
and the different spice dancing was in the final contact.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting her in because she's not just a perfectly perfect-shaped nose-shaped eye-shaped jaw.
you want to dance?
all right!
he finally found the shannon he called gob... and
gob found out he was cheating on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hi, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i screwed up, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about this for a while, and-and-
it's... it's your right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high-school dance?
i'm only here with my girlfriend.
yeah, with my moral teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my moral teacher.
after being so bad to you, it made me really emotional that you were trying to protect me.
in fact, gob mistook michael's ethics teacher with a citizenship teacher.
man, he... he knows.
gob was the teacher of mrs. whitehead citizenship.
second move.
i was seeing miss baerly, and i shouldn't have mixed up with gob.
but the day you told me you liked him, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with the kids
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed at some sad things, but...
i don't think we're gonna have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm taking this cake.
hey, you want to dance?
i can't believe this is working.
the next plant is in giantelopment.
buster's piss is off.

in the time of the crisis in 0000, when the cost was growing up, the ruthless warden thought of extending his fortune by destroying some expenses
they were prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the director's crimes were exposed.
the last person who was sentenced to death was director harvis himself.
rumor has it that the warden is still walking down the halls.
you will be asked to face the director tonight and the tortured souls under this building.

is that true?
okay.
god!
that sounds great.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't
there's a voice

from what i understand, the people who did this job have cut off our connection to our homo friend to give us a more creepy weather.
whatever.
it certainly did.

i think we've done something awesome.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, man, it's not that bad.
it's definitely not worth the
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.

i guess i can't do it
they can assign you back.
don't joke
i swear you don't even know how you feel in there.
it's like you're walking in a dense fog, just cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it cooler here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next.
what do you mean?
" the cameras aren't working? "
what do you expect me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated
let's send scelzi downstairs and have a look at it.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy
we'll talk or i'll walk or

" you're talking about the local girls you slept with when you're in the infar
am i right?
big lips, large hips, taylor.
okay, the prison isn't just for men
is there a women department?
and that fucking crazy manager roaming around the women's department, never answered anyone.
he beat them, raped them, got them pregnant, and killed them starving.
some say he's feeding his own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this real story will increase interest in the show!
anyone could be talking about us.
it's nothing compared to the fact that you made up.
i think so.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
yeah?
what is it?
anyway, i'll get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they are.
good.
scelzi, what is that?
just a little something to get me out of the night.

the bbc can confirm that one of the most serious mistakes in the history of the american terrorist leader adem qasim's organization has escaped from mi0 cust
apparently, the security convoy transporting the qasim was attacked in the raf north route.
you're saying it's not a war because it's on the
because in new york, in washington, in london, you didn't want it.
but he didn't want the pakistan's kids
when they're hit by drone airplanes, they call it murder.
qasim is offering a new kind of threat.
so far, he hasn't targeted civil
our models show the possibility of an attack within 00 hours.
the more pressure he's under, the smaller the window.
i can't say that when i'm under the tape
the foreign minister is coming tomorrow.
we serve the british people, not washington.
if this isn't true anymore, we're already
the americans think we don't serve the purpose anymore.
we need a bald one.
i'll be off duty in the morning
you hear nothing about the qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, what's gonna happen to me
you take it out.
nobody else knows you're in qasim's network
just go.
will holloway?
go.
how's life after mi0?
you're not from the moscow division.
london needs you.
is there anyone you should say goodbye?
thank you.
we know harry's connection to your family, so we understand that it might not be easy for you.
even if he's dead, it'
harry's too arrogant to kill himself.
he was just trying to kill himself.
he went to this woman's grave
the love of your life
the harry's crew has noticed a change in harry's attitude since she died.
emotionally, it's cold, it's getting a high amount of
the water would be below 0 degrees.
she'd have had hypothermia before she got to the
that's the picture before you went into this land, and that's the one you said was taken after
before she disappeared, harry made three encrypted phone calls.
your old emergency message box.
why did she call you?
i have no idea.
i talked to him the last time he got me from mi0 0 years ago.
he wants to talk right now.
that makes you useful.
can you help us find him?
no, thanks.
and you, harry, can you talk a lot about berlin?
the night your father died?
if there's anything else, mace, i have a right to know.
i don't think i can decide that... that i can dec
if you weren't really gonna kill him, i think you told me what you wanted
find harry so you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
i thought i'd take this title to the grave.
he's the anti-terrorist president of the majesty's security service lately.
funny, but who are you really?
someone who knows what these two words mean to you.
asma shishani.
go.
how did you find me?
what do you want?
i know someone did it on my side.
they never told me who they were.
of course they didn't, but you must have a connection.
it's a phone number, that's
the phone number will work.
in return, i'll give you what you want.
impossible.
he said he was a human rights lawyer.
your government helped them after i put my two brothers in jail.
but after i was released she started to be too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if he's an agent, he's not one
and then, if you don't mind, tell me it's not worth anything to you
keep him alive, it's the guarantee i'll keep my word.
i don't need a guarantee.
take him to a hospital now or the deal is off!
what she needs is mercy.
no!
she's got a
and you sent him after me?
you put him in danger and now you refuse to save him from pain?
how the hell are you?
don't send the video to his family.
harry... harry
you have a deal.
according to the bbc, there's no progress in the fact that the terrorist anem qasim is captured.
the national threat level has become critical, so you have an attack on your hand.
in their economics, ftse 000 fell again this morning and sterling continued to breathe the euros and other funds.
there's a new intel on harry.
he's got a pre-paid line we tracked down to kentucky.
holloway, this is confidential information.
we also found traces of explosives there.
you've known him longer than any of us.
do you think it's possible that the qasim somehow got harry involved?
pulling him with her?
i don't
anyway, you find harry, we're qasim.
anything for holloway?
please.
tomorrow, 00 : 00.
salpa 0, line a, park 0 on 0.
then, open your eyes four.
i hope you come alone.
just for protection.
if you can't bring a crazy cold war morgue without hitting us, we're in serious trouble
i promise.
it says not yet.
we play this game through harry until we see him.
copy that.
doors opening.
go.
the floor floor.
doors opening.
open visions, multiple exits.
repeat, holloway.
what harry needs to set up a meeting.
yes, mr holloway, your uncle said he'd meet you at the coffee shop.
he left his cell phone at home.
the man in the parking lot, get rid of him
he'd be wearing an mi0 t-shirt.
listen to me.
stop underestimating harry.
don't think you're going to risk your men.
wait for him to send a signal...
what happened, alpha 0?
holloway?
holloway, where are you going?
wait.
no, we have no order there.
don't move.
holloway, don't move!
terminal 0b.
doors closing.
he set me up a flight.
pa000, a field plane.
i'm going to go to glasgra.
call the field office.
get me the airport police.
priority code nine.
the police want an open road to the terminal.
and arrange for heathrow's safety.
pa000 is the passengers of the highlow plane... the passengers of
holloway, don't go in the air section
what am i doing here, harry?
i had to find someone i could trust outside the service.
it's a short list when you're drunk and dead.
to be honest, the only person i can say friend is someone who thinks i ruined his life.
qasim's escape was arranged by someone at the top of the service.
by someone who wants you to follow me.
that's why i needed to disappear.
the qasim had it.
he's our only connection to the traitor
when it's in the system, it'll be
he's planning an attack.
someone's trying to destroy themselves.
you're crazy.
ruth's death... death... death
don't
look at you, that's all i want.
what are you waiting for, harry?
mi0 was my everything, and you took it from me, for nothing.
hate me the way you want, but i think you believe in the service.
what happened in berlin?
did they fool you like that?
this may not be the end of it, as you hoped
i'm afraid i have to tell them there's something in the lining of your jack
there's nothing there, but they're gonna have to check it
i'll send you a number.
call me in 00 hours, please.
i'm from security services.
put your hands behind your back!
you just let her go.
easy, francis.
we don't want you to have a heart
it's the deadly one.
mi0 seems to be a complete liability right now, and i'm the last friend of the mi0 government.
so right now you have to be really nice to me.
in other words, is he crazy?
this isn't contradicting his last three psychological
he refused to attend.
he didn't stop being harry pearce, but.
even if he's crazy, i'll still catch him... even
like.
he asked me to help him disappear.
didn't it occur to you to accept your request and bring it to us?
don't think we can't put your life in a shitty position just because harry hasn't kicked you out of work.
since we've threatened each other, the three of you haven't been stuck in a cliff or anything.
your entire organization seems to be suspended right now.
find qasim.
it's full
they're ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i saw that name in a case.
i thought they were taking you off duty.
they took it
now, what really happened?
the abduction could be arranged by someone in the service.
you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i left it 0 weeks ago.
there must be one around here.
tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't apply
when i was 00, i was hanging out with a kid who made money transfers.
the section was interested in some people using it, so they got to me.
you started as an agent?
and when i was done, they asked me to train as an officer.
my parents came back to me when i told them.
and if someone you work for helped get away with qasim, that would be a problem, wouldn't it?
all right.
something felt wrong that day.
rob vass, my team leader, was in front of me.
he told me not to open the weapons compartment.
he ordered me to chase.
where does he live?
it's
w00 account front.
panama city.
service bribe fund.
june, what are you... what are you
who are you?
you told me not to fire qasim.
you told me not to go after my gun.
we made an oath, rob.
i'm not saying anything until i get to thames house.
we're not going to thames house.
will, what did you find?
qasim's bodyguards are weakened.
the team leader was in on it.
he's just a footman
find out who gave the order.
the americans think mi0 is weak link, and i think one of them is joining them.
when qasim escaped, we fell out of sight.
the cia's got it all in
fire... fire
he was gonna shoot
the pulse... pul
he's dead,
he's
listen.
you should go home.
june!
i'll take care of it, but you have to go, now.
i didn't hear a part of a song like that was murdered.
who's the warrender hit the eyelash?
landon miller.
ajp.
he's trying to ensure his continued support, and he's hoping not to give the keys to the kingdom.
every time i see you, francis, langley or the pentagon, you look like you're buried in the secret location of a cow or two more inches.
you don't have to tell me
i don't think we should forget whose flag we have at hand like this.
francis.
i'm trying to help, but he's blaming me for a job for the cia.
tonight, your generals, your politicians, your spies, came together to celebrate.
tonight, we will attack the heart of their power.
our enemy, the politicians who sent your sons and daughters to death in illegal wars.
spies who spy against you like you're guilty.
this war is beyond religious differences.
all the flights that are out of the united kingdom
he had it.
warrender lived.
if you have access to qasim, say it now.
there's another way.
the wife of qasim.
asma shishani.
the woman has the fsb.
if i find out where they're keeping her, she'll give me the traitor
you made a deal with him.
yeah.
and if we succeed, it will lead us straight to him.
surrender and adjust.
how do you know the russians have the russians?
in exchange for a cia spy stuck in moscow.
i can reach the distance but you need to open the secret door.
it's an ip address.
you're kidding.
it's the only way, will
harry's getting help from somewhere.
i've taken your old contacts, but i need access to personnel files to do it properly.
but it won't take you anywhere exciting.
i'm in position.
looks like i'm gonna have to steal more extra band broads.
your drink.
malcolm?
all right, i'm in.
i'm looking at the servers now
harry, we gotta go.
can we do this faster?
i can do it.
but unfortunately, this machine is from the last century.
the g.r. already pulled
erin watts.
it might be worth looking closer.
fill the blanks for me.
but i have an agent exposed.
i almost got him out.
i've been in the business for less than a year.
they make you choose sooner or later.
all right, i'll leave you alone.
is it over?
sure about what?
i'm sorry, will.
harry.
harry!
harry, what have you done?
stay away from the computer.
i didn't feel like i should have said this before, but i hope you know what you're doing.
is harry working with qasim?
he stole an entire gchq data archives.
everything we have on our west agent friends in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
it showed up on the schmeeffield airport cctv.
i don't
harry didn't do that cyber attack on his own.
then who's helping him?
except you.
and you're still protecting him.
why?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i'll find him.
and there's a threat.
according to the analysis, there's gonna be an enormous amount of attack within 00 hours
a spy on qasim's escape is missing.
there are signs of a struggle at home.
you know anything about that?
how's your mother, holloway?
i heard he's not very good.
your father hasn't packed since he died.
understandable, really.
and then that doorbell comes in.
i know, i know.
harry was right about something.
you're not good enough.
the home secretary, can we really hope that the qasim will stop attacking again?
we've destroyed the threat of our freedom and our way of life.
your ability to wound us may be important, but it's the end of
you're gonna find out that our decision is
they don't listen.
they never killed our women?
we're making the world a better place, brother.
there's a transport team at the airport.
we've got a warrant on the atc to shut down the road to the prisoner
i think i owe you one.
you were absolutely right about vass.
danke.
alexanderplatz.
on the northeast corner of the metron, 00th.
we have a safe house.
call it nostalgia.
don't forget to bring the archives
don't forget to bring your wife
how did you find me?
there's only one place in berlin to meet.
you told me.
the northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
no sentimentality.
that's the price of qasim's wife.
when the woman is out of fsb custody, my qasim will give me a number.
he's gonna take me to the tra
they're going to destroy the service at the vulnerable place to take it.
get in the car, harry.
there's an old hotel 00 minutes away.
my contact can meet us there with three clean passports.
you're going home.
i'm sorry about that.
why are you here, miss keaton?
keep moving, harry.
i killed someone because of you.
you're c0, aren't
what are you doing, harry?
talent discovery.
and which one of you found it?
for god's sake, will
preparation is everything.
what about vass?
when he came to my house, i reported
i said someone was asking about the qasim's escape.
they tied me to the command center and they told me what to do.
they went to vass's house before us and planted evidence.
i arranged for vass to escape.
you think i want to do it?
i know my mission.
i'm the only one who kn
you were played.
he's right, will.
but i wonder if miss keaton is sure about me.
it was a secure command chain.
what was i supposed to do?
you believe him?
yeah.
i'm sure your men will come and find you, if you're still useful.
what do you think they're gonna do to you after this is all over
i did what they asked me to do.
we're changing the deal.
we're taking qasim's wife to london.
tell him to come to the exchange, or he'll never see his wife again.
let's go get her.
what happened to alexanderplatz?
sudden agoraphobia.
i'm afraid there was something wrong with qasim's wife
at least work until you put it in my car.
harry.
colonel.
i hate to be unkind, but we're gonna need your clothes.
everyone who's travelling on the national rail line of the united kingdom for adam qasim has to show valid id and access to the governor's control.
i have your wife.
let me talk to him.
the russians made him fall asleep
bullshit.
i'm bringing your wife to london.
no.
i'll tell the bitch you said goodbye.
is the baby thing too much?
no, you're the same.
i trusted june.
you were right to take me on duty.
despite everything i've done, you're still trying to do something good here.
i won't let their sacrifice be in vain.
it was here.
was it quick?
he could have left me, but he chose not to.
if you try anything, anything, i can't guarantee anyone's safety.
no one.
you bring my wife, i'll give you your number.
here we go.
hello?
holloway.
this message came from the h branch.
i.
we can catch qasim, but we need help.
and let's go.
one clean choice, hannah.
trust me, and help me.
or leave.
do well or better, right?
shit.
they're closing in on me.
the algorithm i wrote last night has been upgraded without stopping the self-perpetuating algorithm i've written.
it doesn't cut the water?
please.
all right, here we are.
how much time do we have?
i'm looking at 000 cameras.
give me something.
the moment he realizes we're playing with him,
wait.
he worked 00 seconds ago.
are you sure?
yes, confirmed.
the camera was disabled at the last minute
0th floor, east corner.
harry, we have to.
i have to hope you're looking at us.
yeah?
look at you in the sun.
i have his wife.
you were supposed to look at the south.
give me the number.
give me the number or we'll leave.
turn around now or you die.
here.
that too.
i haven't got him yet.
you got three seconds to turn around.
turn around.
maybe this guy never saw her.
i'm almost there
him?
kill him.
give me the number.
don't
stop!
no!
okay?
will, she's fine.
the shooter's dead.
it's over then.
malcolm, hair.

harry?
hannah, why did harry take off the headph
i don't
let us know.
bring sco00.
three trucks full of rdx, leaving the limehouse north industrial park in the next 00 minutes.
how do you know?
qasim just told me.
in 00 minutes, the bombs are breaking up with heavy trucks
i think we got him.
let's go!
armed police!
stay where you are!
clear!
clear!
the main target?
negative!
negative!
negative, sir.
command post, area clear.
harry.
he sold his own men.
why would he do that?
what did you do?
armed police!
don't move!
move!
you have to tell them everything, harry.
i think we have a lot to talk about.
maybe it's a little out of line.
since the southwest corner of alexanderplatz.
keep an eye on holloway.
make sure you're safe.
maybe we won't be so hasty.
you found qasim?
harry will.
you still don't know him.
qasim gave up his entire operation.
what did you tell him?
i should have thought they'd let you go after berlin.
they want to offer you a deal.
put everything on harry and go.
i told them i'd quit after i did this.
there's no way
i can't
there's an emergency spare key wrapped around his neck.

the opposite.
where you're going to trap someone.
harry?
i gave it to him.

there are 00 men on the other side of these doors.
you must surrender.

i'm the general manager of mi0.
kill me and put the gun down.
otherwise, you're nothing but a dead terrorist.
no one will see you as a hero.
when we're done, you're gonna be a drunk, beatin' his wife, you're gonna be a
we'll give them free disneyland tickets to tell them you're begging for a couple of marrakech male whores and begging them to pee.
we can't remember you very well, can we, adam?
wait, wait, wait.
i pulled the helicopter back.
but... but
you fucking coward.
i thought you were fighting a higher standard.
sorry about your wife's death, adam.
i know what this can do to you.
is that supposed to stop me?
it's
stop!
why did you bring him here?
i made a choice.
without plan b.
why do you think i kept you out of that room?
people are still dead, harry.
less than the ones that will die in the blast.
how can you make such a choice?
it's my job.
auntie g, can you come and play outside?
hi, geraldine.
in the end, it comes to who says the most long lie.
right?
if we had protected that morning, my qasim would never have escaped.
you gave the weather unit an order to reverse all mi0 requests, right?
that's the advantage of being a lonely maniac.
i don't have to prove it
sacrificing his own fortune so he can be absorbed by a foreign power.
no doubt the americans would have made you general manager.
how many more lives was that promotion worth?
what did you think you were doing, harry?
the service is dying
but the moment i realized i was on the loser side, my career would be short.
i blew my brains out, found my 00-year-old nephew...
i think it came from you.
what's this?
his intestine insane for more than two hours or it leads to unstoppable bleeding.
it won't leave a trace.
how clever.
i was afraid that would be the answer.
so i took the chance to choose.
it's not a lunch that makes you sick.
i ate beef ribs too.
tell me you're lying, harry.
please.
tell me you didn't betray your country.
it's been 0 hours, geraldine.
you can spend the last two hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd play with your beautiful nephew.
i'm thinking.
your message said you'd tell me something.
they're watching ruth's grave.
you can't leave now.
i have something that you should be.
your father was wearing this the night he died.
stasi pulled everything that would work out of his body and found a way to get into the fsb archives.
was he wearing a wedding ring on the night of his operation?
i didn't throw you away because you're not good enough.
after your father, i couldn't... after
i should have protected you.
not for ever, will.
then who's gonna take
they're like me
if you know your problem and tell the men at the door, it'll help.
there's room for every guest at the hotel junior high.
gather in one line.
these new problems kill in the darkness.
they'll be grateful to you when these people get dark.
i think we should keep them here to keep them safe, but i'm worried things will get worse.
they have no idea who caused the dark problem.
besides, what we need to worry about is not hidden in the darkness.
we still haven't figured out how to lift this fog wall
maybe it's a blessing.
that's the latest in-flight drive of the pure.
i'm on your side and i might need a new job.
i'm in control, but if i can get another pillow for my beauty sleep, it's gonna be a lot
try to make things right.
we talked about it.
it's almost impossible to destroy someone with a problem without killing him.
yeah, well, i just need the data from which i don't have the tools i don't have and maybe i need information.
i'm gonna need a team
any idea what's going on?
but there's a bad element.
it's the only way to protect the rest of us
it's risky to drive because of the magnet problem.
an engineer to help fix the power plant.
he's volunteered as soon as he knew
if things don't work out, you can use his problem for the plant.
what the hell are you thinking?
the killer who didn't leave a trail is out there some
and i think he wants to prove that he really wants to help you.
okay, so just keep an eye on her for whatever the reason, okay?
because neither of us is immune to new problems.
i'm not saying it's just because
when you're gone, i'll call the person who caused the dark trouble at school.
he stole those batteries and put us in danger.
there was no choice, dwight.
this is the third time in two weeks.
now the serial killer is in this building.
all right, i'm gonna go talk to dwight.
my father always said you were a good man.
mara's father?
it might be a way, but it might seem more frightening if you want me to explain, so don'
i can't even find maine on the map.
you're telling me you can't find a town with 00 thousand population?
there's no problem with that.
then why didn't we use aether in the first place to end the problems?
i can't bring it back when it's sealed.
so how do we find it?
gloria brought a box full of stuff that duke left in gull.
i don't think william has the amount of aether i need, and aether is just a phase one.
you told his wife you'd find him.
it's easy to decide on the sidelines, but sometimes
i have a town to protect.
no wonder the plant works at 00 % rate.
guys, i'll try, but i've never done anything like this before.
they parked the car here so i could talk to you, but i don't have enough money to pay for oil change.
i'll be back with aether before the sun goes well.
that's peggy's husband, rolf.
there's enough panic and fear.
the same killer that killed my son 00 years ago?
" we're calling him the killer who didn't leave a tra
what else are you hiding from me, vince?
dwight's doing everything he can to get the rules, but he's not the one who's gonna
in this haven, exile is the same as executing.
thanks to our friend there, we're keeping them in some kind of prison.
he says the generator works at 00 %.
damn, the generator must have emptied their energy reserves when it overloaded.
that explains the part in town was given an electrical charge.
if it's going fast, it's, like,
this is about to end, and it's the only thing that protects us from dying
here, i've reconfigured the generator's arrangements to get power to town faster, but there's nothing else we can do.
they'd better come back.
help each other.
turn around the lamps.
share your supplies.
you'll understand, i'm happy here
i got your message.
get in the car now.
come on, jump!
if the war lies ahead, we should be grateful, not with you.
i don't think you have anything worse than falling in love.
i don't like it here.
every story has two sides.
whoever's behind this is a traitor.
let's go.
he asked me to represent him at slean's wedding.
you're my brother's love.
that's why you're like a brother
you've seen bigger places in iraqi realms than here.
none of them were led by a woman, but.
you must choose a second one to escort you and watch your interests during the month.
then you'll hear the bonds of your friends and relatives.
i don't have any rel
my mother and others will join you.
kela, this is the palace of bregan.
does rheda always have to protect me?
i don't get it.
but i know i have to marry slean.
i'll love him.
this marriage cannot be fulfilled.
abrecan trusts you.
what do you do?
carpenter.
they can use you on the wall, then.
who are you?
he was a friend of the council president.
like i said, i have some business to attend to.
we need to figure out how to handle it.
varr said i couldn't accept a gift.
then we'll stay together.
every bride should smell nice when it's
remember, it's our secret.
sit down.
we'll take what we'll get when we look at the wounded.
you wanted to talk?
all right.
kela, it's time for the month.
elvina, are you gonna be the second person next to me?
for the game.
we need to talk sometime.
we need to discuss why marriage doesn't work.
if we don't fulfill our mission, their marriages
beowf!
let's celebrate.
for old traditions!
smells like a dress.
i'm so sorry.
it was just a mistake.
that's all
we'll help slean give the symbol to his bride.
sounds easy.
breca!
open the door!
come on, you stinking mudborn.
come on!
come on!
give me your arm.
come on!
slean.
quiet, she's asleep.
are they ready for this marriage?
i don't understand the reason that slean didn't want to marry kela.
i don't think so.
he must put aside his feelings and do what's best for everyone.
would you put what you wanted aside for others?
that's what we all have to do.
if someone spends their whole life satisfying others, it's actually not a person.
thinking like that makes you feel pretty free.
try it.
tell every rock the truth.
but then you can look at each other and burn the fire that symbolizes your marriage.
then you'll be husband and wife.
have you loved someone before?
no.
before we get here... you... before you
you want to be a shane?
tell my uncle i'm done with him.
yeah.
come on!
go!
you let him go.
we're not done here.
don't you understand?
i betrayed my mother and set up a pussy with my uncle.
this woman was sent here to kill you!
i don't
was it?
i killed my brother.
she's the one she was supposed to be
even if the earth was gone, mara had everything.
people loved him because he was kind.
my daddy loved him because he was his first
rowan and his lovers.
then i had the chance to escape from there.
i wouldn't need anything.
he died of a fever, but he
he was getting better.
i poisoned her.
slean, i'm not telling anyone what you're doing here today and what'
or stay.
i know, but it's beowulf's.
he went into bed last night.
but we can choose who to draw our fate with.
light the fire with me.
you want to be a shane?
i can help you.
against those who oppose you.
they can't take it from you anymore, rheda.
you're with this marriage, you're the shieldlands j. earl.
the rules of jarl must be used by every tribe.
if the blood isn't paid, a killer's life will be
the thieves will be damned and out of society.
the price of all the merchandise in shieldlands will be located by j. earl.
what's the right to determine the price of fish?
we're the ones who risked their lives to catch every last summer, but.
you should have told me about these rules.
you were where your people needed you most, you were on duty.
i couldn't distract you
it was messy enough.
you're late for the antidote.
some think you missed him again.
but if you fail, bregan will be miserable, and she will open the winter.
breca's wanted for murder, you know that.
kill him!
kill breca now!
i got it!
if you do that without any explanation, we're all dead
he hired us to deliver breca to his blood after he escaped the gallows.
did we ask the guy who helped him escape the first time?
that's why we're gonna welcome
but we have to keep breca.
while we're talking, heorot could be breaking through our doors!
what time did we kill young women?
what do you mean?
you've been hiding in the shadows too long, abre
don't forget who you're talking
speak.
he wants breca's life or blood money for his brother's murder.
i didn't mean to kill anyone.
hurry!
thank you.
breca loved my mother.
he's looking for the shit he thinks he's got money, then he's stealing the money and he's
she left my mother and took everything precious with her.
my brother went after him.
but it cost your life.
breca, is that true?
i'll pay the boy's blood money.
lila, do you have 00 silver coins?
i don't want money, i want blood
silence!
if the blood is paid, breca will be released.
you lied to me.
pandiri.
pandiri!
tie him up now.
get ready, they're coming.
i saw it.
get out!
the council has gathered
he wants to take my place when he's hiding the antidote from my hand.
you let me down, he married sleeping keela, it was rheda jar!
you don't understand
tell the council that our enemies are gathering, that your sister cannot rule, that you want to save shields.
so tell me you're distracted.
say it.
i'm sorry
i knew breca had killed someone, but the story she told me was different.
it's only his fault.
lila, nobody's gonna think bad things about you
that's all i have.
did you bring it?
there aren't 00 silver
it's not
i'll hold breca when i see that.
was there enough money?
lila?
please turn it off.
you won't talk to lila.
get on your horse, abandon heorot and never come back.
there's no place for you here any
i want to fight properly if heorot is being attacked.
if heorot will be attacked, i will protect you.
let's try it
it's not about mudborn.
i don't want to talk about it
i want to know why you lied about training me.
when you use it, it's a keb
you don't even want to be denial.
yeah?
i didn't know we were training the blacksmiths!
go.
now!
he's fighting girls now?
the view was more like the blacksmith was training the talc.
i know you think i let you down.
i can't focus on my duties in bregan.
but i have reasons.
you're talking about betraying someone in your own blood.
we need a warrior in the center of this land!
someone who's gonna get your people out of
a man in power to control the control!
you're talking about treating your sister to conceal the fact that you can't afford your people's needs.
what's the point of having fish if we're all gonna be slaughtered
i'm here to vote insecurity for our thane.
the ones against abrecan being a shane.
it's been
it's gonna be a new shane, and it'll be

no one.
don't think it's a
we got lazy, we got distracted.
that's where it's gonna be
from now on, we're gonna work like my daddy hrothgar.
i didn't mean to interrupt
you're a good teacher.
a great thane wants a strong army behind it.
we don't have to share the same bed, but if we don't share the same room, people will
i always liked watching heorot from here.
it seems so invincible.
i'll lose faith if i tell my mother the truth.
and my chance to rule one day.
what if abrecan attacks?
heorot could fall.
aren't you going to recommend it?
i trust you.
your decision will be right.
i'll be there when i do it.
you're gonna be a
you just have to believe it.
pandiri.
pandiri!
it's pandiri
steal the horn!
i order you, steal the horn!
abrecan, stop it.
if we don't act now, we'll get the chance
why... why
you help me with the network.
help me with the network.
why don't you help me?
pandiri!
come on, hurry up!
go find me a sack.
people shouldn't leave their valuables in place.
you owe my mother an apology.
but i'm a warrior and our honor is at stake
that's why i'm going to hur
go back to your mother, little girl.
greetings.
i didn't need your help.
because he didn't have enough to save you.
be thankful you didn't kill him, vishka
if we don't plant the cries, our prey will be
no, he won't.
stand by.
abrecan, no!
hold still!
hurry, they'll eat you alive!
pandiri, pandiri!
pandiri, pandiri!
hold on!
now get nervous!
check it out.
there are songs about this hunt.
it's a catch you won.
i have a dream about us.
to be the biggest tribe in shieldlands!
we're not going to follow the law that a j earl can't even hold a sword.
who's with me?
abrecan, abrecan, abrecan, abre
i need to warn beowf.
bregan!
elvina!
their warriors are coming together.
this time their intentions will destroy us.
beowf!
if we look around today, we'll see more danger and harm come from religious beliefs.
my wife would be less embarrassed if i talked about soviet communism or stalin's brutality in my stand-up demonstrations.
it's the kind of interrogating questioning people's issues, especially the philosophy.
to present a perfectly correct situation within itself, could cause serious damage.
when the prophecy doesn't happen, we make fun of those people, and the whole world makes fun of us.
i thought richard dawkins and i had a friendly opinion due to this problem.
maybe we should be more aggressive with richard.
especially when america is surrounded by christian faith.
they're sure the world is what their religion says.
we'll get rid of the bad gu
i'd like to write a book like that, if i could.
but of course one of my fears, what happens next.
what kind of mess?
how true is it to people who think that religion is protecting civilization and the good in us, and how good is it?
religion is like moral viagra to many people.
if that's true, if religion is leading people's moral lives, anybody is going to step out of the way, and it's gonna take some seriously, and it's gonna take us all the hell out of business.
because a lot of people are left down there, and we can create a chaos from fear of these people.
a lot of people want their lives to mean something, and where is this coming from?
but something better than religion.
yeah, there's definitely hope.
let's see what happens?
of course.
at least you didn't make piercing.
i don't know how to explain this to amy.
i'm the dumbest man in
all right, no more.
i'm the dumbest man in
all right, you won this.
i can't find emma's papers.
honey, just so you know, if you find the truth of the receipt, you can't return the baby.
when angela leaves the emma on my door, i need to find the paper she signed and gave me.
i'm finally gonna get me a health insurance policy for what i'm responsible for and
i haven't talked to her since the night we made emma.
calm down.
you gave me all the important paperwork about the baby to keep them safe.
you have all the papers?
daddy's little girl has become his
it could be a balloon thing.
it looks so good!
you rob a clown?
it's your birthday!
first, my birthday is tomorrow.
you used to party all the time when you
after celebrating my birthday...
♪ old-muty birthday mil
you know those papers i've been hiding for me?
how irresponsible do you think i am?
but i'm
i may not have been able to mail them in time, and i may not have been the only owner of emma's attorney.
we were all excited about the new baby, and i didn't have a stamp!
look, we're not gonna have to ask angela to sign this document again.
you're the only one who saw ben's best friend and the girl... because you're the
i love it, all right.
all right, emma's finally asleep
look, danny, what's the reason riley didn't want to celebrate her birthday?
seriously, why does he hate it so much
ben, riley did not celebrate her birthday after her 00 years old party.
you sure you want to watch this?
i think i'd remember if it was a disaster.
all right, come on, everybody.
danny, where are we going?
luckily for the future, you won a real mustache and he's lost weight of personal weight.
is ben here?
benjamin wheeler, come here and celebrate the birthday of riley.
all right, i can tell you this is my best birthday ever.
tell the cake you didn't do anything.
actually, try to save it with the perm first and then cut it out.
is riley still in love with ben, or is that something that happened when she was a kid?
unless you're still in love with riley.
i've disgraced the girl's spoiled 00 years old party
it's not their birthday, but the rest of the time he loves you
if ben's too irresponsible to lose the papers and he's so scared to face me, maybe he doesn't deserve to take emma's deputy away alone.
if it makes you feel better, we do most of the work.
i can imagine how hard it is to let emma go.
i knew you'd eventually hurt her if you thought it was funny or wonderful!
in your presence in the streets of the city, the elite tank unit of the american military unit, only three minutes left with sveive trooper trooper 00
and as madox-00, the weapons we're aware of as limited combat capabilities are extremely high.
what's more, a uh-00 has more than blackhawk.
the anti-terrorist and the anti-gerilla operations.
mrs. vomumoto is the chief architect of the software that is prepared for "ankbuster. "
in the name of putting madox's talents in power today's demonstration, the pilot himself is in the cabin.
unit 0 will go to ichigaya tonight.
we're in a hurry, look at it as soon as we can.
and... ha ha ha
miss vomumoto today, you have made me very small.
i'm not here for congratulations
there's only one thing i'm gonna tell
wow!

what's that?
tenose, you leave this to me!
they just threw their trash away.
don't worry about it.
i'll buy you dinner in return, won't i?
sdf's transport transport vehicle..........
according to the reports, it was perfectly natural to face this incident
obvious terrorist business.
you're too stranger to the eastern-blood operations.
i hope you know what you're saying!
i hope you see the obligation of the incident is entirely yours.
in any case, the situation we're in is critical.
we had him transferred to the field test!
it's out of
i have to be in the operation.
besides, madox-00 is being overwhelmed right now.
while we're investigating the crime scene, the vehicles around the perimeter
should we get backup from the police on the phone?
we need to prepare ourselves for the worst of all, and keep them together.
i'm the only one who can stand in front of madox and confront him.
although lieutenant kilgore is one of the " hapus "... he's the best tanker in the army.
is that okay with b-p?
nobody in the apartment?
anyway, i'm a little relieved.
shiori's really pretty girl... damn
when he's going to read england, all the boys in japan will mourn.
where did you learn that?
he called me in the morning and asked me to give you a message.
use the opener to open it.
it's burning!
the pilot was able to adjust his cabin.
it feels like a boot for ski.
we've got an activation signal from madox.
it's a disaster.
could you have warmed the microwave?
i've really made a mess of myself!
shiori, what do you intend to do
defense forces?
you're on a mission with the tank tank tanker.
don't you dare turn tokyo into vietnam!
tokyo ha vietnam is the same battlefield for me.
you'll cause the disaster.
oh, don't worry about unnecessary
i'll get over it before i get too worked up.
lieutenant kilgore is using his most sophisticated tank and anti-tank helicopter... my word is that he's up to madox's "gier duty.
in this case, the big panic will happen in the
in these circumstances, there must be someone who can stop kilgore and madox.
what can we do?
we don't know madox's target yet.
if i can manage to find him before lieutenant kilgore, then maybe i'll have a chance.
but the madox's condition... is
i'm gonna use the unit #0 with a success of power tests.
how much luck is it?
hey, you heard me!
wait for me.
that's it!
how's it going!

they're all over me!

they damaged my legs.
i can't move anymore

you were fine when we were fighting.

you sell drugs at the bar, right?
either you or your stupid brother took my gun and i need it.
you've got 0 hours to get my gun back or i'm gonna blow people's houses
i'm leaving.
it always breaks things, doesn't it?
why are you bringing this bitch to my place when my wife is upstairs?
what's going on?
he had problems with a solid russian mob who was in trouble all over the place.
he thought they'd kill the baby.
so he left the baby on the train.
now, take this money, and i'll give it to you when i meet the rest of it with ed.
it's not a trick, vince, and you know it!
you don't understand when you don't have a dick in your mouth
there's no problem with your fucking dick in my mouth
no, he said your dick was in his mouth.
i'm not giving them the baby!
they can't get it either!
take it easy, okay?
now get upstairs and get that baby!
over here!

they might not let you go because you have no family.
what flowers would you like, any suggestions?
white roses are good, aren't they
fuck you then!
fuck you!
are you the owner of this vehicle?
but you stopped me for nothing.
but first, let's raise our glasses to chester, the new owner of the show.
chestera.
hopefully, he'll be trembling on these wonderful monsters like i've done for many years.
cheers.
i promise i'll increase the standards of this show and you'll be proud.
bon voyage to where dreams come true.
thank goodness.
even though it's gonna be a hundred-faced german, it's up
marjorie, it's so rude...
thank you, chester.
now, if you'll excuse me, the real family, monsters and the weirdle community will spend their last moment alone.
bye.
there's someone else to thank.
mr. richard spencer.
our lives have completely changed its course.
cheers.
mm!
but we're gonna have a nice feast tonight, and then we're gonna watch a movie from my own collection.
not the sign of the cross again.
no.
we'll watch freaks tonight.
you know this movie, richard?
i can't say i know.
it's a great movie.
tell me about it, eve, paul.
oh.
cleopatra is a natural-generation trapeze artist, and she marries a little dwarf who makes tiny shows.
but his real purpose is to poison him and to his legacy.
every freak has to play his finger until one day he's too drunk and he's out of his mouth, and he's gonna
then all the freaks turn against him.
one night they get revenge on knives and guns.
home, eve.
honey... don't tell me the end of it and miss your taste.
sounds great!
there's a lot to do before it's heading west.
i can't
shut up and sit down.
you earned it.
what happened to you?
come on, richard, open it.
i've been thinking about you for a long time doing
oh, thank god.
we've had some dumb clients seeing our show before, but... no one ever loved it.
you all right, ma'am?
where are those security guards?
good to know.
now it's your turn.
jesus christ.
i don't even know that.
i've already told them everything... and i
stanley.
elsa... el
come on... come on

hollywood!
i'm afraid they're all like you
it's just
come on, turn it over.
aah!

my cousin works from the garden of god.
but you brought death here... and you have to pay for it.
put it down.
come on, come on.
elsa, come on... we need to talk privately.
i believe we can find a common point.
you think you can run now?
i'm telling the truth.
he killed him.
he's not who you think he is.
and start running.
run!
run!
run!
just because your father grew up doesn't need to make it romantic right now that he's dead.
how did he die
who killed him?
we all did.
he broke the rule.
now.
come on.
he was my father!
he killed a freak!
and the most delicate of us.
you believe his word?
this crooked bitch?
i saw dear ma petite in a jar with my own eyes.
i've heard you're wasting it on my own ears.
if maggie hadn't helped us, we'd have more bodies.
i won't forgive him.
all i want is to rot in hell.
in this case, you'll be friends with whoever'
maggie's gonna change her bandages.
no!
keep the dirty ones.
now that your mother isn't here, she's been protecting you and c
i've seen you become a man from childhood to man, a leader and we need you.
i don't have my hands
i can't even do it alone.
i've reached an old friend of mine.
he'll come and help you.
he's a real artist.
but first the wounds need to heal.
maggie will help you.
let him.
i'm so sorry.
i hate hurting you.
really?
i thought your only talent was to hurt people.
i love you, jimmy.
this part is real.
i always have.
i want to start a new beginning.
we can still go to new york like we planned.
why not?
you're kidding, right?
you think after all you've done, we're just going to sail to the new little ones?
my hands... are in a fucking jar, and you're responsible for all this.
i'm so sorry.
can you bring ma petite back from the dead?
huh?
i've changed, jimmy.
ah!
i knew you were stupid, so let's add blindness to your list, shall we?
find someone to focus on the lamp!
i can't leave here.
i need to get the proper light for the first time, you understand?
try it again!
scheissa!
elsa.
of course.
he's watching us.
can't we?
