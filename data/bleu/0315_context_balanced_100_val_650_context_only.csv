" she'll be so fun! "
i wrote this, princess!
she's dead.
i didn't realise i had to answer her.
of course you had to.
look, if you want to hear the truth, i'm ashamed of that list.
and you went and wrote her every feeling and sent it all to the school.
she doesn't have pictures or id numbers.
it's done.
these kids from work school think that when they work for a week, they think she's worth $000,000.

we can change that.
now, our transplant plan in our division, she looks like our intolerant plan, but she's not satisfied.
i didn't know she had information about something like that.
we're just gonna get the company and then we're gonna end her activity.
is this your job?
you buy companies, then you close her up?
she's on a worthy field near the factory near the sea.
so we're taking the factory, close, then... then we take the money to the paravian company, then sell the land, then sell the land.

she wants her life back.
look at me or... see the old man she's looking at and see.
she's not very good.
i love her there.
she's a real family.
because i love her power.
