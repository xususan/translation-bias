you have no idea how great it would be to marry you guess you'll even guess how good it must be
if i had the chance to start everything over again, believe me, believe
i've come with s friendly feelings.
i know i lost my chance.
i'm not half the man you deserve.

"dandy, what do you have to do to support these loved girls?"

i want to make this generation drive.

how's that cloning coming?
very impressive very impressive very
we're getting eggs from the data transmitters we inject injected with intestate drugs injecting
we're getting a cell, this cindy stoller, we're taking a cell.
this part is very impressive so impressive
the witness once said that it was impressive before.
just this part impressive?
then we move the core of each egg with a needle at a needle
there's a lot more than the needle in cllon
we're gonna have the dna extracted eggs next to the donor cell next to the
so that's cindy's cell in her
and we energy energy energy energy energy energy
what does that mean?
we're doing a bit of a shock, like some sort of...
trying to understand what i'm trying
you're trying to kill bugs, and i find it disgusting, even for a public supervisor, and even for an
let's keep moving we'
you both get out of my sight.
what happens to the cells after they have energy?
when the energy is energized to dna-free cells in the dnaless cells with the transmitter cells,
and then we put these into the sur transport mother, and eventually there's a baby dressed as a cloned
semen?
no, this is very impressive.
is it really possible?
i gotta admit, most of the embryo die.
but there's a chance one will make a success in it
we've already tried it in the sheep
human beings are also possible.
how far away is this technology?
