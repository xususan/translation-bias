right? </s>
that morning in <unk> <unk> would never have <unk> </s>
the <unk> air force <unk> an order to <unk> all <unk> <unk> right? </s>
that's what being a single <unk> is. </s>
no need to worry. </s>

what is this? </s>
the <unk> have been <unk> for over six hours, or the <unk> <unk> </s>

i ate <unk> <unk> too. </s>
tell me you're lying, harry. </s>
please. </s>
tell me you didn't betray <unk> </s>
it's been four hours, <unk> </s>

i'm thinking. </s>
the <unk> said you had something to say to me. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
you can't go anymore. </s>
i have something that you actually should have. </s>
the night your father died, we knew that. </s>
<unk> figured out a way to get everything to work, find a way to turn the <unk> into a <unk> <unk> </s>
you were wearing a wedding ring on the night of the <unk> </s>
i warned you not to be good enough. </s>
after the <unk> <unk> </s>

there's room for every <unk> in <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
this new trouble kills in the dark. </s>
these people will be grateful to you for your dark <unk> </s>
i think we should keep them safe here, but i'm worried things might get worse. </s>
they have no idea who caused the dark <unk> </s>
besides, it's not what you need to worry about in the dark. </s>
how did you get into that <unk> <unk> </s>
maybe it's a <unk> </s>
this is the last <unk> of <unk> <unk> </s>
i might need your help and a new job. </s>
it's under <unk> but for beauty <unk> it's more than just a <unk> <unk> </s>
try to figure things out. </s>
we talked about this. </s>
it's almost impossible to destroy the <unk> without killing him. </s>
sure, i just need the information i don't have, the <unk> that i don't have, and maybe i need information. </s>
i'm gonna need a team. </s>
any idea what's going on? </s>
but i have a bad memory. </s>
it's the only way i can get it back. </s>
and the <unk> problem is that the car is <unk> </s>
a <unk> to help fix the electrical <unk> </s>
he <unk> as soon as he found out. </s>
i <unk> her <unk> to make things better. </s>
what the hell are you doing? </s>
<unk> <unk> the killer is out there. </s>
and i think he really wants to prove to you that he wants to help you. </s>
okay, well, whatever the reason, just keep an eye on her for me, okay? </s>
because we both don't have the <unk> to new <unk> </s>
i'm not just saying it's my mom. </s>
while you're gone, i'm going to search for the person in the dark <unk> </s>
he <unk> <unk> and <unk> us. </s>
there was no other choice, <unk> </s>
this is the third party in two weeks. </s>
now the serial killer is in this building. </s>
all right, i'm gonna go talk to <unk> </s>
my dad always said you were a good man. </s>
<unk> father? </s>
there may be a way, but if you want it <unk> you'll have to do it a lot more <unk> so you
i can't even find <unk> <unk> </s>
you're telling me you can't find a town with <unk> <unk> </s>
there was no cause for this. </s>
then why don't we use the <unk> to finish the <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
so how do we <unk> </s>
a box full of <unk> <unk> left by <unk> <unk> </s>
i don't think i need a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> is just the first <unk> </s>

it's easy to <unk> but sometimes things are not what they think. </s>
we have a town to <unk> </s>

the same killer who killed them 27 years ago? </s>
we call him <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
what else are you hiding from me, <unk> </s>
<unk> is doing everything he can to accept the rules, but he's not gonna kill people. </s>
this is the same as <unk> <unk> </s>
thanks to our friend there, we left them in some kind of prison. </s>
<unk> says it's <unk> </s>
shit, the <unk> must have <unk> the <unk> <unk> </s>
that explains why the <unk> <unk> in town. </s>
this <unk> <unk> like, five minutes. </s>
it's almost over, and it's the only thing that can keep us in the dark. </s>

that's why i'm wearing this <unk> </s>
but we don't have the <unk> </s>
as we speak. </s>
when did you start <unk> young women? </s>

you don't understand. </s>
tell <unk> <unk> that <unk> wants to save <unk> <unk> </s>
so tell <unk> to stop. </s>

it's not about <unk> </s>
i don't want to talk about it. </s>
i want to know why you lied to me about <unk> </s>
you're <unk> </s>
you don't even want to be <unk> </s>

i can't resist the fact that <unk> is <unk> </s>
it's <unk> </s>
we'll get a new <unk> and a morning <unk> </s>
get up. </s>
<unk> </s>
no one. </s>

<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
this is not an issue here. </s>
from now on, we're going to work like my father did. </s>
i didn't mean to. </s>
good choice. </s>
a great <unk> wants a strong army behind him. </s>
we don't have to share a bed, but when we share a room, people will talk. </s>
i always liked it when we left here. </s>
he looks like he never left. </s>
if i tell my mother the truth, i'll lose her trust.
i also had a chance to get through one day. </s>
what about <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
you don't like <unk> </s>
i trust you. </s>
it's the right decision to make. </s>
i will be there for you in <unk> </s>
you'll be <unk> </s>
i just need to sleep. </s>
<unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
it's <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
i told you about <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
if we don't act now, we won't get a chance. </s>
<unk> </s>
help me with the <unk> </s>
help me with the net now. </s>
why won't you help me? </s>
<unk> </s>
come on, hurry up! </s>
go find me a <unk> </s>
people leave their precious things <unk> </s>
you owe my mother an apology. </s>
but i'm <unk> and it's <unk> </s>
so i'll take your life. </s>
go back to your <unk> little girl. </s>
<unk> </s>
i didn't need your help. </s>
because he didn't have enough money to save you. </s>

keep the <unk> <unk> </s>
hurry, you raw <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>

you should write songs about this <unk> </s>
a <unk> of your <unk> </s>
there's a <unk> about us. </s>

i don't want any problems for people, especially when it comes to <unk> </s>
in its own <unk> you can see a state of <unk> which is extremely <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> we make fun of those people, and the world <unk> with us. </s>
richard <unk> and i were hoping to come up with some <unk> idea. </s>
maybe we should be more <unk> with richard </s>
especially <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> </s>
i was sure it was like <unk> <unk> said. </s>
you're one of the bad guys. </s>
you don't want to write a book like that, <unk> </s>
but, of course, one of the <unk> and then what? </s>
what kind of <unk> </s>
how hard is it to do that to the people who think <unk> is good and good for <unk> </s>
<unk> is like moral <unk> for many people. </s>
if this is true, if religion does help people lead moral <unk> then one should take very seriously the <unk> that we're just going to have to <unk> it, that we're going to take the <unk> </s>
because there may be a lot of people left in the <unk> and this is a <unk> <unk> </s>
a lot of people expect <unk> to mean something, and where does that come from? </s>
yeah, but there's got to be something better than <unk> </s>
yeah, there's definitely hope. </s>
let's see what happens. </s>
of course. </s>
well, at least you didn't get <unk> </s>
i don't know how to explain this to <unk> </s>
i'm the <unk> man in the world. </s>

i can't imagine how <unk> it would be to marry you. </s>
if i had the chance to handle everything, i would have. </s>
i'm from <unk> <unk> </s>

i'm going to open you up right now, and i'm going to have to <unk>
if it's just a <unk> it's really a <unk> </s>
i don't think we should tell mom about this. </s>

whatever you say, johnny. </s>
you're the boss. </s>
she told you, didn't she? </s>
of course he did. </s>

i'm fine. </s>
i'm fine now, thank you. </s>
give us 25 <unk> <unk> and check it every two hours. </s>
yes, doctor. </s>
this is exactly the same as the other <unk> </s>
every simple <unk> is often <unk> </s>
this is <unk> </s>
do you have any idea what's going on in there? </s>
i know this is a <unk> experience for you, but what you have to understand is that what we're dealing with here is a <unk> situation. </s>
when he came here, he was <unk> </s>
why are you crying now? </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
come and go. </s>
such <unk> stress is <unk> </s>
i'm sure you have a nice <unk> and <unk> situation. </s>
what do we do in the <unk> </s>
nothing. </s>
what do you mean, <unk> </s>
we wait for <unk> to answer the questions. </s>
did you tell dad you had <unk> </s>
he has the right to know. </s>
you don't know exactly what you want from me, mr. <unk> </s>
dr. <unk> </s>
i don't trust <unk> </s>
you're a hospital <unk> and all i want to say is that he can hear us. </s>
dr. <unk> is a good young <unk> </s>
it seems that your father is perfectly <unk> and <unk> </s>
i told him that i would never say that he had cancer to my father because he's too afraid of these <unk> </s>
but whatever he did, he went right back to him. </s>
yeah, it's hard for every doctor to say. </s>
he is the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of your father's <unk> </s>
i'm sure he had no choice. </s>
there was a <unk> </s>
don't <unk> me. </s>
i know my father. </s>
why are you <unk> your <unk> </s>
to make you hurt yourself. </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
well, then, i'm his <unk> and i don't think he needs this. </s>
give us a call when you're ready, and we'll put him in his place. </s>
i can't believe this. </s>
hey, dad, how's it going? </s>
you always say that? </s>
look, hey, look, look, i brought <unk> </s>
and billy is here. </s>
hey, dad. </s>
how are you feeling, dad? </s>
can you hear me? </s>
hey, <unk> it's billy. </s>
how's it going? </s>
god, john, i can't bear to be here looking like this. </s>
i think that's enough. </s>
i gave him a <unk> </s>
that would destroy him. </s>
how long has he been like that? </s>
all the time we've been here. </s>
<unk> </s>
god, doctor. </s>
i'm glad you're not a detective. </s>
yeah, it looked <unk> </s>
what the hell is going on? </s>
i meant what you said, mr. <unk> </s>
mr. <unk> </s>
you can't keep telling me that he's <unk> doctor. </s>
it's not <unk> <unk> it's true, but the <unk> will bring it to itself. </s>
<unk> </s>
the guy is <unk> </s>
he's always <unk> </s>
he doesn't know anyone in his family and you just gave him a <unk> </s>
why don't you ask him about <unk> </s>
maybe you should try <unk> </s>
we decided to <unk> your father tomorrow. </s>
you can pick him up after <unk> </s>
what do you mean, <unk> </s>
you want to tell me about my father's <unk> </s>
well, of course not, but there's nothing we can do to tell him if he <unk> </s>
the <unk> are taking the <unk> off the road to <unk> empty <unk> </s>
how do i look? </s>
i can't help any of you! </s>
what exactly do you mean? </s>
whatever it is. </s>
which means it's not even <unk> </s>

what we need now is a good night's sleep. </s>
you always said there was a problem, <unk> </s>

i mean, there's <unk> right now, dad. </s>
let's sit on it. </s>
dad? </s>

i got you, i got you. </s>
i got you. </s>
mr. <unk> </s>
<unk> i understand you're not going back to the hospital. </s>
yeah. </s>
i thought it would be hard to make her feel at home. </s>
that's no place for him right now. </s>
you're not gonna be home too, are you? </s>
maybe you should try a <unk> <unk> </s>
i know how kids like to wear <unk> </s>
you know what that means. </s>
i know what <unk> is. </s>
mr. <unk> <unk> they are human <unk> </s>
we can handle any <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
we live in a <unk> where old people finally grow up. </s>
what's your name? </s>
why are you <unk> </s>
there's another doctor in this hospital. </s>
i think he can do better than dr. <unk> </s>
what? </s>
i <unk> everything they said. </s>
he's a good man. </s>
i want a <unk> of his <unk> </s>
mr. <unk> </s>
mr. <unk> </s>
<unk> mr. <unk> </s>
let's do some <unk> </s>
let's get a <unk> and identify the <unk> </s>
give us the <unk> and we'll <unk> your vital <unk> </s>
i'm not so sure what caused it, but right now i'm in the middle of a <unk> <unk> </s>
the question is, what caused it? </s>
and why is there no <unk> </s>
if you want to do another <unk> do your <unk> </s>
no, that won't be necessary. </s>
well, as we say, we sit around and do nothing, say nothing. </s>
<unk> </s>
we've done a series of tests so far, and we'll do more. </s>
so far our only hope is to shoot <unk> <unk> </s>
i appreciate your <unk> doctor. </s>
but it's been a long time since we had this <unk> right? </s>
if we stay here for a while, the <unk> will be <unk> him at all times. </s>
and i will visit him twice a day. </s>
he was <unk> from the start. </s>
i'm afraid that's not entirely <unk> </s>
how long are you going to take this? </s>
i don't know. </s>
i leave once a day. </s>
<unk> </s>
i'm talking to him. </s>
i'm here talking to <unk> </s>
i think if we stay there and he <unk> he's dead. </s>
what about <unk> </s>
<unk> it's <unk> </s>
you're the only one who can do it, john. </s>
why don't you take him to the <unk> </s>
i should've told you that. </s>
maybe i should be there when he comes to his end. </s>
i don't know. </s>
to prove he was still here. </s>
to prove i was his son. </s>
so what have you done <unk> </s>
<unk> this man has gone out to work every day in his life. </s>
i never trusted him. </s>
he did it because he was <unk> and he had no choice. </s>
you never asked me if i was happy or happy. </s>
you never asked if he had the right. </s>
and when that <unk> <unk> his <unk> he <unk> and <unk> him. </s>
but i <unk> it. </s>
john. </s>
i couldn't resist him, but my mother <unk> him. </s>
he's in the <unk> </s>
i did it because i had a marriage that went bad, and i had a job to <unk> and i barely have a son. </s>
maybe it'll be too hard for me. </s>
but i will be there when she dies. </s>
and i <unk> him and <unk> him. </s>
...and she <unk> the gold out there at the time. </s>
i owe him that. </s>
when did you come to town? </s>
never been. </s>
i'm staying with some friends. </s>
i didn't want to leave <unk> </s>
you come here every day? </s>
when you're gone, a nurse is looking for me. </s>
i'm standing over a half an hour. </s>
i'm <unk> <unk> </s>

how can i leave you alone? </s>
let's get these <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> </s>
and then i think you should do something. </s>
you gonna starve me out here? </s>
okay, first we need to get some <unk> </s>
remember, we haven't eaten in a long time. </s>
maybe that's why you're here. </s>
you can't do that, <unk> </s>
all the tests are <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
this is a healthy human being. </s>
i've seen people coming out of <unk> before. </s>
i don't usually know why. </s>
there's some <unk> on this. </s>

like what? </s>
the last time we <unk> we gave him <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and he was <unk> </s>

what are you looking for? </s>
your mother and i are starting a new life together, johnny. </s>
we need new <unk> </s>

this time i hope you stay away from <unk> </s>
let's go home. </s>
this is the second time <unk> has returned to us. </s>
it's our <unk> </s>
it means you work for <unk> which means he wasn't involved. </s>
good boy. </s>
by the way, get out. </s>
why don't you open your big mouth all the time, instead of <unk> your <unk> </s>
<unk> team is <unk> <unk> right? </s>
at least <unk> </s>
<unk> the <unk> you bought for <unk> </s>
i'm so proud of you. </s>
never hurts to be ready. </s>
if <unk> thinks he can help you, why not? </s>
i was joking. </s>
<unk> if you want to get to know <unk> better, maybe you have a <unk> dinner for him at our <unk> <unk> </s>
i mean, i... </s>
is it that <unk> </s>
i don't think anyone else noticed that. </s>
still, the last thing any of us should be doing is making a couple. </s>
office <unk> even under normal <unk> </s>
we live under normal circumstances. </s>
what are the chances that we don't have to deal with something we have to deal with out there? </s>
i don't know, maybe <unk> </s>
being a <unk> </s>
i actually wanted to be alone. </s>
<unk> tell him you like him. </s>
this murder happened a week ago. </s>
why are you telling me this now? </s>
how did you get these? </s>
the police told you that? </s>
they usually do when the victim was <unk> </s>
she said she was <unk> him. </s>
i was trying to get her to stop. </s>
it actually worked. </s>
look who's been <unk> 20 minutes before the crime <unk> </s>
what? </s>
okay, nice. </s>
and who's that? </s>
are you sure it's him? </s>
if you kill one of my <unk> i will <unk> his face. </s>
yes, that's him. </s>
now we know why the <unk> woman's death was given to me. </s>
he died because of me. </s>
if <unk> is somehow <unk> then so am i. </s>
<unk> </s>
hey. </s>
whatever you're doing right now, you're not responsible for this, and neither am i. </s>
but i know who you are. </s>
a little <unk> <unk> </s>
long day at the office. </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
i got this. </s>
i know some of her powers have <unk> it. </s>
billy was definitely mad at me, and you believed him. </s>
this is the most important <unk> in the country. </s>
east <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> won't do anything to them. </s>
it's not like some <unk> <unk> </s>
stay away from <unk> </s>
i don't think <unk> will be very good either. </s>
how about we sneak in and pretend like we're not <unk> </s>
all right, you wanna go next? </s>
i think we should stay here. </s>
why didn't you call me when you asked me in? </s>
as far as i know, we have <unk> <unk> </s>
i've never loved a woman in my life. </s>
i just love <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
really? </s>
you <unk> me. </s>
we're taking you in for <unk> </s>
<unk> read him his rights. </s>
who are you? </s>
no one. </s>
there is a woman in the world who doesn't give a shit about <unk> </s>
yeah, it's a prison <unk> with <unk> million in it. </s>
yes, but for how long? </s>
a <unk> <unk> <unk> in a demon <unk> couldn't do much, so my guess, regular <unk> not really a problem. </s>
<unk> what are you gonna do? </s>
you can't just walk into a police station, <unk> </s>
there's been an accident. </s>
we need to tell him what the woman in the <unk> did to her before she was
it's not a bad idea to come by while you're visiting the patient in the hospital. </s>
it's part of the blood you <unk> </s>
not human. </s>
he's headed this way. </s>
i'll take a sample and see what kind of <unk> billy is. </s>
i'll take care of a <unk> </s>
<unk> daily <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
i don't think you should do this. </s>
how do i look? </s>
i managed to get blood from the <unk> </s>
maybe we can find out what demon <unk> and how the <unk> work. </s>
can you get me a glass <unk> </s>
thank you. </s>
are you going to invite me in? </s>
please, come in. </s>
i want you to call me <unk> </s>
<unk> tell <unk> everything. </s>
what makes you think i would do that? </s>
first of all, it was your fault. </s>
if you try to <unk> i know now. </s>
<unk> side by side. </s>
<unk> feels responsible for this boy because he brought her back from <unk> </s>
i feel responsible because he did it to save me. </s>
in fact, you're completely responsible for that because you're a <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> this spring isn't <unk> </s>
billy <unk> <unk> people. </s>
then why are you wearing <unk> </s>
others can take hours. </s>
god, <unk> i hope you start to feel <unk> </s>
you're really <unk> </s>
i have to find <unk> </s>
and why should i help you? </s>
do you remember the man you used to break into <unk> </s>
you know what he did to me? </s>
the shape of the <unk> <unk> <unk> is that every second of every second his <unk> ends in pain, or until he dies. </s>
it's about <unk> </s>
you certainly have something you can do to stop it. </s>
your life could be destroyed by someone else. </s>
and if a woman strong enough to make her <unk> she would never forgive her <unk> </s>
where's <unk> </s>
i understand why you did this to your <unk> <unk> </s>
there's a reason, right? </s>
how many times you want to talk to <unk> <unk> </s>
shall i introduce you? </s>
she probably left it in the back, told her how to drive. </s>
you know these <unk> </s>
probably deserved it. </s>
like i said... </s>
<unk> <unk> here. </s>
hi, <unk> </s>
billy. </s>
i didn't know you were having a party. </s>
i thought we agreed that you weren't here anymore. </s>
do you want to, or should i? </s>
some of the <unk> seem to be <unk> strong. </s>
these are probably from <unk> demon <unk> </s>
so it looks like <unk> <unk> people with <unk> <unk> </s>
which means it could be <unk> or <unk> or even <unk> </s>
<unk> where's <unk> <unk> </s>
when he got out of the <unk> he thought he was coming out because he was sleeping with her.
well... when i <unk> </s>
if you lie to me again, it'll be a serious problem. </s>
sit down, <unk> </s>
there's something we need to talk about. </s>
i'm sorry i didn't know you went to <unk> </s>
we still have to make some changes around here. </s>
change can be good, i guess. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
maybe your mom and dad never told you what he was going after grown men in <unk> </s>
you can't just come in here all the time and talk like that.
you can't blame me for actually taking her. </s>
is that what you want? </s>
stop it. </s>
now you're <unk> </s>
put your hair in the back, close your eyes, and then join us in the <unk> </s>
you think you can do anything you want because you stick to a life of <unk> </s>
no. </s>
i'll show you the blood. </s>
what do you say to a woman with two eyes on <unk> </s>
nothing you've already said twice. </s>
no sense of humor. </s>
honestly, i'm calling to kill that <unk> </s>
come in. </s>
you should know the rules about billy. </s>
<unk> everybody knows the rules. </s>
you leave your girlfriend alone with her with your <unk> and you never let her touch you. </s>
you want money, leave it on the table, <unk> </s>
can you teach me something? </s>
why did you invite me in after i told you i wanted to kill <unk> </s>
you're <unk> right? </s>
did billy mention me? </s>
he said someone named <unk> was coming here sooner or later. </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
i know what you did. </s>
who you are. </s>
you <unk> me. </s>
he <unk> me to find you. </s>
it's like a <unk> game. </s>
don't make me <unk> to girls. </s>
but you'll never die, will you? </s>
no, you stay and you keep running. </s>
guess what, <unk> i'm not a <unk> <unk> </s>
i'm a <unk> </s>
you showed up, didn't you? </s>
no, <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
you and <unk> <unk> conspiracy <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> eat this. </s>
it's just a <unk> </s>
the problem is <unk> </s>
why are you telling me this? </s>
do i know you? </s>
i thought you should leave. </s>
the burning <unk> used to <unk> you and torture you into the <unk> </s>
i see. </s>
the woman who <unk> the <unk> <unk> she needs to shoot the whole <unk> <unk> </s>
no, asshole. </s>
i'm here to arrest you. </s>
i mean, sure, you women sell yourselves for money and <unk> but men are just as bad as they are. </s>
maybe even worse. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> even <unk> for what's under your <unk> </s>
i don't wear pants. </s>
actually, i was here because i had an arrow in my <unk> <unk> </s>
and a <unk> <unk> </s>
i don't think so. </s>
you don't have the guts to do this. </s>
<unk> again. </s>
don't hurt me! </s>
no, i won't hurt her. </s>
i'm not gonna hurt her. </s>
here. </s>
i can tell you that <unk> blood is <unk> </s>
so the fingerprints downstairs are on <unk> <unk> </s>
and you think i'm just gonna take it in my hand and turn it into a <unk> <unk> </s>
it <unk> me even though i look like this. </s>
i'd better get out of here. </s>
lock the door behind me. </s>
maybe the plan is <unk> </s>
oh, god. </s>
you said the plan was <unk> but what's the plan <unk> </s>
plan <unk> </s>
plan <unk> </s>
the plan is to kill you if you don't stop <unk> </s>
oh, god. </s>
<unk> get out of here. </s>
to get to the <unk> all the <unk> all the <unk> </s>
please go. </s>
i can't. </s>
this is my <unk> </s>
you think that's your problem? </s>
you know what your real problem is? </s>

you can't do this. </s>
do you want to hear my <unk> <unk> </s>
about how stupid you are. </s>
after five years of <unk> i believe that to be safe, we went out to the dark little <unk> to be safe. </s>
let's finish this. </s>
i'm sorry, <unk> </s>
you're sorry? </s>
you were right about how i liked dark places for <unk> </s>
but you forgot that i also love <unk> <unk> </s>
i don't understand. </s>
i mean, you're a <unk> but why don't you get out of the <unk> </s>
maybe it's because i'm not human. </s>
and a vampire can never be <unk> </s>
you know that thing about <unk> <unk> </s>
it was always about pain and <unk> </s>
i think evil <unk> makes you less of a <unk> than people. </s>
like a noble one. </s>
i mean, being a <unk> is really <unk> </s>
strange. </s>
what is it? </s>
i was out <unk> <unk> and i was also a <unk> </s>
i understand that. </s>
<unk> it's me, <unk> </s>

i left you a lot of messages. </s>

you don't belong here. </s>
why? </s>
i can't help you, fool. </s>

you can't have someone who really loves you. </s>
i don't want to love anyone, understand? </s>
to find the right person. </s>
i'm not the right person for anyone, <unk> </s>
come on. </s>
<unk> i'm <unk> okay? </s>
i like men, don't you understand? </s>
go away! </s>

why? </s>
i can't hear you. </s>
when you came home late, you looked like a <unk> <unk> and you kissed me again. </s>

all kinds of <unk> are <unk> </s>
come on, pick it up. </s>
a <unk> </s>
come on. </s>
and me. </s>
good, isn't it? </s>
even when i was a kid, i felt different. </s>
<unk> football <unk> or something like that. </s>
because if you're fat and <unk> no one can explain why you're dressed like the others. </s>
no one can <unk> that i'm gay. </s>
but i did not give in to this <unk> until my private <unk> </s>
i'm not allowed to <unk> <unk> </s>
and they gave me a <unk> </s>
there was this incredibly handsome <unk> who <unk> me to keep him safe from being <unk> without any <unk> </s>
i don't know if <unk> would have made me <unk> so he could take <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> or get a <unk> </s>
first <unk> one <unk> </s>
i'm tired of being gay. </s>
really. </s>

you have to pay me anyway. </s>
i'm a <unk> </s>
the worst <unk> of all time. </s>
<unk> a bad, <unk> <unk> </s>
i'm a <unk> </s>
it doesn't have to be bad. </s>
always with something ready to be <unk> </s>
that's why it's better to see us if we get rid of them and find out where they're taking us. </s>
because most of them are the <unk> of the answers we're looking for. </s>
put your hands on the <unk> </s>
close your eyes. </s>
let's all breathe together. </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
breathe, breathe. </s>
i thought the problem was <unk> but it's <unk> </s>
we all have <unk> </s>
<unk> is the first step we need to <unk> or <unk> anything we want. </s>
i don't know about you, but i don't believe in <unk>
i did it on purpose. </s>
i'm <unk> </s>
<unk> but <unk> </s>

i warned you, but you didn't. </s>
i warned you, but you didn't. </s>
excuse me, but what's your love? </s>
are you <unk> because you want to, or because you want to keep pretending everything's <unk> </s>
society wants you to be fat. </s>
if they do, everyone will feel better, because they are <unk> </s>
not anymore. </s>
it's time to take the first step. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
one move, <unk> </s>
but one day of <unk> isn't enough. </s>
