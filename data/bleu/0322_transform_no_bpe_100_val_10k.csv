i don't think it's appropriate for us to work together. 
yeah, i miss my mom.

we need to do a <unk> trial on the <unk> of war and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> 
i'm not sure i understand the <unk> of <unk> <unk>

he must have <unk> my <unk> 
i spent <unk> years in <unk> <unk> a son of <unk> 
you can't get me out of this. 
you may not be social <unk> but you should take <unk> back. 
but we can't trust him either. 
i don't have your mother's <unk> and <unk> anymore. 
hello. 
michael. 
there are two girls here. 
a couple of fun <unk> 
come on, michael. 
a little <unk> <unk> 
i told you to stay here, <unk> 
<unk> 
by the way, when do you meet someone? 
by the way, <unk> george <unk> <unk> 
why am i telling you this? 
i guess it's because you have something to say to your father. 
<unk> george <unk> thought he wanted us to find out that he wanted <unk> <unk> to carry out his mission. 
there's nothing wrong with that. 
but i still have to give you a little bit of faith in what you do for me. 
and <unk> was taking over this mission. 
and <unk> <unk> this mission. 
one day, you'll find the right woman to put this mission in place. 
but until then, i'll be right across from you. 
i have never been more proud of <unk> in my whole life. 
this <unk> was waiting for <unk> to show up. 
this is the girl <unk> sent to you. 
girl, <unk> young girl. 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> 
and here's your <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
i mean, there's milk on the <unk> 
yeah. 
but the <unk> of <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
because, you know, <unk> and <unk> 
i find you very <unk> 
<unk> <unk> michael, <unk> really? 
and george <unk> was about to visit a surprise party. 
i got all the <unk> and all the <unk> 
and i watched them all again. 
george <unk> is using a series of <unk> <unk> <unk> to make money for his people in order to win new <unk> 
i also lost two pounds on your <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i've come to learn at your place. 
this is a good place to start. 
and michael, after two girls from <unk> <unk> met <unk> <unk> <unk> 
hi, <unk> this is my <unk> <unk> or this <unk> room is not the same as our <unk> 
i think he's very good for you. 
i used to think that would <unk> the <unk> of <unk> 
besides, just because my son wants you to do something like this doesn't mean you can't just move in with someone
i'm miss <unk> <unk> 
there is no <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
and michael began his son's moral <unk> 
and that's the <unk> of the situation. 
you know, it's <unk> 
i mean, mr. <unk> was <unk> and then they gave me this class. 
i thought you were joking. 
no, only because you were there. 
<unk> - <unk> 
but, you know, uh... 
and i think it's a moral <unk> 
yeah. 
here's a moral question. 
can a parent invite some <unk> 
<unk> 
yeah, he's dead. 
<unk> that mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> 
let's go get a drink. 
well, maybe it'll help. 
george <unk> has <unk> his own <unk> 
i've already told you so many <unk> 
maybe you could teach me some <unk> 
well, there are signs of <unk> <unk> 
but, back to your <unk> 
tell me one of those college <unk> you know about this thing. 
and michael was meeting with miss <unk> the second <unk> today.

he's out of control. 
who is it?

that's a good idea. 
but how do we get the <unk> in here? 
this may not be my best idea. 
i'm sorry, michael.

you took someone i love. 
and i got one of your favorite <unk> 
i'm <unk> <unk>

<unk> 
i mean, you took him to his <unk> 
hi, george michael.

<unk> <unk> all <unk> 
what did you say to her? 
i'll set you free after the <unk> 
they want to give you a deal. 
put everything on the <unk> and go. 
i told them i could do this after i did. 
there's no way out. 
<unk> 
there's a backup key in the <unk> <unk> 
whatever it takes. 
<unk> what are you <unk> 
what did you give him? 
check the <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
i found <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> 
where you trap someone. 
<unk> 
i gave it to him.

get down! 
<unk> us. 
get down! 
get down! 
i'm not here for you! 
we came for them.

think about <unk> 
<unk> 
why? 
there's 50 men on the other side of this <unk> 
you must surrender. 
come here. 
open up! 
if you think we're <unk> 
open the door. 
but he'll kill us. 
too many demon in a room. 
the only way to get out of here alive is to turn yourself in.
you think i want to get out? 
how many lives have you lost in this room, <unk> 
my name is <unk> 
your <unk> 
for them, <unk> was not the one who wanted the <unk> for them. 
if you were a <unk> 
i think the <unk> <unk> is clearly <unk> 
i'm <unk> <unk> 
kill me and i'll kill you! 
otherwise, you're nothing but a dead <unk> 
no one can see you as a hero. 
when we're done, you'll be a <unk> who <unk> his wife with <unk> 
we give a few <unk> of male <unk> a free <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i know you so well, don't you, <unk> 
wait, wait, wait. 
i <unk> your <unk> 
but... 
you fucking bitch! 
i thought you had a higher <unk> 
i'm sorry about your wife's death, <unk> 
i know what that can do to you. 
is that supposed to stop me? 
it's okay. 
stop! 
why did you bring her here? 
i made a choice. 
without a plan b. 
why do you think i keep you out of that room? 
people are still <unk> harry. 
less than those who are going to die. 
how could you choose such a <unk> 
that's my job. 
<unk> <unk> can you come out to play? 
hello, <unk> 
in the end, it comes down to who <unk> the longest <unk> 
right? 
that morning in <unk> <unk> would never have <unk> 
the <unk> air force <unk> an order to <unk> all <unk> <unk> right? 
that's what being a single <unk> is. 
no need to worry. 
<unk> your own <unk> so you can be <unk> by a foreign power. 
the americans would have made you director general <unk> no doubt. 
how many more lives have you saved in that <unk> 
<unk> what you think is <unk> <unk> 
the service is dying. 
but the second i realized i was on the losing side, my <unk> would be too short. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i think this came from you. 
what is this? 
the <unk> have been <unk> for over six hours, or the <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
how <unk> 
i was afraid that would be your <unk> 
so i took the chance to make a choice. 
<unk> it's not lunch. 
i ate <unk> <unk> too. 
tell me you're lying, harry. 
please. 
tell me you didn't betray <unk> 
it's been four hours, <unk> 
i spent the last two hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd go to that beautiful <unk> 
i'm thinking. 
the <unk> said you had something to say to me. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
you can't go anymore. 
i have something that you actually should have. 
the night your father died, we knew that. 
<unk> figured out a way to get everything to work, find a way to turn the <unk> into a <unk> <unk> 
you were wearing a wedding ring on the night of the <unk> 
i warned you not to be good enough. 
after the <unk> <unk> 
you <unk> 
<unk> will live forever, will. 
then who <unk> 
they're like me. 
<unk> <unk> and <unk> have been very helpful. 
there's room for every <unk> in <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
this new trouble kills in the dark. 
these people will be grateful to you for your dark <unk> 
i think we should keep them safe here, but i'm worried things might get worse. 
they have no idea who caused the dark <unk> 
besides, it's not what you need to worry about in the dark. 
how did you get into that <unk> <unk> 
maybe it's a <unk> 
this is the last <unk> of <unk> <unk> 
i might need your help and a new job. 
it's under <unk> but for beauty <unk> it's more than just a <unk> <unk> 
try to figure things out. 
we talked about this. 
it's almost impossible to destroy the <unk> without killing him. 
sure, i just need the information i don't have, the <unk> that i don't have, and maybe i need information. 
i'm gonna need a team. 
any idea what's going on? 
but i have a bad memory. 
it's the only way i can get it back. 
and the <unk> problem is that the car is <unk> 
a <unk> to help fix the electrical <unk> 
he <unk> as soon as he found out. 
i <unk> her <unk> to make things better. 
what the hell are you doing? 
<unk> <unk> the killer is out there. 
and i think he really wants to prove to you that he wants to help you. 
okay, well, whatever the reason, just keep an eye on her for me, okay? 
because we both don't have the <unk> to new <unk> 
i'm not just saying it's my mom. 
while you're gone, i'm going to search for the person in the dark <unk> 
he <unk> <unk> and <unk> us. 
there was no other choice, <unk> 
this is the third party in two weeks. 
now the serial killer is in this building. 
all right, i'm gonna go talk to <unk> 
my dad always said you were a good man. 
<unk> father? 
there may be a way, but if you want it <unk> you'll have to do it a lot more <unk> so you
i can't even find <unk> <unk> 
you're telling me you can't find a town with <unk> <unk> 
there was no cause for this. 
then why don't we use the <unk> to finish the <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
so how do we <unk> 
a box full of <unk> <unk> left by <unk> <unk> 
i don't think i need a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> is just the first <unk> 
<unk> thought you'd find him. 
it's easy to <unk> but sometimes things are not what they think. 
we have a town to <unk> 
<unk> percent of the <unk> are <unk> 
guys, i'm <unk> but i've never done anything like this before. 
i can park the car here to meet you, but i don't have enough money to pay for the oil <unk> 
if all goes well, i'll be back with my <unk> by <unk> 
this is <unk> husband <unk> 
there's enough panic and fear. 
the same killer who killed them 27 years ago? 
we call him <unk> <unk> <unk> 
what else are you hiding from me, <unk> 
<unk> is doing everything he can to accept the rules, but he's not gonna kill people. 
this is the same as <unk> <unk> 
thanks to our friend there, we left them in some kind of prison. 
<unk> says it's <unk> 
shit, the <unk> must have <unk> the <unk> <unk> 
that explains why the <unk> <unk> in town. 
this <unk> <unk> like, five minutes. 
it's almost over, and it's the only thing that can keep us in the dark. 
here, we can go back to town faster than we can get into town, but there's nothing more we can do. 
you better run. 
help each other. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> i'm happy here. 
i got your message. 
get in the car now. 
come on, <unk> 
the war we stand in front of us is not worth it. 
i don't think there's anything worse than being in love. 
<unk> <unk> 
there's two sides to every story. 
behind this is a <unk> 
let's go. 
<unk> <unk> asked me to represent him. 
<unk> you are my brother's <unk> 
that's why he's my brother. 
<unk> <unk> bigger <unk> than here. 
none of them were killed by a woman. 
i can get you a second <unk> and i can get you a <unk> during <unk> 
then we will listen to friend and <unk> 
there's no <unk> 
my mother and others will escort you. 
<unk> this is <unk> <unk> 
does <unk> always have to be <unk> 
i don't really understand this. 
but i know i shouldn't be <unk> 
i got him! 
this marriage is <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
what do you do? 
<unk> 
i'll keep you on the wall, then. 
who are you? 
the <unk> is a <unk> 
like i said, i have work to do. 
i need to know how to handle it. 
<unk> said i couldn't accept a gift. 
then we'll keep it. 
when the wedding time comes, every bride is beautiful. 
remember, this is our <unk> 
sit. 
we'll take what we need from <unk> 
you wanted to talk? 
all right. 
<unk> it's time. 
are you gonna be the second person to <unk> <unk> 
for the game. 
we need to talk sometime. 
we need to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> 
i think the <unk> <unk> might be <unk> 
<unk> 
come on, <unk> 
old <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
i'm so sorry. 
just a little <unk> 
that's all. 
we're gonna help <unk> <unk> with the <unk> 
sounds easy. 
<unk> 
open the door! 
<unk> you rotten <unk> 
come on! 
<unk> 
put your arm around me. 
come on! 
<unk> 
quiet, <unk> asleep. 
is this <unk> <unk> 
i don't know why <unk> would want to marry <unk> 
i don't think so. 
put aside your <unk> and do your best for everyone. 
<unk> would you put aside for others? 
that's all we have to do. 
if someone <unk> their entire life to other <unk> then it's <unk> 
it must be very <unk> to think like that. 
try. 
whoever you are, tell the truth. 
only then do you look at each other and you light a fire on <unk> 
then you will be husband and wife. 
couldn't you have killed someone before? 
no. 
before i came here, you... 
you wanna be a <unk> 
tell <unk> i'm done with him. 
<unk> 
come on! 
go! 
you killed him. 
we're not done here. 
don't you understand? 
you betrayed my mother and <unk> my <unk> 
this woman was sent here to kill you! 
i don't know. 
if you say so. 
i didn't kill my brother. 
he's the one you should have been with today. 
even if the world was <unk> <unk> had everything. 
people love him because he's <unk> 
<unk> called him the first child. 
<unk> <unk> 
and then you took the chance to get out of there. 
i don't need anything. 
it's <unk> but it's him. 
<unk> 
after i killed him. 
<unk> won't tell anyone what you did here and what happened here today. 
or stay. 
<unk> but <unk> 
he went to bed last night. 
but you don't know who <unk> was talking to. 
<unk> light is with me. 
you wanna be a <unk> 
i can help you. 
<unk> versus <unk> 
i've had enough of you, <unk> 
you're the one who <unk> with this <unk> 
<unk> has been <unk> these rules by every <unk> 
the life of a killer whose blood money is <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
all the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> will be <unk> by the <unk> 
what right does a fish <unk> have? 
you know, you risk your life to catch <unk> every summer. 
this <unk> reminds me. 
<unk> will give you the most needed <unk> 
i got your attention. 
i'm <unk> enough. 
you're late for your <unk> 
some think they're going to kill him again. 
but if you <unk> the <unk> will be in the <unk> and the <unk> will <unk> 
<unk> you know i'm talking about murder. 
kill it! 
kill me now! 
i'm <unk> 
if you do it without any <unk> we all will. 
<unk> hired us to deliver the <unk> after the <unk> 
are we talking about the guy who helped him escape the first time? 
that's why i'm wearing this <unk> 
but we don't have the <unk> 
as we speak. 
when did you start <unk> young women? 
what do you mean? 
i haven't had a <unk> in a long time. 
remember who you're talking to. 
speak. 
the boy wants your brother's <unk> life or blood money. 
i didn't mean to kill anyone. 
hurry! 
thank you. 
<unk> fell in love with her. 
he's looking for the money he thinks he has money, and then he's gonna find it, asshole. 
he left my mother and took everything that was <unk> 
my brother went after him. 
but it cost him his life. 
<unk> is it true? 
i'll pay for your brother's blood money. 
<unk> do you have 50 silver <unk> 
i don't want money, i want <unk> 
silence! 
if the blood money <unk> the <unk> goes free. 
you lied to me. 
<unk> 
<unk> 
<unk> it now. 
stand by, they're coming. 
i saw it. 
get out! 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> wants to take my position as a <unk> for the <unk> 
i was <unk> with <unk> <unk> when you let me down. 
you don't understand. 
tell <unk> <unk> that <unk> wants to save <unk> <unk> 
so tell <unk> to stop. 
say it. 
i'm sorry. 
i knew you killed one of my <unk> but you didn't tell me a story about <unk>
it's just his <unk> 
<unk> nobody's gonna think any less of you. 
that's all i've got. 
did you bring it? 
there's no 50 silver here. 
not enough. 
and i'm going to keep that job <unk> 
was there enough money? 
<unk> 
turn it off, please. 
<unk> <unk> 
leave <unk> of <unk> <unk> and never come back. 
there's no place for you here. 
<unk> i want to fight <unk> 
if <unk> <unk> i'll kill you. 
let's try. 
it's not about <unk> 
i don't want to talk about it. 
i want to know why you lied to me about <unk> 
you're <unk> 
you don't even want to be <unk> 
yeah? 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
move. 
now! 
are you dating girls now? 
the view was more like <unk> <unk> 
i know i let you down. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
but there are <unk> 
you seem like you could use your own <unk> 
this <unk> needs a <unk> in the <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
a <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> are <unk> to betray the <unk> of <unk> <unk> 
what's the point of having <unk> all of us? 
we are here to give <unk> the <unk> of <unk> 
i can't resist the fact that <unk> is <unk> 
it's <unk> 
we'll get a new <unk> and a morning <unk> 
get up. 
<unk> 
no one. 
don't play games. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
this is not an issue here. 
from now on, we're going to work like my father did. 
i didn't mean to. 
good choice. 
a great <unk> wants a strong army behind him. 
we don't have to share a bed, but when we share a room, people will talk. 
i always liked it when we left here. 
he looks like he never left. 
if i tell my mother the truth, i'll lose her trust.
i also had a chance to get through one day. 
what about <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
you don't like <unk> 
i trust you. 
it's the right decision to make. 
i will be there for you in <unk> 
you'll be <unk> 
i just need to sleep. 
<unk> 
<unk> 
it's <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
i told you about <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
if we don't act now, we won't get a chance. 
<unk> 
help me with the <unk> 
help me with the net now. 
why won't you help me? 
<unk> 
come on, hurry up! 
go find me a <unk> 
people leave their precious things <unk> 
you owe my mother an apology. 
but i'm <unk> and it's <unk> 
so i'll take your life. 
go back to your <unk> little girl. 
<unk> 
i didn't need your help. 
because he didn't have enough money to save you. 
you can take her to <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
no, <unk> 
get ready. 
<unk> no! 
keep the <unk> <unk> 
hurry, you raw <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
hold on! 
and now <unk> 
a <unk> 
you should write songs about this <unk> 
a <unk> of your <unk> 
there's a <unk> about us. 
<unk> is our biggest <unk> 
even the sword was <unk> by a <unk> <unk> 
who's <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
we need to get rid of <unk> 
<unk> 
<unk> 
<unk> coming together. 
this time, <unk> destroy us. 
<unk> 
if we go back to the <unk> today, we will <unk> more <unk> and <unk> religious <unk> 
<unk> <unk> is more likely to be concerned about soviet <unk> or <unk> <unk> 
i don't want any problems for people, especially when it comes to <unk> 
in its own <unk> you can see a state of <unk> which is extremely <unk> 
<unk> <unk> we make fun of those people, and the world <unk> with us. 
richard <unk> and i were hoping to come up with some <unk> idea. 
maybe we should be more <unk> with richard 
especially <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> 
i was sure it was like <unk> <unk> said. 
you're one of the bad guys. 
you don't want to write a book like that, <unk> 
but, of course, one of the <unk> and then what? 
what kind of <unk> 
how hard is it to do that to the people who think <unk> is good and good for <unk> 
<unk> is like moral <unk> for many people. 
if this is true, if religion does help people lead moral <unk> then one should take very seriously the <unk> that we're just going to have to <unk> it, that we're going to take the <unk> 
because there may be a lot of people left in the <unk> and this is a <unk> <unk> 
a lot of people expect <unk> to mean something, and where does that come from? 
yeah, but there's got to be something better than <unk> 
yeah, there's definitely hope. 
let's see what happens. 
of course. 
well, at least you didn't get <unk> 
i don't know how to explain this to <unk> 
i'm the <unk> man in the world. 
all right, cut it out. 
i'm the <unk> man in the world. 
all right, you win. 
i can't find <unk> <unk> 
honey, just so you know, you can't even turn a baby into a <unk> 
i need to find the paper that <unk> <unk> gave me in <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i finally got myself and my <unk> responsible for my health problems. 
i haven't talked to her since the night we were <unk> 
calm down. 
you gave me all the important details about the <unk> 
do you have all the <unk> 
her father's little girl has become the great daughter of her father. 
it could be <unk> 
very <unk> 
<unk> 
it's your birthday. 
my birthday is tomorrow. 
we used to party all the time when we were
after what i lost my birthday? 
<unk> years <unk> 
you know, i had <unk> <unk> for me. 
how much do you think i <unk> 
but i... 
if we don't get them back in time, <unk> <unk> and i may or may not be the only owner of the <unk> <unk> 
we're all just waiting for the new baby to come and we're all <unk> 
if you ask me, <unk> won't be a problem once you've seen this <unk> 
because you're <unk> best friend and you're the only one who sees the girl. 
i like it, i got it. 
all right, emma finally <unk> 
hey, danny, what made you celebrate your birthday? 
seriously, why does she hate it so much? 
i, <unk> <unk> will spend the next 16 years of age <unk> 
are you sure you want to watch this? 
i suppose if it was a disaster. 
all right, come on, guys. 
danny, where are we going? 
<unk> the future is your <unk> <unk> <unk> 
is ben here? 
benjamin <unk> come in here and celebrate <unk> birthday. 
well, i can tell you that this is the best birthday present ever. 
tell me you didn't do anything. 
in fact, first try to save <unk> then just stop. 
is <unk> still in love with <unk> or is that what happened as a kid? 
of course you're still in love with <unk> 
i ruined her <unk> <unk> birthday. 
it's not a birthday party, but it's definitely the rest of the days. 
i may not have lost faith in <unk> and if you didn't care to marry me so much, maybe you don't deserve to take it on your own. 
if you feel better, we do most of the work. 
i can imagine how hard it must have been to <unk> 
no matter how great or funny you thought it would be, i finally knew it was gonna be <unk> 
<unk> city <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
and as a <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the weapon is also highly <unk> 
<unk> has more power than a <unk> <unk> 
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> 
miss <unk> is also a <unk> for <unk> <unk> 
in the name of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of today's <unk> was <unk> 
<unk> going to <unk> tonight. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
oh, and... 
mrs <unk> you have put me in a very small position today. 
i'm not here for <unk> 
i'll tell you one thing, <unk> 
wow! 
<unk> 
what is it? 
<unk> leave this to me! 
<unk> <unk> 
i'm telling you, don't worry. 
can't i buy you dinner in <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
according to the <unk> this incident was very <unk> 
<unk> terrorist business. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
what are you <unk> <unk> 
i hope you understand the <unk> of the incident was entirely yours. 
in any case, the situation is quite clear. 
i used it for field <unk> 
it's <unk> 
i have the right to do, <unk> 
<unk> <unk> is currently <unk> at <unk> 
once we know the crime scene, the <unk> are giving us trouble. 
i wonder if <unk> <unk> will be <unk> 
we <unk> ourselves from the <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i am the only one who can stand up to <unk> and <unk> 
although lieutenant <unk> was one of the <unk> <unk> he was the best <unk> in <unk> 
<unk> 
there's no one at the <unk> 
anyway, <unk> is a little <unk> 
<unk> you really are a nice <unk> 
when he went to study in england he <unk> all <unk> 
how did you know that? 
<unk> called me and asked me to give you a message. 
use the <unk> <unk> to open the <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
pilot <unk> <unk> 
it feels like we're <unk> for <unk>

if you want to make things better, you're gonna get over it. 
lieutenant <unk> was able to <unk> the most advanced <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> 
in that case, the big panic center was <unk> 
there must be somebody in this <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
what can we do? 
we don't know the <unk> of <unk> yet. 
if we can find him before the lieutenant <unk> then maybe we'll have a chance. 
but <unk> <unk> 
the power <unk> from the <unk> <unk> is <unk> 
how much is the <unk> 
hey, you heard me! 
wait for me. 
that's it! 
<unk> <unk> 
what are you doing on the way? 
he <unk> down the road like a <unk> 
<unk> <unk> man!

that <unk> woman was wearing a knife. 
<unk> only care about him. 
i had it right from the start. 
i know <unk> 
he wasn't the type to kill himself. 
he's not a coward. 
you can't do that to your own child, and not us. 
and a proper <unk> 
when someone comes after <unk> we'll know what to do. 
there's only one <unk> 
he's <unk> <unk> 
i never thought i'd see it like that, <unk> 
thank god you said the <unk> thing. 
all he had to do was <unk> him. 
i think you're definitely good on it, <unk> 
good evening, girls. 
what are you doing here? 
i came here from <unk> <unk> 
the last time we met, you had some information. 
we don't want to hear anything from you.

oh, <unk> you <unk> 
i had a terrible behavior the other day. 
but recent <unk> have caused <unk> <unk> 
i lost my mother. 
it's very sudden and... <unk> 
very <unk> <unk> 
it's a terrible <unk> for everyone who <unk> their mother. 
it was. 
yeah. 
and it made me think that i should let <unk> go. 
but i think you should know i'm seeing a man. 
actually, i got the <unk> 
i can't imagine how <unk> it would be to marry you. 
if i had the chance to handle everything, i would have. 
i'm from <unk> <unk> 
i know i missed my chance. 
i'm not half the man you <unk> 
but i asked myself. 
<unk> what do you have to do to support the girls you love so much? 
and then i remembered to call you, and i thought i was this guy so i knew about your new friend. 
the result is breaking my heart because your <unk> is a <unk> <unk> 
we don't need to see this. 
what's the matter with you? 
you are a pain in the ass, and i am too old to believe you. 
<unk> then. 
i did my best. 
my mother always said that when a woman <unk> you don't <unk> 
who is it? 
kid.

<unk> 
what's that? 
<unk> 
i'd hate to see you say <unk> 
who are you? 
my name is <unk> <unk> 
i've come to give you new hands. 
okay? 
<unk> <unk> is an old friend of mine. 
<unk> <unk> 
no, thanks. 
i saw the soldiers with the <unk> 
get your cool <unk> <unk> 
i may not be <unk> but at least i know i can take care of myself. 
and i don't have to spend the rest of my life on the wooden <unk> 
i could teach you something more <unk> than <unk> <unk> 
i haven't <unk> 
look. 
see? 
the other one, too. 
<unk> saved my life. 
your mother would have <unk> you and left you on the street. 
if you hadn't met him, i wouldn't be so stupid. 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
very much.

then he fell off the <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
i had to get out while i still could. 
plan <unk> 
how can i look into <unk> eyes when i know that those <unk> are free? 
i had to stop.

he saved me from a <unk> and he tortured me again, and again. 
how do i look? 
i lived in <unk> until the end of the war. 
and then i moved to america to <unk> 
and i called miss <unk> for years. 
but i couldn't answer. 
if you love her very much, and you don't know where she is, why don't you just go out and ask her

<unk> <unk> 
i feel something inside me that i can't <unk> 
but, uh... 
nice <unk> 
nice <unk> 
i know you're <unk> and it might be hard to make changes for a <unk> 
and again, none of this has anything to do with <unk> 
this is for <unk>

i think we should <unk> him after we have <unk> evidence. 
what about <unk> 
he says he killed his wife. 
you let <unk> <unk> <unk> his <unk> 
<unk> i have something to <unk> 
we don't want to <unk> any more.

after the <unk> of little <unk> the united states government <unk> the <unk> of the united states government in <unk> to <unk> and <unk> for <unk> 
hold the <unk> 
but despite the <unk> of the united states against the united states <unk> the <unk> were getting worse. 
<unk> <unk> sitting <unk> and crazy <unk> <unk> 
you're a man with a strong heart. 
but i'm tired. 
<unk> 
the local americans are <unk> and the <unk> are <unk> and yet they are not <unk> 
it was hard to get a chance to get there for <unk> back then. 
lots of women and <unk> <unk> 
the united states has been the first to save global <unk> from the golden <unk> 
the solution was <unk> 
i had a lot of <unk> in the mexican <unk> for a long time. 
but it was not possible for people to be hungry enough to walk into a <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> <unk> are <unk> to 40 dollars in the east <unk> 
they bought a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
these <unk> <unk> are incredibly <unk> 
we're talking about millions of <unk> <unk> <unk> and thousands of <unk> <unk> 
in new <unk> one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> one of <unk> <unk> men of <unk> <unk> 
his story starts at <unk> miles <unk> 
billy never knew his father. 
she was in new york with her mother at <unk> 
for years the <unk> stopped <unk> 
what do you want? 
<unk> 
leave the bottle. 
we had different cowboy <unk> 
always <unk> around the corner. 
<unk> <unk> 
billy used what he was doing the best he could to make <unk> 
billy the <unk> a very good <unk> 
he used every dollar he <unk> to buy <unk> for practice. 
only the strong ones can survive in this place. 
where are you going? 
<unk> 
i was just passing through. 
this <unk> belongs to john <unk> 
then john <unk> can come and get his <unk> back. 
if you let me go, it's your choice. 
i don't think so. 
i don't think you have a choice. 
young <unk> <unk> billy the <unk> has been <unk> by a <unk> farm that he tried to steal from. 
most people don't sleep on the floor as they speak. 
you still haven't told me who you're working for. 
i'm not working for anyone. 
everybody works for lincoln <unk> son. 
yeah, but i'm not working. 
if you try to get me what you want, i will look like a man.
you're right. 
there's only one problem, and so am i. 
so many men. 
you got room for one more? 
billy the kid needed a job when he came to the <unk> 
john <unk> needed my help. 
john henry <unk> came to the west to make a fortune. 
money <unk> lincoln <unk> <unk> 
but in this case, some of the powerful men were killed. 
lincoln was one of the <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> everything from government <unk> 
they're not even <unk> by the law. 
most of the <unk> in the <unk> have been used as <unk> <unk> 
john henry <unk> has been in town for a long time, <unk> with <unk> <unk> 
no one is <unk> 
<unk> became the man that john henry <unk> was involved with. 
within a few months, the young <unk> became the most reliable <unk> 
for the first time in your life, you look like a <unk> <unk> 
<unk> was <unk> for billy the <unk> 
<unk> <unk> billy. 
thank you. 
i'm starving. 
everything is going very well, son. 
i'm glad you're here. 
thank you. 
billy was always so <unk> 
it was used as a <unk> team of many people. 
it was amazing and <unk> for a <unk> <unk> 
while billy the kid is now a part of the <unk> <unk> <unk> as america's <unk> <unk> a few hundred miles to <unk> one man is doing everything he can to hold off western <unk> 
take it easy, guys. 
<unk> <unk> my left hand. 
if i didn't do that, i wouldn't be here today. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
when they took us to the <unk> <unk> they actually took people's soul. 
don't touch me! 
he's talking to me. 
god is <unk> 
this is <unk> <unk> 
but i think they wanted to make us <unk> 
there was a <unk> <unk> 
kill <unk> and kill people. 
if you destroy <unk> you may not be a better man. 
they thought we were <unk> 
<unk> knew the <unk> had to <unk> for the people of <unk> 
<unk> we're happy here. 
"i'm not happy here! 
living on the <unk> <unk> 
you're not a <unk> <unk> 
give it time. 
i'm sure you'll understand in time. 
in <unk> the united states government began to <unk> the <unk> of a new indian <unk> in <unk> <unk> 
the united states is <unk> with crazy <unk> 
one of those crazy <unk> wanted to kill a <unk> that came to visit him. 
the united states government is <unk> for a new <unk> 
he went to see his name in the <unk> to clear the name of <unk> <unk> fear that something crazy was going to happen to
crazy <unk> united states <unk> <unk> 
you may have noticed the situation <unk> 
they wanted to put him in prison <unk> 
then he took off his <unk> 
although different <unk> i think the most reliable <unk> is that the white u.s. <unk> <unk> him. 
crazy horse is <unk> in <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
on september 5, <unk> crazy horse, a man who fought his entire life to protect his people and won battle after battle against the united states. 
it's hard to talk about crazy <unk> death, because after so many years, we've been so <unk> 
one of the things that's most fascinating about crazy horse and his <unk> is simply the fact that of all the many indian <unk> in american history. 
the united states government has <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> as a brave <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
i think that's why he's so strong. 
in the death of crazy <unk> <unk> the people of <unk> <unk> were a leader of the <unk> <unk> 
until the house is paid off, we'll be able to pay off their <unk> 
this is for you. 
what about <unk> 
i'm not really into it. 
just the <unk> 
understood. 
go check it out. 
you stay here. 
okay. 
what's the <unk> <unk> 
we heard a shot. 
really? 
don't do anything stupid, son. 
this has nothing to do with you. 
it's <unk> to stay like this. 
the <unk> between this competition is always <unk> 
but like most of the <unk> <unk> this became personal. 
when someone was killed, it became personal. 
that person was john henry <unk> 
he was killed because of the <unk> 
now it's personal. 
john <unk> death was <unk> to find <unk> <unk> 
this road leads to a <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> 
as the country continues to <unk> men like billy the <unk> have noticed their <unk> <unk> 
but a man from new york <unk> miles south to bring in the <unk> 
no one was more <unk> than a man who knew what they wanted and who knew that every day was a chance to survive. 
he was big enough for the <unk> century. 
he was very <unk> with that <unk> 
<unk> <unk> was one of thousands of <unk> who <unk> west to get rich. 
no <unk> west <unk> <unk> 
you always said you had to cross the next line. 
this border would be <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> 
<unk> life isn't like that. 
he did everything he could to get it. 
ray <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> even <unk> <unk> 
to take the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> we had to <unk> the <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> 
so it came out of the speed <unk> 
a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> into a hotel in <unk> 
i refuse to come to this <unk> young men drink <unk> and <unk> 
so you had good <unk> and plenty of <unk> 
that's one of the reasons <unk> was <unk> 
<unk> saw that <unk> was not law and that the <unk> were <unk> 
she had a tough life. 
you can either go back to <unk> or you'll feel worse. 
but <unk> knew that <unk> was more important than <unk> 
we thought the <unk> would be an important <unk> <unk> 
you got the wrong guy. 
that's my <unk> 
this man is a <unk> 
calm down. 
he <unk> 
calm down. 
he <unk> 
put the gun down.

<unk> <unk> <unk> 
what's going on? 
don't ask me. 
john, he asked me to find a few <unk> for you in court so i told him that you were <unk> 
without <unk> you're no good. 
cute but useless. 
you gave him <unk> 
i'm kind of his <unk> 
we'll take care of you. 
don't go behind my back. 
you're giving him advice when he <unk> me? 
does john know you're never gonna forgive me? 
<unk> 
does john know you've never kissed me? 
no, no. 
<unk> 
<unk> isn't it <unk> 
very <unk> 
i was going to call you one day, but john <unk> was born today. 
great. 
<unk> <unk> 
no, <unk> 
now he knows i'm trying to get rid of <unk> 
he said you'd never forgive him. 
not just in this case, not in any way. 
she did? 
yeah. 
<unk> <unk> john. 
did he say he would never forgive him? 
yeah. 
<unk>

i should get you into this. 
no, i don't. 
<unk>

why are you here? 
i thought we could hang out together. 
i will not have my head <unk> and i will not allow it.
i saw <unk> 
it was never <unk> 
is everything okay, john? 
you look a little <unk> 
he's trying to get me to <unk> but he doesn't trust me. 
good. 
you want to go to dinner? 
i'd love to. 
not today, but tomorrow. 
great. 
i always liked having children. 
i think i need <unk> and my <unk> <unk> 
but you promised to have <unk> child. 
you want me to kill him. 
the only way to <unk> his genetic <unk> 
the mr. paul <unk> who lived there as <unk> was very <unk> 
your honor, i'd like to stand <unk> 
mr. paul, sit down. 
mr. <unk> don't <unk> 
a lot of people don't like the idea of <unk> <unk> 
but i am not some <unk> <unk> <unk> 
and i know i can't go back to <unk> 
i want to make sure the <unk> are <unk> 
and i don't think i want her to get hurt. 
thank you. 
first of all, i'm sorry for your loss. 
but you like <unk> right? 
this is a total genetic copy of a dead <unk> 
<unk> speech is <unk> 
did <unk> ever mention <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i'll drink to that. 
what about <unk> <unk> 
i can't believe it either. 
but <unk> <unk> <unk> in the idea of making his own decisions. 
it's not the same thing! 
not everything is about <unk> your honor. 
i didn't say that. 
i have enough <unk> without you. 
you never let anybody get your number. 
whatever makes you great, you'll get it back. 
maybe <unk> <unk> him. 
john, <unk> man. 
but remember, <unk> said you never saw him. 
never. 
now the big <unk> 
because this time, i'm going to <unk> his feet. 
whatever happens, you have to find barry <unk> 
yeah. 
yeah. 
come on! 
we grew up together, baby. 
does <unk> know? 
<unk> doesn't help me. 
may i? 
sure. 
just you and me. 
bullshit! 
how is this <unk> 
very impressive. 
we're getting eggs from the <unk> we <unk> in the <unk> 
<unk> <unk> this is <unk> <unk> cell <unk> 
this part is impressive. 
the witness said it was impressive before. 
just this <unk> 
and then every <unk> <unk> a <unk> 
the <unk> too much <unk> 
<unk> <unk> next to the <unk> <unk> 
in that case, <unk> is <unk> 
and the energy <unk> 
what does that mean? 
<unk> shock <unk> kind of <unk> 
i'm trying to understand. 
<unk> was trying to kill the bug and not to mention a <unk> public <unk> 
let's continue. 
you're both <unk> 
after the energy <unk> what happens to <unk> 
the <unk> <unk> energy <unk> <unk> with each other. 
and then i put these in the <unk> <unk> and in the end, there was a baby on the
<unk> 
no, that's very impressive. 
is that really possible? 
most of the <unk> die in <unk> 
but there's no way a <unk> could <unk> 
you already know that, <unk> 
it's also possible for humans. 
how long will this technology take? 
it's here now. 
people like <unk> 
scientists are waiting. 
thanks, doc. 
hey, mark. 
if you think of anything, the <unk> stole mine. 
now i can <unk> you with two <unk> 
i see it. 
maybe another time. 
what's going on? 
i'll tell you about dinner sometime. 
forget it. 
what's the matter with you? 
what's wrong with me? 
i threw myself at you. 
<unk> like a <unk> 
you know what that means to me? 
i made you a <unk> 
i told you i was in love with you last week. 
anyone could have thought such a stupid <unk> 
please. 
i want a little something. 
i need you to be by my side when i am
together, we are <unk> 
just you and me. 
come on! 
<unk> you came to the end. 
what else do you have to do? 
you're here? 
<unk> 
which is why i'm starting the day with <unk> <unk> 
he was here. 
who? 
barry <unk> here. 
forgive me for not <unk> that. 
<unk> 
it's not what it used to be. 
if there are others in the room, we can't find him.
most people don't dance with <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i always loved him. 
when the crowd <unk> i met him. 
no, here's what you should do. 
get him alone in the <unk> 
first you take it out of the <unk> then you move on between people and people. 
i don't know if i can. 
<unk> 
without <unk> you're nothing. 
look at this. 
that's how you live your life. 
i have no choice but to <unk> 
her name is <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> is so <unk> 
this is what i do to <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
even if it's one egg like <unk> it's different from the same <unk> 
even when someone takes your <unk> you need a warrant. 
<unk> <unk> is a far more <unk> <unk> 
it means breaking into their <unk> 
i'm sorry. 
was that mine? 
i didn't mean to <unk> 
<unk> happened. 
don't you want to see the <unk> <unk> 
<unk> like him, <unk> like him. 
i wonder if she wanted this. 
they've had genetic <unk> all along. 
i can totally explain this. 
never. 
you have <unk> too. 
i want some <unk> 
<unk> 
it's the first time we actually talk. 
i feel so good for her. 
but hurry up. 
i'm the one whose feet are <unk> 
barry <unk> <unk> 
any <unk> 
<unk> 
<unk> your own <unk> 
<unk> is closer to court and my <unk> a little <unk> 
i have no idea. 
<unk> 
things are <unk> 
would you stop <unk> me? 
you think that's what i'm doing? 
i didn't ignore you. 
i thought you weren't coming. 
you were right. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i haven't seen this <unk> since <unk> 
i <unk> because you lied to me. 
you're here because i'm not talking to you. 
it's hard to believe that <unk> isn't happy around here. 
<unk> it's hard to be a girl. 
i don't understand why you do it every day. 
well, obviously we're both a little <unk> 
so why don't we start over? 
you may be right. 
<unk> too. 
<unk> 
how are you? 
no <unk> 
it's definitely <unk> <unk> isn't it? 
something's wrong. 
yes, it is. 
nobody but you and me 
he's a funny little man, isn't he? 
it's all right with me. 
<unk> 
it's like being dr. <unk> 
don't start <unk> <unk> 
dna <unk> 
these are terrible. 
wayne could be <unk> with <unk> <unk> 
a <unk> mike <unk> <unk> 
<unk> 
<unk> 
but the truth is that every time the science is <unk> the <unk> will be <unk> 
we've already made babies <unk> your honor. 
<unk> <unk> 
this technology is <unk> 
is there a risk of <unk> <unk> 
of course, there is. 
<unk> knows his wife <unk> and <unk> 
where they have together. 
this <unk> will give us a chance to <unk> their family <unk> 
we have to be open to a <unk> that will allow a <unk> to have a child.
<unk> can't have his <unk> can he? 
mr. <unk> you may also have been able to <unk> <unk> without the <unk> of the dead wife's <unk> 
i'm saying this because mr. paul said something wrong about <unk> <unk> 
but there's no reason to believe that. 
i'm not sure when to <unk> 
now it's your turn. 
it may not be a legal <unk> 
but there is a moral <unk> 
that's the point. 
then why are you standing there? 
he loved his mother too. 
<unk> 
one day <unk> sand <unk> big <unk> 
<unk> was trying to sell the <unk> 
barry <unk> you were a <unk> to your brother in <unk> 
once the technology <unk> its <unk> <unk> will the <unk> be in its <unk> 
a <unk> heart attack. 
<unk> baby idea was known as <unk> 
now your life is <unk> and <unk> 
we have reason to destroy the <unk> of life on earth. 
this could be real. 
but if you want to <unk> a person, you can <unk> a medical <unk> into a <unk> <unk>
<unk> 
i'm sorry. 
i appreciate your <unk> 
i don't want <unk> 
hi. 
hi. 
you come here <unk> 
this is my access code. 
it's a terrible <unk> 
has it ever worked before? 
better. 
you want to go to the bar? 
not tonight. 
<unk> <unk> 
it's not that. 
to tell you the truth, i didn't wanna win this time. 
no, i want to be alone tonight. 
you can talk to him. 
not at all. 
like you said, most people don't dance with <unk> <unk> 
you're not crazy. 
honestly, i'm a little <unk> 
something <unk> something in the real world. 
hey. 
maybe the three of us will win. 
give me a chance. 
if he <unk> i'm still here. 
okay, i'll do that. 
let's go. 
who knew <unk> <unk> would be the <unk> party in <unk> 
you talked to <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
let's just say that in the <unk> never <unk> 
<unk> called <unk> and he said... 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
sam, we've been <unk> for 30 years, but we haven't <unk> a hand yet. 
your favorite table is ready. 
ladies love a good <unk> danny.

you think you can get any girl you want? 
get him. 
you can't be alone, man. 
<unk> is here for the virgin mary. 
<unk> girls who aren't <unk> are pure <unk> 
card <unk> this month, two <unk> <unk> and the last <unk> report says it's a big <unk> 
there's a card <unk> downstairs. 
<unk> thinks it may be a card <unk> 
maybe we should continue this conversation later, say, <unk> 
<unk> it's been three and you've been here a week. 
<unk> <unk> and <unk> permission to <unk> 
listen, i'm sorry, but this is a <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> for every <unk> 
all right, the gift bags are <unk> and waiting for the <unk> to go. 
the <unk> brought the <unk> and the rest of them will arrive tomorrow. 
however, for some reason, <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for future <unk> 
mary, don't worry. 
i'm sure everything will be fine. 
you're the <unk> man i've ever met. 
thanks for coming, <unk> 
that's a <unk> <unk> 
a hundred thousand <unk> 
like i said, it's been a pleasure. 
<unk> <unk> is so <unk>

<unk> you have access to a table and <unk> <unk> right? 
suspect is <unk> red <unk> yellow <unk> 
thank you. 
mr. <unk> i'm from <unk>

this night is over, and so do you. 
all right. 
i told <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> must be like some delicious chicken that <unk> <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> have been using it for months, and they're using it to make the biggest and most <unk> wedding ever. 
come on. 
even <unk> was always the boss. 
why are you so <unk> 
if you refuse to play the <unk> the <unk> will still be in front of us, and that's all i can
let's go, everybody. 
<unk> guy told us that <unk> <unk> told us a dozen of his <unk> 
<unk> can point out the <unk> and prove the game is rich. 
the <unk> out there are rarely <unk> all night long. 
and close your eyes, <unk> 
she stood up a minute before <unk> <unk> into a game and played like <unk> 
<unk> 
even playing cards aren't illegal. 
that's technically true. 
but <unk> has a different sense of justice. 
like in the past, i could <unk> a <unk> in the desert. 
i'll be honest with you, i'm an old-fashioned man. 
please. 
now that we have the <unk> it's black <unk> 
<unk> if you don't go in there, they'll take you as special. 
you hear that? 
hey, jack! 
the guy <unk> us to <unk> <unk> 
as long as <unk> has no <unk> you know he's not illegal and i don't have it. 
at least you had some fun with him. 
it's not the end of the story. 
it's not the end of anything until someone <unk> them and <unk> them. 
i'm mike from last night, <unk> 
<unk> man. 
there are other <unk> you're not there. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
it's <unk> but i gotta go. 
<unk> and <unk> right? 
you finally said something to <unk> 
i think it's about you because you're usually right. 
then, what? 
maybe you're just a little upset because you're so beautiful. 
<unk> 
you know what we're gonna do? 
what is it? 
we need to sit down and try to figure out why we don't have a
<unk> 
almost there. 
you think i'm okay? 
whether you're good or not. 
you <unk> 
please. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> told me not to come back this morning, but there's no record of you going there.

i think he thought i was <unk> 
<unk> always <unk> his <unk> 
look, i was <unk> for five minutes of work, and i didn't have to take my clothes off. 
why are you so <unk> 
because <unk> and his friends were <unk> some kind of card <unk> 
i thought they were just some rich kids. 
somebody's behind this and i need to find out who it is. 
do you have any idea who wrote this and who did it? 
i once met one of them. 
yeah, we called him <unk>

how old do you think these kids are? 
no bigger than <unk> <unk> 
danny, this is what you wanted. 
we'll see. 
they all have <unk> and <unk> cards. 
then you must have <unk> <unk> and <unk> children. 
then we find out how we can stop them. 
i started my local business as soon as i knew how the second team got here. 
because you're a great guy, and i have an interest in other <unk> 
maybe change is wrong.

i sent you three messages and you didn't answer my question. 
i think after five months of sleeping together, you should have listened to me while the rest of your class left. 
look, i know you don't hate <unk> 
i accept this <unk> 
but this morning, i woke up at your place, alone, which means i sneak out of the house. 
the <unk> <unk> the internal <unk> until <unk> <unk> 
i got another cup of coffee with this one, <unk>

i speak a little <unk> 
yeah, i don't know what you said. 
actually, <unk> is quite <unk> 
<unk> 
<unk> 
did you hear what i just said? 
i didn't. 
let me see that talk. 
i think <unk> <unk> is wearing black <unk> 
so when do we start? 
i don't think he ever will. 
and i wouldn't listen to that song. 
the ice is still there. 
yeah, i know. 
it doesn't seem sad to me. 
this is your life <unk> 
you never wanted someone to be emotionally <unk> on you, wondering how you are, where you are, kissing you in the morning, waiting for you to get home at night. 
what's so good about <unk> on your birthday? 
but you give your own birth to big <unk> 
i've never been alone. 
i'm not sure what i should do now. 
i'll go, and you go to <unk> <unk> 
thank you. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
don't sing that song. 
i think we should have dinner to celebrate my birthday. 
that would be a good excuse for our relationship. 
i think we should be together. 
i can't work this out, <unk> 
why did you let me go first? 
you go first. 
from now on, you start all the <unk> 
we were seeing other people, remember? 
<unk> 
he's my best friend. 
part of me wants to live with me. 
he wants <unk> 
he wants <unk> 
<unk> is a man, right? 
<unk> 
look, i... 
<unk> <unk> 
you should see other people. 
you ask me questions about myself and you take care of <unk> 
what bothers me is i thought we were the same. 
i thought you were emotionally <unk> 
how did he react when you told him? 
he was already a very happy man. 
that would make him <unk> 
you were with me. 
we were talking about <unk> 
honey, i'm not the right woman for you. 
you're too <unk> for fun. 
but no one can be true for you because you only think of yourself. 
what was that? 
i think the <unk> came through my head. 
i can't be <unk> <unk> 
i guess. 
you know what the worst thing is? 
i don't think of anyone but myself. 
it's impossible for me to meet other people. 
i feel like the <unk> needs to be <unk> but i have no idea how to explain it. 
i'm in trouble, man. 
<unk> <unk> right? 
yeah. 
well, what about it? 
i think it's <unk> 
come on, man. 
<unk> 
hi, ben. 
hi. 
very attractive man.

come on, <unk> 
it's almost over.

<unk> where's the kid? 
especially when i wanted a child. 
there's a boy over there. 
<unk> 
yeah. 
yeah. 
thank you. 
i am <unk> 
people often ask me why i love children so much. 
maybe he never had his own <unk> 
i believe that what we want to live with is the happiness of our <unk> and the lives of those who live in
they're the most important <unk> of the <unk> because they're <unk> 
they do it for you, they do it <unk> 
or i started to believe that you had a life that you could only live for yourself. 
it was <unk> but this particular <unk> had written a little song. 
it was really nice of you to move that part of the <unk> 
sometimes it's a real pleasure to work with you. 
i'm <unk> happy right now. 
on the count of three, everyone will be <unk> and <unk> 
<unk> 
oh, my god!

i'm pretty sure you got the right guy. 
all right. 
what a wonderful moment. 
i've never done this before. 
what if i'm not ready? 
what if he just thinks he wants me?

<unk> one little thing is <unk> 
the children expect to be <unk> captain. 
i didn't know it was <unk> 
you took my baby and you took my <unk> away. 
<unk> was <unk> and then everyone started <unk> 
<unk> 
because i hear you're a <unk> 
maybe you can do something good for <unk> for a long time. 
because i don't care what the others say.

<unk> this is my <unk> 
<unk> you ready for the second <unk>

i can do that, and i will. 
we have a chance to make a clear shot. 
have a seat, <unk> with other <unk> 
what about <unk> 
okay, <unk> you're up.

i know what you're thinking, but you have to do something else than control the team. 
like i did right now? 
<unk> i need you to be more serious. 
you're more concerned about <unk> than the others. 
to tell you the truth, i <unk> you. 
but i can't. 
i'm really gonna miss you, <unk> 
thank you. 
what did you want to tell me? 
just...

mom told me what happened. 
i'm really sorry about the <unk> 
i'll tell him i'll be better off with a <unk> 
i don't think there's gonna be a next time. 
because i'm a <unk> i don't blame him. 
so you're taking a funny woman out of <unk> 
no, that's my mom. 
and a guy who goes out with him gets a lot of <unk> 
i'll deal with him. 
it would be safe to <unk> him. 
what's wrong with me? 
maybe you're just too smart and too <unk> 
winning is important to you. 
oh, my god, i shouldn't have done this. 
but what does that tell me? 
the <unk> of the room and no one's talking to me about it. 
it's like danny did it. 
yeah, none of us seem to be <unk> 
yeah, i guess i could say that once or a thousand times. 
right. 
right. 
i was thinking about a <unk> change for <unk> 
i've never <unk> 
yeah, i think you and i can figure out how to find the real <unk> without me. 
ben, nobody wants me.

<unk> <unk> <unk> 
what's <unk> doing? 
you used it as a <unk> 
i warned you to watch the inside. 
<unk> why are you involved in this murder? 
mr. <unk> i suggest you answer another question. 
you left <unk> alone with your wife's body. 
no sign of forced <unk> 
i saw the man who did this to <unk> 
<unk> was designed to create <unk> on a chemical <unk> 
these <unk> are worth a hundred billion dollars. 
michael, this is daniel <unk> 
we have a problem. 
the world's third largest energy <unk> 
did you tell anyone about us? 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
the district attorney tried to <unk> a mass <unk> 
so you've been <unk> over <unk> <unk> over the last three years? 
why didn't you <unk> 
i was wondering the same thing, but i don't know how to trap <unk> <unk> 
what did you find out about <unk> 
we need to make sure that the <unk> still <unk> 
i'm fine with that. 
i know it's your dream <unk> but don't come back. 
we're all <unk> 
it might help me. 
you have no authority to <unk> 
when he tries to steal something, we must <unk> him. 
it's the first time. 
you know, the other night, i was wondering if someone <unk> <unk> 
isn't it your job to find out, <unk> 
let's see if we can find something that <unk> the <unk> 
mr. <unk> is not here to be <unk> 
always <unk> 
this is a very important <unk> mr. <unk> 
you find the ring and you find my wife's <unk> 
mr. <unk> i believe you. 
because the person who killed <unk> is still out there, and you have absolutely nothing to do with it. 
don't hold this against me. 
don't answer that. 
i could swear that it didn't look like <unk> 
the only thing that happened three years ago was not possible <unk> 
no, but it's like he's lying about everything. 
i mean, he went home twice and nothing was stolen. 
was there no harm in <unk> <unk> 
i was on the phone a couple times, but i think i got <unk> 
she wants me to meet the guy she was with. 
if you have something to say, <unk> ready to be <unk> 
whatever his company is up to, it better not be anything but stolen <unk> 
if you're wondering what happened to <unk> <unk> look at <unk> <unk> 
my only job is to protect mr. <unk> and if you do anything to expose him or <unk> <unk> 
everything okay in new york? 
daniel <unk> head of <unk> <unk> 
do you have any reason to believe that <unk> <unk> was part of <unk> <unk> 
i've seen a lot of <unk> die these days. 
17 years ago, she was considered an expert witness to daniel <unk> so she could win a case. 
then why did you <unk> that the <unk> report was <unk> to 100 <unk> 
daniel <unk> was a brilliant man, but he was with <unk> when he came to <unk> 
no, this is just another big <unk> that you need to <unk> 
when i asked you about <unk> <unk> you pulled me over. 
i'll tell you what i want to know. 
i don't know who killed your wife, but you are responsible for that. 
he and <unk> worked together before <unk> <unk>

it's called <unk> and then <unk> <unk> 
the bad cops are just <unk> with a gun on their own. 
and the good cops found him with a gun in his hands. 
thank you for your career <unk> 
hey, listen, <unk>

<unk> <unk> 
why have we come so early? 
what kind of <unk> do you have such a <unk> 
this little town is between the <unk> 
i mean, it's far from <unk> to the nearest police. 
no <unk> <unk> 
not even the <unk> we're here. 
just in case. 
hello. 
don't worry about armed men. 
<unk> likes to make sure no one knows what's coming. 
<unk> 
it's so good to see you. 
looks like you're doing a little job. 
put the <unk> down. 
on your knees. 
<unk> 
i said, <unk> on the <unk> 
hey, hey, hey, hey <unk>

son of a bitch. 
i should have killed you when i had the chance.

i can't do this anymore. 
you can't bring <unk> in here. 
open your eyes. 
did you get my <unk> 
come on! 
come on!

a large <unk> could <unk> them. 
come on! 
what the hell? 
do you have a plan <unk> 
come on, run! 
kill them! 
<unk> <unk> son of a bitch! 
<unk> doesn't like the plan. 
it's a little early for you to come visit here, isn't it, <unk> 
i heard about dan <unk> <unk> <unk> 
what happened? 
it's about <unk> 
i don't usually go to warm places. 
there was an address on <unk> desk last night. 
hey! 
we had an agreement. 
good afternoon. 
looks like you're in some kind of trouble. 
it's not as bad as it looks. 
i think we should leave now. 
don't come near me again. 
let's go! 
who are these guys? 
i don't know, and i don't care. 
just kill them all and bring me the <unk> 
cover me. 
i'll call <unk> and get backup. 
lieutenant <unk> 
yes, <unk> 
i'm <unk> <unk> 
i haven't checked in for six hours. 
what <unk> 
it won't be long, okay? 
<unk> <unk> and i need <unk> 
code 3, how many <unk> can we <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> 30 minutes <unk> 
okay, heavy fire <unk> 
that's six hours, <unk> 
what the hell are you doing there? 
long story. 
just as many guys as <unk> okay? 
too late, man. 
we're too late. 
this stupid deal happened five minutes ago. 
what's the address? 
there's got to be somewhere around here. 
man, come on. 
here? 
yeah. 
it's in the back. 
i just <unk> 
it's not a safe <unk> 
then you say <unk> 
<unk> will arrive in 20 minutes. 
sounds about right. 
the bad guys are on their way to <unk> 
so we sit on the road to <unk> 
good idea, <unk> 
<unk> 
look out! 
if i'm right, it must be in a real car! 
ready? 
i'm waiting for <unk> <unk> 
let's go! 
get in. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
don't you know how to <unk> 
what did they do to you? 
<unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
son of a bitch!

can't you ask him to go any <unk> 
he had a good <unk> <unk> 
this car's <unk> 
maybe it would have been better if you hadn't taken the <unk> 
want some? 
<unk> when did you get that <unk> 
you were there, so i came back to <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
son of a bitch! 
i want that <unk> 
i don't think it's a very good situation anymore. 
what, you think i already <unk>

that's exactly what i wanted it to be. 
that's what <unk> me.

<unk> 
<unk>

yes, <unk> 
come on! 
okay.

<unk> take <unk> 
what the hell was that? 
<unk> 
i'm a <unk> 
it looked like a <unk> <unk> 12 <unk> 
anyway, he's headed this way. 
no sign of <unk> 
what about <unk> 
no sign of him. 
looks like he took it with him. 
no <unk> 
and wayne <unk> to testify against <unk> 
and i'm sure that's what he said. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> 
well, that'll do. 
yeah, but you know what's at <unk> 
i had no interest in such a thing. 
it just happened. 
you came all the way out here for me? 
no. 
i came all this way to see wayne <unk> 
i'm so sorry, jack. 
well, i set up a sports car and a <unk> on fire. 
<unk> have you thought about this? 
we've got a guy in south <unk> 
did you know that <unk> lived there? 
<unk> here. 
dan doesn't like pure <unk> okay? 
it's hard to <unk> 
<unk> i can't say. 
what do you mean? 
don't come near me again. 
cover me. 
i'll call <unk> and get backup. 
yes, <unk> 
i'm <unk> <unk> 
it won't be long, okay? 
code 3, how many <unk> can we <unk> 
hey, <unk> 
sorry to keep you waiting. 
how much is this door <unk> 
five dollars. 
that's <unk> 
that's el <unk> 
i'll give you three. 
okay. 
here. 
three dollars. 
how much is <unk> 
50 <unk> 
why did i do that? 
<unk> 
i'm not saying <unk> 
what made you change your mind? 
well, it's gonna be all right, <unk> right? 
yeah. 
yeah. 
you're wasting your time. 
i brought you the best <unk> 
this is the best heroin money can buy. 
that's <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
here. 
<unk> the <unk> 
well, listen. 
stop. 
wayne young returned in 48 hours, 
it's all <unk> 
actually, <unk> 
all i have to do is... 
like i said, being a cop is a team. 
but there is no life in the <unk> of great <unk> 
the <unk> here are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
200 tons of <unk> 30 <unk> and the biggest <unk> ever. 
despite their giant <unk> the blue <unk> are the most <unk> and <unk> of all <unk> 
the <unk> can travel over <unk> a day. 
he <unk> his massive mouth more than he could <unk> so he makes it rich and <unk> when he sees one. 
here, <unk> <unk> are often too <unk> 
when it's all over, we'll go to <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> must be light in the <unk> because the other sea <unk> are <unk> with heavy <unk> 
the small <unk> <unk> the <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> dead <unk> 
with the extra power of the <unk> the flying <unk> suddenly <unk> more than once. 
a good <unk> is hundreds of <unk> 
all open ocean <unk> are designed to search for food. 
so <unk> <unk> 
this <unk> has to lie between <unk> and <unk> 
these <unk> who have no <unk> are going to see the <unk> of baby <unk> who are trying to <unk> these <unk> 
it's my first opportunity in weeks. 
only <unk> can make a move when it's a few miles away. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
the open <unk> are so <unk> that some <unk> can only be found in a <unk> <unk> 
<unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> 
we worked together through a vast <unk> of ocean. 
small <unk> sometimes <unk> <unk> <unk> 
it's a form of <unk> to find the <unk> 
but most of these little <unk> have been <unk> in the middle of the ocean where the ocean had been <unk>
only when they get to the surface to <unk> they become <unk> 
when you spend a lot of time in the big <unk> you can't <unk> any other <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to prevent <unk> from <unk> the safe <unk> 
down here, food is <unk> than is <unk> so the <unk> of our precious <unk> will do everything in your power to protect your precious <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> is the highest <unk> of the <unk> <unk> 
in order to capture <unk> <unk> <unk> we have a similar <unk> <unk> <unk> 
this deep water <unk> the long, <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> 
the open <unk> may be a wide blue <unk> but like every desert has its <unk> 
sea <unk> deep ocean <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
success here depends on sensitive <unk> 
<unk> in a straight line of <unk> a false sense of trust. 
the lion <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> so it is hard to <unk> how he is so close to <unk> 
he used the <unk> he used to hide slow and <unk> <unk> and then he <unk> it even better. 
the <unk> <unk> that <unk> many <unk> <unk> also <unk> this <unk> <unk> 
as part of an <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> are <unk> hundreds of miles away from the <unk> 
both dogs travel between <unk> <unk> and other <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> 
i don't know why a lot of <unk> are so <unk> but these <unk> are definitely coming for food. 
if these little <unk> get close to the <unk> the dog <unk> them. 
as long as the silver <unk> are close to the ocean <unk> the <unk> <unk> will be <unk>
<unk> are never easy to eat. 
here, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
black <unk> <unk> are the same size as <unk> <unk> but three <unk> are in a different <unk> so they need a completely different <unk> 
the longest <unk> of <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> and this is the <unk> of the southern polar <unk> 
first, we must <unk> our <unk> to his <unk> <unk> his <unk> 
then we turn around and watch the wind <unk> 
most times when we were looking for <unk> we had no time at sea. 
since the <unk> are so strong here, the water <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> 
they can be as <unk> as a <unk> so they can be <unk> on the south polar bear <unk> 
like all <unk> <unk> have to <unk> in the <unk> but the south <unk> are so few in their current <unk> 
each year nearly half a million <unk> comes here to <unk> the <unk> 
in a few days a <unk> would be more than happy to have you back. 
time to head out to sea on the <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> was so <unk> that only the <unk> were strong enough to <unk> 
the <unk> <unk> like an ocean <unk> but under the <unk> there's a constant <unk> of <unk> <unk> 
these <unk> are more <unk> than any other <unk> life on the planet. 
all the <unk> of <unk> <unk> are <unk> to this <unk> 
the <unk> little plant and animals brought together to form a <unk> of fresh <unk> 
the <unk> are <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> are moving up a couple of <unk> <unk> moving forward. 
the <unk> carrying the <unk> <unk> also sees the <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> between ocean <unk> where the <unk> <unk> 
each <unk> has an extraordinary sense of <unk> <unk> left by <unk> <unk> 
great fish <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> 
they think they're <unk> 
when the attack comes, the <unk> move as one. 
each fish will <unk> immediately to the <unk> of the <unk> and the whole <unk> will act <unk> 
even when more sea <unk> came in, they were <unk> like <unk> <unk> 
the sea <unk> should be able to <unk> a smaller <unk> than this <unk> 
but with so little <unk> i can still feel the <unk> 
all the sea <unk> can do is keep the <unk> <unk> and the others to fight for themselves. 
<unk> <unk> the <unk> so we can <unk> a <unk> <unk> escape <unk> 
the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> 
<unk> <unk> will arrive in less than an hour. 
<unk> once again will disappear into his own <unk> 
these blue <unk> are still <unk> for <unk> <unk> 
in order to be this big she has to find four <unk> of food a day. 
if we can get a crowd of <unk> to the surface because of the <unk>
this blue <unk> has finally found what he's been looking for. 
a <unk> <unk> to open your big mouth. 
the <unk> <unk> are hundreds of <unk> and the <unk> are <unk> 
the <unk> <unk> are <unk> through the <unk> of the <unk> 
in full <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> lives in <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> 
but it takes time to <unk> all that water. 
blue <unk> may not be as <unk> as other <unk> but they don't need to be. 
no other <unk> is more <unk> than the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> 
blue <unk> the greatest <unk> in the world. 
<unk> <unk> created a lot of <unk> in the <unk> 
<unk> this was a <unk> mission. 
<unk> worked with john <unk> the world's most important blue <unk> <unk> 
john got vital information on these <unk> <unk> 
part of this <unk> and part of the reason that, uh, we're working with <unk> is that it gives us a unique chance to <unk> scientific <unk> 
so we are doing this under our research <unk> how we <unk> how we <unk> how we <unk> how we <unk> how we <unk> 
your team depends on a good <unk> <unk> 
it was very <unk> and the <unk> were completely <unk> 
<unk> 
the first year i had weak <unk> the bad <unk> and the <unk> was <unk> 
the second year is better than <unk> 
the blue <unk> will be on the surface of the <unk> only to a <unk> minute before it <unk> 
he should be trying to get the boat to the <unk> but not in front of it. 
and then the <unk> went into the water and stopped the <unk> long enough to be <unk> 
this year the water is <unk> clean but it takes a good time to <unk> 
after weeks of <unk> all the <unk> finally comes together and gives you the opportunity to live a lifetime. 
the <unk> was <unk> <unk> it took too long. 
i mean, it was so <unk> like a <unk> train. 
the blue <unk> of the water is so rare that the <unk> of the <unk> is <unk> to <unk> an enormous <unk> 
this series is all about <unk> and so nice though it is to have that shot to make a <unk> we've got to get shots of blue <unk> eating <unk> 
and we have to wait for <unk> to be completely on the surface. 
maybe once or twice a month. 
<unk> <unk> is coming into a <unk> <unk> but a rather <unk> <unk> 
<unk> look at that <unk> 
let's go take a look. 
look at this <unk> 
i'm still not really in the mood for a <unk> <unk> 
david <unk> turned him into a camera. 
he took a <unk> came up and took a big <unk> 
the reason i gave them blue <unk> was because they were <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the ocean. 
i went upstairs to get another <unk> and it was <unk> and it was <unk> last time. 
it was probably <unk> less than ten minutes, but it was the greatest thing i've ever seen in <unk> <unk> 
sharing a blue <unk> water and eye contact is something i never do. 
and full <unk> 
yeah, that's never gonna change a unique view of the <unk> 
with this close <unk> the team have <unk> blue <unk> as never before and at last have started to reveal the secret life of the <unk> greatest <unk> 
i don't like him. 
no, i don't. 
<unk> <unk> every friend of mine likes him. 
<unk> right? 
when <unk> was <unk> <unk> it was a list of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
yes, <unk> <unk> 
<unk> plus <unk> <unk> all over school. 
look, i'm coming to stay with you for a while. 
no, don't get yourself in trouble. 
<unk> 
okay. 
double <unk> <unk> 
and <unk> <unk> 
everyone thinks <unk> is a dangerous place. 
<unk> 
i know every rabbit <unk> broken <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
and the pretty <unk> 
the difference is where i am, <unk> 
your wife loves <unk> 
and <unk> 
everybody <unk> 
<unk> join us. 
but <unk> is a completely different world. 
if you think you can change your mind, think again. 
i didn't realize you were actually a <unk> <unk> 
wherever they go, they set a new trap. 
<unk> you smell like christmas. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> everything, <unk> 
could it be any <unk> 
well, according to <unk> 
at least i'm not the first minus the <unk> 
i think i should be grateful for that. 
i'm really sorry, <unk> 
i didn't mean to <unk> you. 
believe me, i'm too old for such <unk> 
here's a nice <unk> 
my brother will break your heart, and when he does that, i won't be there to fix the <unk> 
i promise i won't stay away from him. 
do you think <unk> <unk> the third <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
forgive me. 
yes, a question for you. 
who can tell me the real meaning of <unk> de <unk> 
<unk> de <unk> 
<unk> means dancing. 
but what do you mean by <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> de <unk> 
two <unk> one <unk> 
a man and a woman are pure and the same dance <unk> 
<unk> <unk> about this. 
i never dance with a man before. 
that's right. 
<unk> girls dance with girls. 
there were no men. 
it's just cute creatures that <unk> the <unk> of men in first class. 
<unk> has three important <unk> 
trust. 
shoot one. 
<unk> 
great. 
and, most important of all, <unk> 
without them, yes... 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
remember, we need <unk> and <unk> to <unk> 
are your hands always this <unk> 
i have something to tell you. 
the person you <unk> 
no-one else should matter. 
you want <unk> 
relax. 
you do it well.

i mean, patrick is such a perfect kid. 
don't you think the universe is trying to get us together? 
<unk> 
before you leave, i talked to the rest of the <unk> with miss <unk> 
i'll be right back. 
instead, you'll have to work for me. 
remember, just like any other <unk> this is <unk> 
this is so <unk> 
i'm going to be a <unk> dog. 
at least you don't have to spend 24 hours with <unk> like me. 
i'd rather open my eyes to a blind man. 
i know you ask 20 questions in 24 hours. 
this? 
<unk> any questions? 
"but you must answer <unk> 
it's like i want to know something about <unk> 
so you're not alone. 
<unk> <unk> my favorite dinner <unk> no <unk> and we're finished.

why do guys use the bathroom so bad? 
why do you have to be so bad? 
it's true. 
bad <unk> 
what you did was <unk> and <unk> 
just think it over and finish the job before we both die. 
<unk> would you please write a song or something like that? 
hurry. 
i still don't see why you can't trust everyone in those <unk> 
you're just as <unk> as a <unk> <unk> 
that only made you look bad. 
okay, don't say anything. 
<unk> you <unk> 
hey, where's <unk> 
i don't know. 
<unk> 
<unk> 
hey, baby. 
<unk> has a <unk> room. 
hey! 
you can't do that, <unk> 
come on, i'll see them later. 
you want to die? 
did you not see what they did to me? 
you can't stay here, <unk> 
anyway, what are you still doing here? 
if you want to know, i was expecting <unk> 
how dare you see me in a <unk> 
you don't know anything about me. 
i don't think i want to know. 
i've never met anyone as rude as you. 
didn't your mother teach you <unk> 
he's dead. 
look, if you're <unk> all you have to do is ask. 
who says i'm <unk> 
just checking the <unk> 
what do you know? 
i'll explain everything. 
this <unk> thing must be working. 
yeah? 
can you see this? 
<unk> 
i can't imagine what it's like to lose your mother.

yeah, when he was young. 
is that why you wanted to enter the <unk> 
are you <unk> 
<unk> 
i don't believe you. 
you don't know how you <unk> 
right. 
<unk> lives in <unk> 
very well. 
and let's say i got in trouble. 
i don't know, probably. 
you said you were close. 
so you don't think he <unk> 
why would <unk> help you? 
maybe until we get him. 
the room was just another <unk> so he didn't know it was me. 
now you know everything. 
true or wrong? 
don't take this the wrong way, but... 
see, you didn't do anything. 
<unk> and i are very close. 
i have one question left. 
<unk> question. 
go ahead. 
why don't we ask everyone in the wrong dressing room? 
you knew it was an accident. 
why did you choose this <unk> 
you still lie about that.

the other <unk> is a good example of <unk> <unk> 
now, <unk> seems to have <unk> in cash, but not <unk> 
we have no problem <unk> any <unk> <unk>

what's <unk> <unk> 
all the <unk> coming here. 
did you know that? 
there's a couple of kids from school. 
we have very similar <unk> 
oh, that's good. 
yes, i do, but believe it or not, you may want to work one day, bill. 
mexican <unk> do nothing for you. 
if you want to be a <unk> <unk> you have to have a school with no <unk> 
i'd say i went to <unk> 
i got a <unk> 
i did the right thing. 
two <unk> 
one is <unk> one is <unk> 
i'm going back to new york soon and i want to put this on the road. 
what does your mother think? 
he thinks i can make my own decisions. 
i'm not sure what to say about that. 
we need to talk about this some more. 
i don't understand why. 
i've never talked about it until now, and i know what i want. 
johnny, something's wrong. 
can you come over here and take a look? 
that's enough, mr. <unk> 
you can leave if you like. 
is he okay? 
yeah, she's fine. 
<unk> is starting a <unk> 
not yet. 
any idea what's wrong? 
a few things could happen. 
i suspect <unk> is <unk> 
the problem is whether it's good or not. 
will this <unk> be <unk> 
not completely. 
<unk> not a good sign. 
so this is serious? 
i think we should put him in a general <unk> 
if the problem was serious, father, the <unk> would be <unk> 
i'm going to open you up right now, and i'm going to have to <unk>
if it's just a <unk> it's really a <unk> 
i don't think we should tell mom about this. 
if there's nothing there, why should i be? 
whatever you say, johnny. 
you're the boss. 
she told you, didn't she? 
of course he did. 
then you know it's nothing serious. 
if it's not serious, <unk> you can ask me yourself. 
look, mom, you're gonna have to stay away from that <unk> <unk> 
<unk> on the ground. 
that's why i didn't tell you. 
he says it's just a <unk> 
that's right. 
it's a simple operation <unk> 
yes, it is. 
mom, i could tell you something was wrong. 
sure. 
okay. 
is this how you live here, john, with all your <unk> <unk> 
yeah. 
if you don't accept this <unk> you don't look like it.
<unk> <unk> 
get down. 
you need to hear this, dad. 
what is this? 
i don't have any baseball <unk> 
bad <unk> 
dr. <unk> this is <unk> <unk> 
i was just trying to scare you.

it's not too late? 
<unk> 
are you <unk> dad? 
i'm fine. 
<unk> get some rest. 
it makes you feel like a baby. 
okay. 
remember, if you need anything, just ring the <unk> 
that's it, huh? 
you're gonna be okay. 
you know, john, some of the guys are <unk> <unk> 
we never met. 
a <unk> 
come on. 
i love you, johnny. 
i love you, too, dad. 
well, mr. <unk> i'm afraid you don't.

a few bad <unk> <unk> 
not when you're your father. 
okay, this is gonna be a stupid question, but are you absolutely sure? 
yeah. 
the good thing is we can <unk> him. 
listen, dr. <unk> 
how dare you say that <unk> cancer is <unk> 
it's very <unk> <unk> and it's very <unk> 
say something more <unk> 
calm down, mr. <unk> 
you have no idea what others have been through. 
you can't even take the kids to that. 
i don't underestimate you, doctor. 
i just want to tell her that, that's all. 
isn't that <unk> 
mom, i told you. 
it's just a <unk> and i can't stop it. 
i want to see him. 
mom! 
mom, i can't see him right now. 
will you listen to me? 
this is a form of <unk> 
if all goes well, let me see him. 
<unk> come on, mom! 
john just wants your help. 
you know. 
don't listen to him, mom. 
he's my husband and i will see him. 
now, either you're gonna get me over there or i'm gonna die, but i'm gonna go. 
what's in there? 
<unk> go find dr. <unk> 
come on! 
get out of here. 
what happened to him? 
jake, it's me! 
why didn't you call me? 
<unk> 
mr. <unk> i'm dr. <unk> 
do you know who i am? 
i'm fine. 
i'm fine now, thank you. 
give us 25 <unk> <unk> and check it every two hours. 
yes, doctor. 
this is exactly the same as the other <unk> 
every simple <unk> is often <unk> 
this is <unk> 
do you have any idea what's going on in there? 
i know this is a <unk> experience for you, but what you have to understand is that what we're dealing with here is a <unk> situation. 
when he came here, he was <unk> 
why are you crying now? 
<unk> <unk> 
come and go. 
such <unk> stress is <unk> 
i'm sure you have a nice <unk> and <unk> situation. 
what do we do in the <unk> 
nothing. 
what do you mean, <unk> 
we wait for <unk> to answer the questions. 
did you tell dad you had <unk> 
he has the right to know. 
you don't know exactly what you want from me, mr. <unk> 
dr. <unk> 
i don't trust <unk> 
you're a hospital <unk> and all i want to say is that he can hear us. 
dr. <unk> is a good young <unk> 
it seems that your father is perfectly <unk> and <unk> 
i told him that i would never say that he had cancer to my father because he's too afraid of these <unk> 
but whatever he did, he went right back to him. 
yeah, it's hard for every doctor to say. 
he is the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of your father's <unk> 
i'm sure he had no choice. 
there was a <unk> 
don't <unk> me. 
i know my father. 
why are you <unk> your <unk> 
to make you hurt yourself. 
<unk> <unk> 
well, then, i'm his <unk> and i don't think he needs this. 
give us a call when you're ready, and we'll put him in his place. 
i can't believe this. 
hey, dad, how's it going? 
you always say that? 
look, hey, look, look, i brought <unk> 
and billy is here. 
hey, dad. 
how are you feeling, dad? 
can you hear me? 
hey, <unk> it's billy. 
how's it going? 
god, john, i can't bear to be here looking like this. 
i think that's enough. 
i gave him a <unk> 
that would destroy him. 
how long has he been like that? 
all the time we've been here. 
<unk> 
god, doctor. 
i'm glad you're not a detective. 
yeah, it looked <unk> 
what the hell is going on? 
i meant what you said, mr. <unk> 
mr. <unk> 
you can't keep telling me that he's <unk> doctor. 
it's not <unk> <unk> it's true, but the <unk> will bring it to itself. 
<unk> 
the guy is <unk> 
he's always <unk> 
he doesn't know anyone in his family and you just gave him a <unk> 
why don't you ask him about <unk> 
maybe you should try <unk> 
we decided to <unk> your father tomorrow. 
you can pick him up after <unk> 
what do you mean, <unk> 
you want to tell me about my father's <unk> 
well, of course not, but there's nothing we can do to tell him if he <unk> 
the <unk> are taking the <unk> off the road to <unk> empty <unk> 
how do i look? 
i can't help any of you! 
what exactly do you mean? 
whatever it is. 
which means it's not even <unk> 
what kind of speech is this? 
let me get this straight. 
just relax. 
you want my father out of here? 
you know what? 
i'll do better than you. 
your <unk> <unk> 
john, what are you doing? 
mr. <unk> you can trust him. 
this is not necessary. 
i'm telling you to take her home. 
mr. <unk> this <unk> is <unk> 
what do we do now? 
i don't know. 
we don't have much choice, but we can't. 
no, i don't want to do that. 
i don't want to take her to a <unk> 
me too, john, but we have to do something. 
wait a second, john. 
you can't help her in this. 
i think i can do that. 
i can do better than <unk> 
i'll stay and help. 
no. 
why not? 
i'll take care of her. 
he's my father. 
well, he's my <unk> too. 
and i'm your mother. 
i don't want you here right now, billy. 
you can't do this. 
dad, i'm not a kid. 
look, i think you should go. 
go back to school, go back to mexico. 
you're out of here! 
<unk> 
yeah, i get it. 
i want to talk to him. 
i don't think that's a good idea for this right now, mom, really. 
<unk> right, mom. 
here you go, funeral <unk> 
you don't like that, do you, <unk> 
i meant <unk> mom. 
just a <unk> 
he's <unk>

<unk> reminds me of bob <unk> 
you know, a real <unk> 
<unk> 
good. 
here we go. 
<unk> 
we'll have to work on the <unk> 
okay. 
what you need is a little <unk> 
well, i think you're right. 
wait till you taste this. 
come on, dad. 
okay. 
hmm, okay. 
here. 
try this. 
come on, dad, take a piece.

i'll just take these and go. 
why are you here, <unk> 
why are you here, <unk> 
what? 
you know, if you're wondering about the <unk> 
where's the <unk> 
it's your <unk> dad. 
what are you talking about? 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i'm worried about her. 
well, don't worry, dad. 
<unk> i'm sure she's okay. 
you think so? 
yeah. 
help me with the 18 <unk> <unk> for <unk> 
it's got to be done now. 
look. 
what we need now is a good night's sleep. 
you always said there was a problem, <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
i mean, there's <unk> right now, dad. 
let's sit on it. 
dad? 
dad? 
dad? 
dad, where are you? 
dad? 
dad? 
dad? 
dad? 
what do you think you're doing? 
oh, dad, come on, i'll help you.

dad, you can't miss the bed. 
get out. 
come on dad, get out. 
dad, come on. 
i got you. 
<unk> 
come on. 
<unk> 
i got you, i got you. 
i got you. 
mr. <unk> 
<unk> i understand you're not going back to the hospital. 
yeah. 
i thought it would be hard to make her feel at home. 
that's no place for him right now. 
you're not gonna be home too, are you? 
maybe you should try a <unk> <unk> 
i know how kids like to wear <unk> 
you know what that means. 
i know what <unk> is. 
mr. <unk> <unk> they are human <unk> 
we can handle any <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
we live in a <unk> where old people finally grow up. 
what's your name? 
why are you <unk> 
there's another doctor in this hospital. 
i think he can do better than dr. <unk> 
what? 
i <unk> everything they said. 
he's a good man. 
i want a <unk> of his <unk> 
mr. <unk> 
mr. <unk> 
<unk> mr. <unk> 
let's do some <unk> 
let's get a <unk> and identify the <unk> 
give us the <unk> and we'll <unk> your vital <unk> 
i'm not so sure what caused it, but right now i'm in the middle of a <unk> <unk> 
the question is, what caused it? 
and why is there no <unk> 
if you want to do another <unk> do your <unk> 
no, that won't be necessary. 
well, as we say, we sit around and do nothing, say nothing. 
<unk> 
we've done a series of tests so far, and we'll do more. 
so far our only hope is to shoot <unk> <unk> 
i appreciate your <unk> doctor. 
but it's been a long time since we had this <unk> right? 
if we stay here for a while, the <unk> will be <unk> him at all times. 
and i will visit him twice a day. 
he was <unk> from the start. 
i'm afraid that's not entirely <unk> 
how long are you going to take this? 
i don't know. 
i leave once a day. 
<unk> 
i'm talking to him. 
i'm here talking to <unk> 
i think if we stay there and he <unk> he's dead. 
what about <unk> 
<unk> it's <unk> 
you're the only one who can do it, john. 
why don't you take him to the <unk> 
i should've told you that. 
maybe i should be there when he comes to his end. 
i don't know. 
to prove he was still here. 
to prove i was his son. 
so what have you done <unk> 
<unk> this man has gone out to work every day in his life. 
i never trusted him. 
he did it because he was <unk> and he had no choice. 
you never asked me if i was happy or happy. 
you never asked if he had the right. 
and when that <unk> <unk> his <unk> he <unk> and <unk> him. 
but i <unk> it. 
john. 
i couldn't resist him, but my mother <unk> him. 
he's in the <unk> 
i did it because i had a marriage that went bad, and i had a job to <unk> and i barely have a son. 
maybe it'll be too hard for me. 
but i will be there when she dies. 
and i <unk> him and <unk> him. 
...and she <unk> the gold out there at the time. 
i owe him that. 
when did you come to town? 
never been. 
i'm staying with some friends. 
i didn't want to leave <unk> 
you come here every day? 
when you're gone, a nurse is looking for me. 
i'm standing over a half an hour. 
i'm <unk> <unk> 
<unk> dad. 
i can understand that. 
why are you here? 
was there a car accident or something? 
he <unk> 
yes, he does. 
you sound like a child. 
go, uh, get this to dr. <unk> 
please, please. 
why are you being so nice to me? 
uh, <unk> one of the hospital, dad. 
<unk> a <unk> 
this is <unk> this is <unk> uh, this is <unk> 
this is my father. 
okay, mr. <unk> 
how can i leave you alone? 
let's get these <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> 
and then i think you should do something. 
you gonna starve me out here? 
okay, first we need to get some <unk> 
remember, we haven't eaten in a long time. 
maybe that's why you're here. 
you can't do that, <unk> 
all the tests are <unk> <unk> <unk> 
this is a healthy human being. 
i've seen people coming out of <unk> before. 
i don't usually know why. 
there's some <unk> on this. 
that <unk> <unk> 
like what? 
the last time we <unk> we gave him <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and he was <unk> 
i see. 
you know, when i came home, it was all <unk> 
but it was because of your <unk> and your <unk> and your <unk> and your <unk> 
i think that's better. 
me too. 
they're here. 
what's going on, dad? 
what are you looking for? 
your mother and i are starting a new life together, johnny. 
we need new <unk> 
i don't know, dad. 
what do you think my mother would say to that? 
he probably looked at me and told me i was crazy, but i <unk> 
i haven't been home in ten years, <unk> 
how about that? 
thank you. 
thank you, thank you. 
ladies, ladies, the <unk> begins. 
how often do you <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> 
<unk> <unk> number one <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and almost <unk> <unk> <unk> 
great, jake. 
i'm asking him to be a great <unk> 
come on, a big <unk> 
we're moving on. 
and his <unk> <unk> <unk> 
ladies and gentlemen, <unk> 
this is my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
maybe you should ask <unk> 
this is my <unk> <unk> 
<unk> 
i think i can do this more at home. 
actually, i was going to watch a few games but not this <unk> 
that's good to hear, jake. 
wait. 
there's another one. 
don't come back. 
oh, <unk> <unk> 
i couldn't stop them. 
<unk> 
<unk> never killed anyone in <unk> 
but wouldn't that be nice? 
i'm telling you, johnny, he's not the same. 
maybe <unk> is a <unk> 
<unk> you know what happens. 
no one's gonna believe he's a <unk> and he's about to die a few weeks ago. 
i'm meeting someone, seriously. 
mom, he's just <unk> 
the only hole is golf course, but the <unk> 
it's a wonderful day. 
after the <unk> they'll take us somewhere. 
that's a good idea. 
maybe mom will come along with us. 
his <unk> got in the car. 
you were driving too fast before. 
i hate hearing things they love. 
don't worry about your pretty little head, <unk> 
you will be safe from the old jake <unk> office. 
and this is gonna be fun. 
what are you doing down here? 
nothing. 
i still want to see if you can pull off the <unk> 
i call it <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
you coming to the <unk> 
i'm coming, but only with a taxi. 
i don't want to go to <unk> 
i think we can sail to santa <unk> 
that's where old people are. 
there's a bank or bank in every corner of every corner. 
i want to drive to <unk> 
oh, i used to love fish <unk> 
where's <unk> <unk> 
i think i put them in a place where they won't find them.
it was 35 years ago. 
i'll go get them. 
he'll be fine. 
johnny, i'm scared. 
it's either that or i'm not sure if i like people i don't know, or what i do. 
he says that he was at a <unk> <unk> in new york and now he wants us there as a <unk> 
what? 
dad. 
she told you, huh? 
what's going on? 
take me for a ride. 
john, i need to talk. 
johnny, 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> me, your mom and your mom and a little <unk> <unk> 
i don't think you have a chance, dad. 
is there no chance of a <unk> <unk> 
don't i have four kids there? 
you, <unk> hank and little <unk> 
as far as i know, dad, you've been living in los angeles for the past
you had a regular job at <unk> until you <unk> 
before that i was <unk> and i was there for <unk> 
i know you're right. 
i mean, how can you be in two places at once? 
i mean, <unk> my life is just like this 
i'm sitting on the <unk> watching <unk> 
if this is too technical or too much, let me know. 
it's a <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> 
over the years, he has <unk> enough pleasure from his daily life, and he <unk> things he <unk> 
<unk> is more <unk> than life. 
how long has this been? 
it's hard to say. 
at least 20 years, maybe more. 
incredible. 
you should know that when you do that, you have to be <unk> <unk> <unk> and emotional <unk> 
and where's my mother in all this? 
she went through all this? 
you are <unk> 
your mother is very <unk> very sweet. 
isn't that the most important thing in the world? 
he has <unk> 
the main problem is that your father is <unk> in this world where your father is. 
he's been a happy person ever since he met you. 
his two <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
and he's brought in years of his life, away from his <unk> life. 
if your mother doesn't tell him, <unk> will go to <unk> 
hello, all the beautiful people here. 
maybe i can do some <unk> on the bike road. 
what would people think if they saw you like this? 
who cares? 
i don't want people to think we're old. 
and now you know what people think. 
just ignore what a few young people see into us. 
i'm going with you, dad. 
good boy, good boy. 
don't worry about me. 
i'm gonna go down to <unk> and pick up a few things for the
hey, mom, mom, i told you what the doctor said. 
you need to help him sometime. 
this kind of <unk> doesn't change anything. 
he lives in another time <unk> 
you have to show it to him. 
that's all. 
i believe you, it's just a <unk> 
good dream and a wonderful dream. 
my father is telling me how to <unk> two world right now. 
it's called that. 
i don't care what you say. 
something happened to him. 
this man is not your father. 
i think this is the real jake <unk>

<unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
how's it going with dad? 
the doctor thinks it's <unk> 
he's trying to get into <unk> at night. 
leave me alone! 
your father was always a <unk> <unk> but new york is a <unk> <unk> 
when we first met, my friend <unk> told me about all the things we did with your father, and he told me to leave him to the police. 
when <unk> <unk> he said he would pray for me. 
but it didn't work. 
you know, when your father gets <unk> you never know what you do or say or do, you don't remember anything.

because i love the power of it. 
it's nice to be able to take care of everyone if they do the job well. 
and something <unk> which is <unk> 
well, i've never done that. 
<unk> can never go far. 
running away was the hardest thing to me. 
that's not what it says. 
i mean, because we wanted to be normal. 
that's what the <unk> says. 
<unk> <unk> 
but it <unk> 
a little. 
still <unk> 
i can't hear you, billy. 
and you never needed me around.

what happened to <unk> <unk> <unk>

this is the biggest <unk> in baseball history. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> joe <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
al <unk> <unk> 
it's just the <unk> <unk> 
carl <unk> is <unk>

everyone there knew that. 
but that little guy comes out of the <unk> 
<unk> then <unk> 
but he <unk> the ball to joe <unk> 
at the last moment, <unk> 
he lived forever. 
but it's the big thing. 
<unk> started <unk> second tour <unk> next thing she saw him throw the ball in the <unk> 
it's very <unk> <unk> <unk> 
you like that? 
the man who never <unk> his feelings is a <unk> <unk> 
take the feelings out of him, <unk> 
do you know what that means to me? 
what is it? 
if you do your job well, everything will change. 
sometimes i wish i had more fun with you when you were a kid. 
i wish i could kiss you more. 
you did this, father, you did. 
do you know how much i love you? 
yeah. 
a lot has happened, johnny. 
sometimes good, sometimes bad. 
honey, i'll put these in the car. 
okay.

yeah, me too. 
go ahead, i'll teach you. 
one moment, please. 
you start. 
<unk> 
<unk> <unk> we wanted to say goodbye to you first. 
well, and we decided this was the right place to do it. 
because there's a lot of things here. 
you have <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
what can i say about you, <unk> 
that was fun. 
yeah. 
<unk> i love you and i will always miss you. 
my father and i grew up here. 
that's good. 
that's a good idea. 
i feel better. 
me too. 
<unk> and <unk> show that <unk> <unk> and <unk> have been invited to black <unk> 
i feel like you're trying to expose me to a <unk> 
<unk> <unk> here. 
but i understand that the political <unk> that are going on this year are the same <unk> 
half the traditional <unk> <unk> and now, half of it ends up in <unk> 
tell me, <unk> is there anything else? 
please don't help their <unk> 
but the truth is, when i took care of the <unk> <unk> i was able to find a more <unk> tool that i
<unk> <unk> <unk> died of a <unk> <unk> 
the last place you brought was when you were at <unk> <unk> <unk> 
a <unk> is not only a man's <unk> but his <unk> 
this victim represents <unk> 
i <unk> myself as a military <unk> not a <unk> 
why don't you sleep with that guy at night? 
the man's sword was <unk> and now he sees himself in this beautiful <unk> 
because i have a way of <unk> people with my two hands and two good <unk> and two very comfortable <unk> <unk> 
you did a very serious <unk> tonight, <unk> 
but i'm staying in the black <unk> <unk> 
come see me before i go, <unk> 
what did he give you? 
i felt very different in the same <unk> and i got a tip that i didn't realize that. 
i will not allow you to <unk> our family in the simple way that you <unk> in order to destroy yourself and your
it depends on how much i want to deny you and how much i <unk> you. 
<unk> <unk> last week he gave me a son. 
legal <unk> 
i wonder how long it will take him to curse the <unk> 
you're a good man. 
by men who know how to fight. 
<unk> this is <unk> 
they're <unk> an <unk> today. 
she's absolutely <unk> but i'd rather go to bed with that <unk> <unk> over there. 
please give me something to drink from the memory <unk> 
depends on what's in it. 
the fact that <unk> is a weapon made by people who don't know the truth. 
after the <unk> your <unk> will also be <unk> 
you ever hear of a river called <unk> 
the so-called most <unk> is that the river is <unk> 
a man's death will open the door of his <unk> 
i saw a man executed today. 
please give me something to drink from the memory <unk> 
this is a <unk> <unk> used for a religious <unk> long before <unk> <unk> 
we are known as <unk> <unk> 
what your people call <unk> is a <unk> of what they call <unk> 
lately, some of the <unk> have been unable to locate the book. 
<unk> ben <unk> was following those <unk> when he was <unk> to death. 
maybe <unk> <unk> is hiding the secret <unk> 
someone named <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i still don't understand what this has to do with me. 
<unk> was taken against <unk> 
remember when there was an incident at the <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
we're here to get the missing <unk> 
what do i do until then? 
fate <unk> you, <unk> 
i'm <unk> <unk> 
then don't be so hard on yourself. 
so where do we start <unk> 
<unk> <unk> the spirit of the <unk> 
i already opened the door for you. 
what about <unk> 
he'll be waiting for you on the other side. 
all you have to do is walk through the door. 
<unk> 
i haven't seen you since last night. 
this is <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> was looking for you last night. 
they said <unk> <unk> wanted you himself. 
<unk> di <unk> <unk> 
they said he was <unk> bastard. 
and the problem was that you were <unk> and you were pretty sure that you <unk> your own <unk> 
<unk> means <unk> of our own. 
<unk> <unk> seems to think that <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> 
his <unk> only <unk> your <unk> 
he must be pretty careful. 
a character <unk> 
you must be smart enough to get this done. 
<unk> when you become mrs. <unk> the last thing you need is a <unk> 
then let me tell your dad that you signed a contract. 
there are some <unk> that i think you might be interested in. 
this is the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> 
when the top is <unk> the <unk> will be <unk> under his <unk> and that part will be <unk> 
<unk> is also a <unk> <unk> 
there'll be two men in the <unk> 
we can't control the <unk> so we can <unk> the <unk> 
<unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> 
it's a flight <unk> 
a <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> yeah. 
i believe in the will of the people and the lord has <unk> us by letting us know that you can imagine. 
everything you dream of has finally <unk> 
anyone who says otherwise is a <unk> 
what exactly are we talking about? 
i hope it works as an army <unk> 
i'm a <unk> too 
i had nothing to do with war <unk> 
<unk> too. 
and the two government <unk> with the other <unk> 
<unk> death was the end of the play game. 
you need your own <unk> sir. 
i'll give you a <unk> 
to see if any of this is true or not. 
shall we say 100 <unk> 
if you <unk> any more <unk> i will cut your tongue off. 
as you say, sir. 
thank you. 
<unk> you are here to <unk> me, aren't you? 
i gave up everything i could to get to <unk> 
<unk> but i would advise you not to be too smart for my <unk> 
something wrong? 
no, sir. 
<unk> no secrets. 
what kind of <unk> did you do this time? 
a woman's <unk> is <unk> 
then get back to work. 
there's a <unk> 
i want you to find <unk> <unk> body. 
i have to go. 
that's what i'm talking about. 
depends on the body. 
then i'll go to work. 
<unk> family is coming. 
with <unk> <unk> and old <unk> 
<unk> 
the first <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> about to <unk> 
<unk> welcome to god's <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> is very fond of you. 
tell me the truth, <unk> <unk> you are not going to stop being so <unk> 
you're not <unk> ma'am. 
no more of these <unk> miss <unk> 
i knew it was you the first time he hit me. 
where do we start? 
you <unk> 
facial <unk> <unk> 
the more <unk> question is, why would he risk his <unk> to <unk> a noble woman's <unk> 
isn't that what this is about? 
tell me what it is, then. 
i didn't mean to upset you. 
<unk> <unk> is so <unk> 
can i see <unk> <unk> 
what's this? 
a <unk> to <unk> one's <unk> <unk> 
and under what <unk> would you say that? 
say you're stuck in an <unk> 
if we do this, we'll have to do it in safe <unk> 
thank god. 
<unk> i can't tell you she's right. 
you risked your life. 
maybe you're right. 
and what does <unk> <unk> look like? 
i'm an illegal <unk> and i think you're <unk> too. 
this is the third party that says something to me about <unk> 
maybe you just started hearing about it. 
now... 
you <unk> me again, <unk> 
this time, remember, you're not the only one who can stop the <unk> 
we can't let you walk through the front door for certain reasons. 
what <unk> 
i promised to pay first. 
i won't accept you <unk> 
then don't start talking. 
there's a new player on stage. 
<unk> is also known as <unk> 
<unk> hired him to build <unk> weapons. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
i don't understand why this news would save us. 
these <unk> are different. 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> you're <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
looks like <unk> got himself a new <unk> 
keep watching him. 
see if he's <unk> 
and <unk> 
then <unk> will be <unk> in hell. 
with god's other <unk> 
<unk> 
yeah, you too. 
a good <unk> needs to be <unk> <unk> 
when the bad guy comes at you, <unk> <unk> a new <unk> 
until adam <unk> or you beat me? 
i didn't ask you to give me a hole in the <unk> 
i want you to meet my <unk> 
you can't do that, <unk> 
men don't always around to protect women. 
besides, what if you're the guy you should be <unk> 
could be. 
okay. 
you <unk> him against his <unk> and he <unk> his own <unk> 
<unk> <unk> a deadly gun, some <unk> some <unk> 
ready! 
okay! 
<unk> 
<unk> 
i was <unk> with young <unk> 
thanks a lot, <unk> 
we have to get out of here, <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> why don't you go and get some <unk> 
you don't want to be in that awful place again, do you? 
nobody wants that. 
<unk> 
this time i hope you stay away from <unk> 
let's go home. 
this is the second time <unk> has returned to us. 
it's our <unk> 
it means you work for <unk> which means he wasn't involved. 
good boy. 
by the way, get out. 
why don't you open your big mouth all the time, instead of <unk> your <unk> 
<unk> team is <unk> <unk> right? 
at least <unk> 
<unk> the <unk> you bought for <unk> 
i'm so proud of you. 
never hurts to be ready. 
if <unk> thinks he can help you, why not? 
i was joking. 
<unk> if you want to get to know <unk> better, maybe you have a <unk> dinner for him at our <unk> <unk> 
i mean, i... 
is it that <unk> 
i don't think anyone else noticed that. 
still, the last thing any of us should be doing is making a couple. 
office <unk> even under normal <unk> 
we live under normal circumstances. 
what are the chances that we don't have to deal with something we have to deal with out there? 
i don't know, maybe <unk> 
being a <unk> 
i actually wanted to be alone. 
<unk> tell him you like him. 
this murder happened a week ago. 
why are you telling me this now? 
how did you get these? 
the police told you that? 
they usually do when the victim was <unk> 
she said she was <unk> him. 
i was trying to get her to stop. 
it actually worked. 
look who's been <unk> 20 minutes before the crime <unk> 
what? 
okay, nice. 
and who's that? 
are you sure it's him? 
if you kill one of my <unk> i will <unk> his face. 
yes, that's him. 
now we know why the <unk> woman's death was given to me. 
he died because of me. 
if <unk> is somehow <unk> then so am i. 
<unk> 
hey. 
whatever you're doing right now, you're not responsible for this, and neither am i. 
but i know who you are. 
a little <unk> <unk> 
long day at the office. 
<unk> <unk> 
i got this. 
i know some of her powers have <unk> it. 
billy was definitely mad at me, and you believed him. 
this is the most important <unk> in the country. 
east <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> won't do anything to them. 
it's not like some <unk> <unk> 
stay away from <unk> 
i don't think <unk> will be very good either. 
how about we sneak in and pretend like we're not <unk> 
all right, you wanna go next? 
i think we should stay here. 
why didn't you call me when you asked me in? 
as far as i know, we have <unk> <unk> 
i've never loved a woman in my life. 
i just love <unk> 
<unk> 
really? 
you <unk> me. 
we're taking you in for <unk> 
<unk> read him his rights. 
who are you? 
no one. 
there is a woman in the world who doesn't give a shit about <unk> 
yeah, it's a prison <unk> with <unk> million in it. 
yes, but for how long? 
a <unk> <unk> <unk> in a demon <unk> couldn't do much, so my guess, regular <unk> not really a problem. 
<unk> what are you gonna do? 
you can't just walk into a police station, <unk> 
there's been an accident. 
we need to tell him what the woman in the <unk> did to her before she was
it's not a bad idea to come by while you're visiting the patient in the hospital. 
it's part of the blood you <unk> 
not human. 
he's headed this way. 
i'll take a sample and see what kind of <unk> billy is. 
i'll take care of a <unk> 
<unk> daily <unk> 
<unk> 
i don't think you should do this. 
how do i look? 
i managed to get blood from the <unk> 
maybe we can find out what demon <unk> and how the <unk> work. 
can you get me a glass <unk> 
thank you. 
are you going to invite me in? 
please, come in. 
i want you to call me <unk> 
<unk> tell <unk> everything. 
what makes you think i would do that? 
first of all, it was your fault. 
if you try to <unk> i know now. 
<unk> side by side. 
<unk> feels responsible for this boy because he brought her back from <unk> 
i feel responsible because he did it to save me. 
in fact, you're completely responsible for that because you're a <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> this spring isn't <unk> 
billy <unk> <unk> people. 
then why are you wearing <unk> 
others can take hours. 
god, <unk> i hope you start to feel <unk> 
you're really <unk> 
i have to find <unk> 
and why should i help you? 
do you remember the man you used to break into <unk> 
you know what he did to me? 
the shape of the <unk> <unk> <unk> is that every second of every second his <unk> ends in pain, or until he dies. 
it's about <unk> 
you certainly have something you can do to stop it. 
your life could be destroyed by someone else. 
and if a woman strong enough to make her <unk> she would never forgive her <unk> 
where's <unk> 
i understand why you did this to your <unk> <unk> 
there's a reason, right? 
how many times you want to talk to <unk> <unk> 
shall i introduce you? 
she probably left it in the back, told her how to drive. 
you know these <unk> 
probably deserved it. 
like i said... 
<unk> <unk> here. 
hi, <unk> 
billy. 
i didn't know you were having a party. 
i thought we agreed that you weren't here anymore. 
do you want to, or should i? 
some of the <unk> seem to be <unk> strong. 
these are probably from <unk> demon <unk> 
so it looks like <unk> <unk> people with <unk> <unk> 
which means it could be <unk> or <unk> or even <unk> 
<unk> where's <unk> <unk> 
when he got out of the <unk> he thought he was coming out because he was sleeping with her.
well... when i <unk> 
if you lie to me again, it'll be a serious problem. 
sit down, <unk> 
there's something we need to talk about. 
i'm sorry i didn't know you went to <unk> 
we still have to make some changes around here. 
change can be good, i guess. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> 
maybe your mom and dad never told you what he was going after grown men in <unk> 
you can't just come in here all the time and talk like that.
you can't blame me for actually taking her. 
is that what you want? 
stop it. 
now you're <unk> 
put your hair in the back, close your eyes, and then join us in the <unk> 
you think you can do anything you want because you stick to a life of <unk> 
no. 
i'll show you the blood. 
what do you say to a woman with two eyes on <unk> 
nothing you've already said twice. 
no sense of humor. 
honestly, i'm calling to kill that <unk> 
come in. 
you should know the rules about billy. 
<unk> everybody knows the rules. 
you leave your girlfriend alone with her with your <unk> and you never let her touch you. 
you want money, leave it on the table, <unk> 
can you teach me something? 
why did you invite me in after i told you i wanted to kill <unk> 
you're <unk> right? 
did billy mention me? 
he said someone named <unk> was coming here sooner or later. 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> 
i know what you did. 
who you are. 
you <unk> me. 
he <unk> me to find you. 
it's like a <unk> game. 
don't make me <unk> to girls. 
but you'll never die, will you? 
no, you stay and you keep running. 
guess what, <unk> i'm not a <unk> <unk> 
i'm a <unk> 
you showed up, didn't you? 
no, <unk> 
<unk> 
you and <unk> <unk> conspiracy <unk> 
<unk> <unk> eat this. 
it's just a <unk> 
the problem is <unk> 
why are you telling me this? 
do i know you? 
i thought you should leave. 
the burning <unk> used to <unk> you and torture you into the <unk> 
i see. 
the woman who <unk> the <unk> <unk> she needs to shoot the whole <unk> <unk> 
no, asshole. 
i'm here to arrest you. 
i mean, sure, you women sell yourselves for money and <unk> but men are just as bad as they are. 
maybe even worse. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> even <unk> for what's under your <unk> 
i don't wear pants. 
actually, i was here because i had an arrow in my <unk> <unk> 
and a <unk> <unk> 
i don't think so. 
you don't have the guts to do this. 
<unk> again. 
don't hurt me! 
no, i won't hurt her. 
i'm not gonna hurt her. 
here. 
i can tell you that <unk> blood is <unk> 
so the fingerprints downstairs are on <unk> <unk> 
and you think i'm just gonna take it in my hand and turn it into a <unk> <unk> 
it <unk> me even though i look like this. 
i'd better get out of here. 
lock the door behind me. 
maybe the plan is <unk> 
oh, god. 
you said the plan was <unk> but what's the plan <unk> 
plan <unk> 
plan <unk> 
the plan is to kill you if you don't stop <unk> 
oh, god. 
<unk> get out of here. 
to get to the <unk> all the <unk> all the <unk> 
please go. 
i can't. 
this is my <unk> 
you think that's your problem? 
you know what your real problem is? 
<unk> like that. 
because your power <unk> me. 
charles, you scared me. 
take this and put me down. 
you want me to believe you? 
yes! 
i can't. 
<unk> 
hit me! 
charles, please. 
<unk> <unk> fine. 
you can't do this. 
do you want to hear my <unk> <unk> 
about how stupid you are. 
after five years of <unk> i believe that to be safe, we went out to the dark little <unk> to be safe. 
let's finish this. 
i'm sorry, <unk> 
you're sorry? 
you were right about how i liked dark places for <unk> 
but you forgot that i also love <unk> <unk> 
i don't understand. 
i mean, you're a <unk> but why don't you get out of the <unk> 
maybe it's because i'm not human. 
and a vampire can never be <unk> 
you know that thing about <unk> <unk> 
it was always about pain and <unk> 
i think evil <unk> makes you less of a <unk> than people. 
like a noble one. 
i mean, being a <unk> is really <unk> 
strange. 
what is it? 
i was out <unk> <unk> and i was also a <unk> 
i understand that. 
<unk> it's me, <unk> 
does it hurt? 
i left you a lot of messages. 
i'm so sorry. 
<unk> get back to work! 
how do i look? 
but it's time to go back. 
<unk> 
something <unk> from the surface to surface. 
god, no. 
it wasn't something in there, <unk> 
it was something that was done to you. 
i don't know what kind of man i am anymore. 
i know. 
you're a good man. 
will i see you in the office again? 
yeah. 
good. 
why risk everything to escape the <unk> <unk> 
tomorrow we return to rome. 
but i want you to go to <unk> 
a <unk> <unk> 
<unk> get over here! 
her name is <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> and <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i thought <unk> <unk> was the <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> their <unk> 
let me know if <unk> <unk> 
then we must support the <unk> and wait for the <unk> to see the days of the <unk> 
was <unk> always like <unk> 
the days after the <unk> were <unk> 
<unk> blood was <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
to show the end of <unk> <unk> 
<unk> is out of her mind, trying to <unk> you. 
if i had only <unk> my own <unk> perhaps i would have <unk> 
<unk> was headed towards <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
he was a whore by the name of <unk> and <unk> <unk> until he was <unk> 
this offer has made me quite <unk> 
i don't know which one of you is <unk> by the <unk> 
there was this kind of <unk> why would she choose <unk> 
we can't afford to go to <unk> <unk> 
and to say hello to an <unk> <unk> <unk> 
you can't possibly think of taking that offer. 
<unk> wants to know what you know about <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> 
and when the time comes, we will take revenge for those who are <unk> 
we still keep our <unk> warm <unk> to ourselves. 
and to <unk> the <unk> of death is <unk> 
every drop of blood is <unk> to the <unk> of our <unk> 
i have professor charles <unk> with me a <unk> who <unk> <unk> for the fbi. 
are you here to help me find <unk> <unk> 
we know that miss <unk> car was <unk> in san francisco. 
yeah, the reason i went after him for revenge is because of <unk> and <unk> 
yeah, that's right, but each suspect is <unk> <unk> 
you know that <unk> game where they put <unk> in the mouth of <unk> <unk> 
<unk> threat <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> each <unk> just like a <unk> game <unk> into the mouth of the <unk> 
we need to find the situation where <unk> <unk> is until we get to the point. 
if <unk> had taken advantage of him, he would have <unk> his eye. 
<unk> <unk> been making a lot of noise lately. 
hello, charlie. 
your father <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> the other day. 
long story short, do your <unk> a favor. 
it was a closed <unk> during the <unk> 
you can't work on your own until you do. 
<unk> <unk> in the same room. 
<unk> <unk> 
i'll go by myself. 
the <unk> team has <unk> the <unk> we found in her office. 
<unk> old <unk> angry <unk> 
yeah, i'm on my way to <unk> right now. 
charlie, who would have tried to do this to you? 
because you're already very upset about your <unk> 
it doesn't change anything. 
<unk> <unk> 
can we discuss this in the room, not here? 
<unk> it's for you. 
you and mom are so excited to see something big happen to her. 
i started out as soon as i started this. 
a central <unk> in the <unk> area makes the <unk> look like a great hero. 
in the name of <unk> the <unk> began to <unk> and began to talk about <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i'm still working on it. 
that's the problem as well as i <unk> what i <unk> and what i <unk> 
i told your dad i'd make a shot. 
so how long does it take to see the electrical <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
it is, isn't it? 
i don't know how much longer i can stand it. 
you either work too hard, or you're too small. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
when i find the <unk> he'll signal the <unk> 
there's no way he's gonna find him on his own. 
when i was in that <unk> <unk> there was something that made me believe in the <unk> <unk> 
he knew <unk> would come for me. 
no matter how bad things are, david, you and don <unk> and don <unk> and <unk> are gonna walk through that door. 
because i was going to do the same thing the first time i saw <unk> 
yeah, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of it. 
a certain <unk> force <unk> down the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> them down with a power <unk> 
it also helps <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> 
all the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the water. 
you can use it to buy that <unk> 
<unk> probably. 
<unk> 
so is this. 
it's nothing but a personal <unk> 
it's not just <unk> and <unk> 
and all that master <unk> spirit is the same as beauty and <unk> 
<unk> 
i mean, do you think i'm a <unk> to you? 
you know, i feel better. 
what do you do exactly? 
nobody loves <unk> 
we've lost contact with the <unk> <unk> 
but we do know that the <unk> of the disease is based on the <unk> point of this <unk> 
you can't do that without a <unk> 
you will go in with special <unk> find any <unk> and get a blood sample from the <unk> <unk> and <unk> it before it <unk> the entire area at <unk> 
i don't need to tell you what happens when you get 60 <unk> of <unk> 
what's that smell?

you can kill the others or you can at least try.

it's just the right time, the right reason and the right place.

you <unk> me, <unk> 
run, <unk> run. 
go ahead. 
what do you want? 
you don't have to sue me for that. 
i've never seen this case before the trial.

i managed to keep him on the <unk> but he's probably <unk> 
<unk> 
oh, <unk> 
<unk> 
what happened to him, <unk> 
<unk> 
what did you tell him? 
do it now. 
be <unk> enough to do it. 
i know you'll leave me. 
because it's <unk> 
because you don't want to be with someone as fat as i am. 
because you always hated fat people. 
so i want you to listen to me now. 
don't touch me. 
stop. 
<unk> 
she hasn't left the house in five months. 
all i do is work and <unk> 
no <unk> without <unk> 
i can't do anything without him. 
you can't spend your whole life with a man. 
i had no experience <unk> things differently. 
i feel like i've been living the rest of my life for 12 years.
because i wanted him to leave me. 
dump me, dump me, dump me! 
<unk> <unk> and my partner came to see me. 
suddenly i heard a <unk> and there was a man fighting with <unk> 
i thought i could stop him. 
i <unk> him and <unk> him. 
i tried to get help, but obviously, my heart was <unk> 
did you see the man who shot him? 
no. 
very <unk> 
was anyone having trouble with <unk> 
no. 
last question. 
you're that <unk> guy, right? 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> 
<unk> 
<unk> 
look at you, please. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of society.

<unk> yourself with a <unk> 
<unk> 
<unk>

let's see if the <unk> connected to <unk> 
12 <unk> of <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
looks like <unk> was the only one connected to <unk> <unk> 
why do you think you lost <unk> 
i don't know, i haven't been back in the last few months. 
there's a <unk> and a <unk> 
but i think it's actually more <unk> <unk> 
much more. 
it's good for your heart to feel a little cold. 
<unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> 
we have to stick together in this life. 
take off your clothes, <unk> 
he likes seeing them <unk> 
<unk> 
i'll be right back. 
what's this? 
i checked all the <unk> myself. 
i can't believe it either.

one less of you, <unk> 
asshole. 
a single <unk> is <unk> 
this <unk> must really love you.

you should be ashamed of yourself. 
how many <unk> women have you seen who look better than this? 
<unk> 
they all think how awesome <unk> is. 
that's not what i expected. 
you can't go on like this. 
it's <unk> 
i know. 
did you invite anyone? 
put something on. 
i told my parents i wanted to take private lessons from you. 
i can't stand being at home or school.

take off your clothes. 
how's the new <unk> <unk>

they <unk> us, <unk> 
but i'm just a <unk> like i did. 
they keep it under hand to keep the blood <unk> out. 
so you can get blood <unk> 
give me that. 
open the book.

you think that's true? 
did you tell the other girls about my <unk> 
<unk> right? 
i don't think it's funny. 
because i'm not well. 
all i can think about is having sex with you. 
over and over again. 
i see <unk> like this and... 
by the way, he didn't come home. 
do you have other <unk> 
sex <unk> 
no, the love <unk> 
<unk> 
i'm ready to be <unk> 
i'm scared of being apart.

<unk> 
the doctor said i was good enough to live with my normal life. 
what's wrong? 
<unk> <unk> 
merry christmas, <unk>

besides, we were married before the <unk> <unk>

until <unk> gave me a sex <unk>

<unk> <unk> 
you're gonna enjoy this trip as much as i enjoyed it. 
what about him? 
did you do something to her?

like what he did to you. 
no, <unk> 
one question, mr. <unk> 
it's a little hard for you to talk to your personal <unk> isn't it? 
a beer can bring out things that don't <unk> itself. 
like your <unk> <unk> 
<unk> sister really <unk> me. 
he's always talking about happy and <unk> and another cake and another <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
i think i just saw <unk> leave. 
i swear it was him.

what happened to <unk> <unk> 
i don't know. 
one day the wrong group came. 
sorry, i think i got the wrong time. 
it's not the wrong time, it's the wrong day. 
and he never came back. 
i called and he didn't answer. 
then he sent a message saying he was <unk> 
potato <unk> <unk> 
take one. 
what was our deal? 
i recommend a <unk> <unk> 
if he <unk> i get them. 
i feel guilty when i'm alone. 
you said we should introduce ourselves. 
<unk> is one thing, <unk> others is another. 
give me the damn <unk> 
no more guilt. 
feel better? 
much better. 
how long are you gonna be in <unk> 
all i get is a cold pizza with a <unk> 
<unk> i want you to go out of <unk> and save yourself whatever i want. 
i don't want to hear this anymore, okay? 
well, your <unk> ready. 
yes, it is. 
what's this? 
school <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> 
i'm not going to the party or to the party. 
<unk> not going? 
i don't think so. 
<unk> looks fine. 
come on, like dad said. 
one for you, one for me and everybody else. 
okay. 
you're right, he just took the <unk> kid from me. 
cute little <unk> 
"what do you like her <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> 
great. 
i left her a piece of <unk> 
no <unk> no deal. 
i'll take two <unk> and a <unk> 
no sugar in the <unk> 
okay, okay. 
take the big one, not the little one. 
are you <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
i never liked him. 
he's a spanish <unk> and he's a good <unk> 
he's going to sing us a religious song from <unk> 
okay? 
come on, <unk> 
my friend wrote the song, <unk> 
so she married me. 
what <unk> 
i can't imagine the <unk> in this <unk> 
no, <unk> is a <unk> <unk> 
<unk> can make nice <unk> music. 
if i let you play ball game, i can play this music. 
like <unk> 
<unk> 
okay, <unk> 
are you sure you don't want to close your eyes and let go of yourself?
no, it wouldn't be <unk> if i was <unk> 
goodbye then. 
can i have another beer? 
you killed your boyfriend. 
he's not my boyfriend, <unk> 
he told me to work for you. 
i just talked to him, and he said you're great. 
i hate <unk> 
<unk> up, <unk> 
come on! 
i hate <unk> too. 
hi. 
<unk> what are you doing here? 
it's not working without you. 
you don't belong here. 
why? 
i can't help you, fool. 
there are less <unk> 
don't pay. 
why would i pay for sex? 
you can't have someone who really loves you. 
i don't want to love anyone, understand? 
to find the right person. 
i'm not the right person for anyone, <unk> 
come on. 
<unk> i'm <unk> okay? 
i like men, don't you understand? 
go away! 
go! 
why? 
i can't hear you. 
when you came home late, you looked like a <unk> <unk> and you kissed me again. 
yeah, i remember. 
i met <unk> today. 
you know, normal life. 
okay. 
i have something to do tomorrow. 
<unk> i'll be right in. 
you want <unk> 
i want you to go to bed with me. 
and i'm telling you i'm gonna clean up first. 
<unk> 
isn't <unk> helping you deal with your brother? 
<unk> only think of themselves and perfect <unk> 
all they do is <unk> all day. 
<unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
i found a <unk> in <unk> <unk> 
<unk> if you don't like the <unk> <unk> 
all kinds of <unk> are <unk> 
come on, pick it up. 
a <unk> 
come on. 
and me. 
good, isn't it? 
even when i was a kid, i felt different. 
<unk> football <unk> or something like that. 
because if you're fat and <unk> no one can explain why you're dressed like the others. 
no one can <unk> that i'm gay. 
but i did not give in to this <unk> until my private <unk> 
i'm not allowed to <unk> <unk> 
and they gave me a <unk> 
there was this incredibly handsome <unk> who <unk> me to keep him safe from being <unk> without any <unk> 
i don't know if <unk> would have made me <unk> so he could take <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> or get a <unk> 
first <unk> one <unk> 
i'm tired of being gay. 
really. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
and that's not me. 
i was up all night looking for <unk> 
go. 
you have to pay me anyway. 
i'm a <unk> 
the worst <unk> of all time. 
<unk> a bad, <unk> <unk> 
i'm a <unk> 
it doesn't have to be bad. 
always with something ready to be <unk> 
that's why it's better to see us if we get rid of them and find out where they're taking us. 
because most of them are the <unk> of the answers we're looking for. 
put your hands on the <unk> 
close your eyes. 
let's all breathe together. 
<unk> <unk> 
breathe, breathe. 
i thought the problem was <unk> but it's <unk> 
we all have <unk> 
<unk> is the first step we need to <unk> or <unk> anything we want. 
i don't know about you, but i don't believe in <unk>
i did it on purpose. 
i'm <unk> 
<unk> but <unk> 
<unk> but i don't blame you. 
i warned you, but you didn't. 
i warned you, but you didn't. 
excuse me, but what's your love? 
are you <unk> because you want to, or because you want to keep pretending everything's <unk> 
society wants you to be fat. 
if they do, everyone will feel better, because they are <unk> 
not anymore. 
it's time to take the first step. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
one move, <unk> 
but one day of <unk> isn't enough. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> will provide the support of a long and <unk> <unk> 
believe me, there's only one way to find out. 
step three. 
<unk> pure and clear. 
<unk> pounds. 
dark brown almost <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
once again, <unk> <unk> <unk> 
should we find ourselves a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> a bird living in the <unk> 
i don't like big <unk> 
let's see. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
not exactly <unk> but <unk> 
you could be a <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
after the <unk> it's not weird. 
don't worry, <unk> 
it's gonna be okay. 
just watch your mouth. 
you were always with that girl.

nothing. 
what are you doing, <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> body <unk> <unk> 
<unk> set a sample for <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
years ago this <unk> was <unk> for weeks.

so half the <unk> is mine. 
we're <unk> <unk> so the last four <unk> these and <unk> <unk> 
i wasn't <unk> 
i even had a very nice boyfriend. 
the thing is, it wasn't <unk> 
i tried to get him into the <unk> but he wasn't in the mood for <unk> 
i mean, you don't want to stay in <unk> until <unk> 
<unk> <unk> and left me. 
i was going to go to <unk> but then alex <unk> 
honestly, alex was always there. 
two <unk> fried <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>

we decided to stay friends. 
and we were together on that point. 
one typical goodbye <unk> 
i wasn't fat. 
nice and <unk> 
light and <unk> 
the <unk> are on. 
maybe <unk> wasn't a good idea. 
we decided to be together. 
every night, <unk> and <unk> came back. 
he wasn't there to <unk> me. 
i felt so <unk> i came on the wrong day. 
sorry, i think i got the wrong time. 
it's not the time, it's wrong. 
i came to the bar. 
we have to go home. 
suddenly i realized a man was staring at me. 
i thought it was amazing how fat i thought she was and i wanted to get married. 
i asked for the <unk> <unk> but he said he paid for his <unk> 
i don't know how it happened, the guy was standing next to me.
<unk> instead of coffee. 
he kept saying how pretty i was and he wasn't bad. 
and then i remembered what i was thinking about trying something new and i was talking to other men, and i felt <unk> 
that's how i met the second guy i ever <unk> 
what can i say?
