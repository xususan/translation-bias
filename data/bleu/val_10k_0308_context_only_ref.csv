a monkey could make it.

as it's been said identical twins share dna, but they're different people.
it does go to their individuality.

they might cross a pit bull with mike tyson.
but the truth is every time science is advanced, it raises concerns over the future of humanity.
my client knows the wishes and dreams of his wife.
the question can't be who owns her dna, can it?
his kids might get to play in a sandbox with the twin of their great-grandmother.
celebrities might start selling off their dna.

how old do you think these kids are?
none of them look older than 21, 22.
so they might have been recruited from some college math department like those m.i.t. guys back in the' 90s.
and you're just gonna let that go'cause she wouldn't sleep with you.
he was my high school math teacher.
but before any one of these kids leaves, danny has to get their picture and information.

he cares about other people.
looks like it.
all of a sudden, i want to make a connection, and i don't have the first clue how to do it.
sometimes it's a real pleasure to work for you.

hey, tuck, you wanna try some pop-ups while i get them settled?
i was going to talk to you myself, but bonnie said she'd handle it.

maybe it'd be a good thing if you took over for a while.
i'd hate for anyone to have to cancel their plans.
the dentist said he could see me right now.
it's the bathroom key.
but if mom asks, they had to put me under for a root canal.

a room full of trophies and nobody to share them with?
danny seems to have it figured out.
never really tried it before.
beat it.
hey, i know my boy's work when i see it.
i believe it's called the wheeler.
we'll use you to monitor it from the inside.
patty, i saw the guy who did it.
we must have chased him out before he had time to steal anything.
she always wore it.
no, but... it looks like he's lying about everything.
whatever you've dragged your company into, it better not involve anything other than retrieving stolen documents.
daniel purcell is a brilliant man, but when he faced patty, he collapsed.
i don't know who killed your wife, but you are gonna get blamed for it.
i didn't know if we had to do it again.

best we, uh, kill them and take their product.
it is a long story, all right?
it should be right up here.
i got it back at the shop when you were on the phone.
can we call it even?
we can hardly call it a victory.
it is a long story, all right?
why'd you do that?
that's wholesale.
they use echolocation, a kind of sonar, to find their prey.
if these little fish stay close to the coral the sharks won't be able to get at them.
and he's got to try and get the boat ahead of the whale, but not in front of it.

when mia went on exchange, we wrote up a pros-and-cons list and it helped clarify our feelings.

""" it'll be so fun! """
it's on, princess!
she's dead.
i didn't realise it required a response.
of course it did.
look, if you want to know the truth, i was embarrassed by it.
and then you go and write all that stuff and send it to everyone?
it doesn't have their pictures or their id numbers.
you got it.
all these kids out of business school think they're worth $ 100,000 after one week on the job.

he's a shady character.
she's okay, but it's pretty serious.
a guy in the math department told me about it.
they make those heat sensors for cryogenic capsules.
she won't admit she's actually had a heart attack.
she's lying there going into cardiac arrest, she's claiming it's indigestion.
it felt more like gas pains to me.
because i don't think he was a real doctor.
uh, just put them right there.
i'll put them in your old bedroom.
mario said he took it pretty hard.
i didn't want to push it.
mom has a schedule and their life is essentially one long routine.

i was afraid i couldn't pass it.
johnny, a good driver knows when he's not a good driver anymore, that's all.
i mean, mom's okay, but they really like to, uh, limit the number of visitors.

it loses money every day it's open but the property it's on is worth at least $ 50 million.
and getting it off your books?
i think we can turn it.
now our cash flow projections for the division may look aggressive but we're comfortable with them.
i didn't know you knew about stuff like that.
we're just gonna buy the company and then close it down.
that's your job?
you buy companies, then close them down?
the cannery itself is sitting on prime waterfront land.
so we buy the company, close it down, then we sell off the subsidiary business, then we sell the land.
it's against the law.
i bet the girls are falling all over themselves.
good thing they didn't have it when i was in school.
he was a physical education major.
you'd read them, we'd go back, get out another four books.

she said i should use my best judgment.
we haven't talked about it up until now, and i think i know what i want.
i wouldn't be surprised at all if it were just a cyst.
what is it?
it's just something to relax you.
what time is it?
you know, john, i see men now, they hug.
i love you, too, dad.
it's beyond anything rational.
their children tend to underestimate them.
jake, it's me!
they often go into delayed shock even after minor surgery.
it comes and goes.

it seems to me that he's been very thorough and professional in your father's case.
he has to balance the will of the family members with the patient's right to know.
i don't believe it.
he's crying nonstop.
you can pick him up anytime after 12 : 00.
you can't handle him in this condition.
i think i can do it.
it was a slip of the tongue.
this kid gooden is fabulous, isn't he?
he kind of reminds me of bob gibson.
""" let's sleep on it. """
it's very hard, i realize for children to understand that their parents have gotten old.
i think he might be better than dr. santana.
i'd like to see if i can get him to take a look at your father.
annie, that man got up every day of his life and went to a job he didn't like.
we didn't ask him to.
but rather, it was your love and caring that called your father back from where he'd gone.
she'll probably laugh and call me crazy, but she'll laugh.
ah, it's a good idea.
and it's almost as much fun.
over the years, he hasn't been getting enough pleasure out of his daily life, so he's isolated his greatest joys into a dream.
is she just shut out?
the problem is your father's participation in this world is totally tied up with your mother's approval.
what will people think if they see you like this?
it's very important that you support him right now.
i think it should be pointed out to him.
he's trying.
the doctor thinks he's making a lot of progress.
he keeps coming into my bed at night.
your father's always been a highly sexed man, but since he came back from new jersey, it's insane.
when we first got married and i told my friend fanny hogan the things we were doing, she told me to leave him and notify the police.
you know, when your father gets excited, police, priests, prayers, nothing is gonna stop him.
he's just trying to enjoy himself!
as a matter of fact, he's very impressed he didn't go insane just hanging around you for 30 years!
he wants his life back.
you look at me or people look at me and they see this old man.
it's not good.
i like it there.
it's a real family.
because i liked the power of it.
and something had to give and it was my family.
it didn't seem like it.
well, that's because we tried to make it look normal.
i don't want to miss him.
tell it to me.
hit a smash, deep left field, had home run written all over it.
everyone in the stands knew it.
he's racing after the ball.
and he doesn't realize it was hit by joe dimaggio.
this man who never showed any emotion, he was human after all.
um, and this seemed like the right place to do it.
the last corpse was decomposing by the time i took a scalpel to it.
cos your man's grip was too loose and now he finds himself staring down this handsome spada da filo.

well, with this commission, you'd be wise to overcome it.
when it comes to miss donati, boredom is the last thing i fear.
they operate cranks, which rotate the wheels.
he would have been born with wings, yes.
i believe man will fly and i base this assumption on the fact that god has blessed us with minds that are capable of imagining it.
oh, he played on a woman's vanity.
the jew that was hanged, i want you to unearth his body.
i need to examine it.
i knew it was you from the moment you approached me.
get on with it, then.
it would appear the turk has found a new champion.
continue watching him.
force the other guy to counter, and he'll open himself up.
why would they show this to me now?
well, it worked.
maybe she can tell us what billy did to her partner before he snapped.
the blood in that car, some of it is his.
angel feels responsible for this guy because he brought him back from hell.
i feel responsible because he did it to save me.
some lose their mind in an instant.
i was cut, torn up, my face disfigured and burning with pain not knowing if it would end or just get worse till i died.
"and no woman strong enough to wear the mantle of "" vicious bitch "" would ever put up with it."
hacking 1 4 years, i understand why he did it.
so however billy's putting the mojo on people, the power's in his blood.
which means it could also be in his sweat, his saliva or even his touch.
maybe mommy and daddy never explained to you that men, grown men are wired a certain way.
he wants money, leave it on a table.
"it's just an apple. """
poor, helpless, battered woman needs to vent her feelings about the injustice of it all.

well, if it's happened, it's happened in san francisco.
cops don't give up evidence like they used to.
i don't get it.

she has allergies and a special diet.
i hit her with a hairbrush until it broke.
well, we both are... very strong-willed, you see.
then whose is it?
i can't wait when mommy gets home so i can show her.
yes, i am sure she will be thrilled.
i'm sure she'll turn up in no time.
i agree, but this isn't it.
don't think like that.

my folks only care about themselves and their perfect marriage.
all they do is fuck all day long.
you were going to anyway.

trying to put on his wedding ring, but it doesn't fit.
i don't get it.
it may seem obvious, but it's trickier than you might think.
my body came around and stopped rejecting the things it didn't like.
it's all a lie.
it's all that jerk alex's fault.
i was trying to figure out my contradictions, to face up to them.
i liked it better when you paid no attention to us and went around saying :

they found us a few hours ago.
they've already taken up too much of our lives.
they hunt prey few other cheetahs would dare to tackle.
they were not close enough to take over the attack.
and all three cheetahs are onto it.
their only assets are cloven hooves that spread under load, astonishing balance... and the most uncanny agility.
finally, the fox gives it up as a bad job,
the incredible agility of the stoat, practised since it was a kit, was just enough to swing the balance.
but they're leaping out of the frying pan and into the fire.
they've come here to fatten up for the winter.
normally, it is only she who breeds.
but if she is to raise them all in this barren land, she will need the help of the entire pack.
but unfortunately, that means it soon runs out of breath.
rattlesnakes sense prey by the heat they give off, and the squirrel is able to take advantage of this.
they stay close to the shore, safe in the shallows of their nursery pool.
and with her calf, she slowly moves towards it.
the life team had set themselves a tough challenge... in trying to film exceptional hunting sequences.
part of me is elated that i've got it, but part of me is sort of sad, really,'cause i've watched these little characters, these pups... grow in the last few weeks,
it'll be a whole year before this exceptional female... returns here to hunt again.
this girl was passing by it at night last week,

it isn't an easy decision for a girl to be a cop.
then again, it's not something to brag about.
i don't even know him!
you know how it works.
but he took it personally.
i don't get it.
he did?
he was there for her when her dad died.
a rumor had it... she might've killed herself.
she thought she was with this friend... who actually was home that night.
it earned me a doctorate.
send him in.
doesn't it smell?

when he leans back, you lean forward.
shakespeare is not renowned for his brevity.
it won't harm you.
i'll take you through it.
i hope mr. churchill has better men in his cabinet.
sir, you will have no storm without him.
sir was wondering whether he could ask of you a favour.
he can ask.
i've read it.
norman, how does it begin?
men should be what they seem.
i shouldn't take it so personally.
and tonight one could say without fear of contradiction, you were at it.
i have nothing but compassion for them.
you are the only one who really, truly loves me.
i remember it well.
it's no laughing matter.
take my sword, give it the captain.

it splits off into old whisper 23.
gabe, if tower prep is a bad place, and my family helped build it- -

my love, take care of your voice, as if it is a treasure.
i've seen him... talking to himself.
if the boy got the voice... and succeeds in transmitting it... it will counteract the machine's power.
he's with ana.
you have to repair it.
you know, those reunion shows, they're so lame, really.
they never work.
you think it's a tick bite or something?

the perp was in signe's apartment, but he cleaned up after himself.
it bled a lot though.
he breaks them down to show them who's in control.

franco, sutton said case the joint, man, not rob it.
when are they gonna hit it?
and the suttons use a crew to case houses, but they do the actual rip.
they came here a year ago, been jacking wealthy houses about once a month.
m.o. is they bust in, make demands, get the money or jewelry, and then pop' em.
alex and i will set up shop in a house, wait for the suttons to break in, then we bust their asses.

even the headquarters questioned her as a proper candidate.
she could bring us medals.

give me the stromba, my mum will do it for me.
they don't care if you do it or someone else does.
they're so secretive about it.
it takes longer than i thought.
she trains a lot.
i haven't talked to her about it yet.

and if they aren't, if you and i are right, if something happened and hornigold's cavalry weren't in time to stop it, then in addition to everything else, we will be at war with spain.
if the governor's caravan was attacked, it means someone knew where to find it.

if the parthenays prove as meaningful as they might, their visit, their loyalty, could encourage compliance in the south.
it's my job, to ensure it's you who catches the king's eye.
arresting him will end your plan before it starts.

ungrateful bastards, all of them.

it's just a little thing called.
i think it's the twelfth.
i won't go into it, but i can tell you your timing was perfect.
but i won nationals a few months later, so i was glad he did.
i didn't think you were gonna make it.
it helps if you're a soloist in a company.
switchblades are spring-loaded, which makes them illegal.
it needs a kiss in there somewhere.
you can see the trainers performing what's called a thompson test, so it's probably her achilles, right?
i'd chop it off first.
well, if you're gonna slap a label on it, it's called being bi.
it was a really horrible thing to do, but i didn't do it to hurt you.
honey, a man turns his wife gay.
i didn't pick it.
enjoy it.
he came running past me and knocked me cold.
this girl, maddie, does she have a boyfriend?
he hit me like a truck.
anything else is not gonna cut it.
mayor's on television talkin' about it.
it's an embarrassment.
that's what playing is.
put a federal agent in jail to maintain his cover?
it was their raid.
we find the agent, see what he's got going.
this costs one dollar to make... and some fool will pay hundreds for it.
it's amazing how easy it is for some people... to overestimate worth.
father can't visit his son?
let's hear it.
killing him then will come with thanks... instead of retribution.
that girl worked in their brothel, then tried to run.
they left her as a message to the others.
i lost him as soon as i got inside.
you think when an asian chick sees your pecker... she's going to think it's mount st. helens.
i took him to the hospital.
it's the only thing keeping me... from ripping' this fuckin precinct to the ground.
assholes were in such a hurry to get moving... they didn't check the bodies for wires.
a court would never admit it without the agent backing it up.
and if i can't have uncle benny, then i'm gonna fuckin' have him.
it's part of the job.
it doesn't mean anything.
punch one-one after your number so i know it's you.
and i'm forbidden to them by politicians.
there will be men waiting to pay a woman for her favors.
a malaysian runs it.
they deal to children.
you wanted to know if it was the fukes... that killed that agent or if it was henry lee.
then i'm not paying for it.
he made it clear.
his old man went crooked out of the two-five.
check on him, too.
his time is over.
it's not your fault.
i know this might sound crazy, but i'm glad it's not just me.
i told him to stop.
do it right, i'll back you on trying to tip me before a hit.
but even a great man can outlast his time.
i wish it was neither of us... but the fact is, i'm glad it's not just me.
i got it.
i checked it out... and the fuck is making a case against you.
exactly what it says.
you can forget it, man.
susan got an offer she couldn't afford to refuse.
i wanna get it cleanedbefore the ceremony.
we're on the same page now, so we shouldjust focus on that.
your car would be safe in our lot, and you can pick it up tomorrow.
your kids--they have any allergies i should know about?
it was not that long agothat she keeled over in her front yard.
it's only for a few hours.
it's a thin door.
aren't they fun?
it's like the new saturday.
it'll perk you right up.
for god sakes, it was an honest mistake.
i mean, it didn't have, like, a big head or anything, did it?
well, think about it, gaby.
and the only reason you careabout my mother is because of that ridiculous suggestion she offered.
i think her offer to be our surrogate was very generous.
it wouldn't have doneany good.
it's their specialty.
well, karl is a lawyer, and it could just be a prenupfor another client.
when you put itin your mouth and eat it.
but i-i just think that gaby will never let it happen.
and i think that if you wentto her and asked her about it, then the two of youcould finally get past it.
but it was gabrielawho seduced him.
but when alejandro left, i knew exactly why it happened.
gabriela made himfall in love with her.
oh, it took me so many yearsto forgive her.
i didn't know thatyou loved her like that.
it's not like i still havefeelings for you anymore.
oh, truthfully, i haven't beenable to get my mind off it.
they're escape artists.
lynette, if i close my eyeseven for a moment, it's because of theseantihistamines i've been taking.
you put my kids in danger, and then you lied about it.
they're incorrigiblebecause you let them run amok.
oh, so you're okay with her having sex as long as it's lesbian sex.
my grandpa sneezed once and now he looks like the letter n.
"was it the chess, ed, or was it the running away after you called them "" local negroes ""?"
they call it the united negro college fund.
i think it'll totally help you.
perhaps you've heard of it.
i'm asking you to help me dig up some dirt so we can ruin him.
what kind of a lowlife has sex and doesn't pay for it?
my mom's body was a lot like mine, so i like to show it off in her memory.
but i was actually asking everybody to tell a story from their childhood.
this guy promises women grant money for sex and then never gives them the grant.
there's this sketchy guy who's tricking women into having sex... no, it's not me.
"whenever i'm walking around with the other scientists in my white lab coat, they're all, "" this scientist is bad at science. """
i couldn't have said it better myself.
and then i'm going to fold it with one hand.
wait, this has your name on it.
and it says.
i forgot how good it is.
but don't tell me if it's true or not.
you have something these women want, they have something you want.
she was always heading in the direction of self-by-self-centered.
in islam, man doesn't touch woman... who's not their wife.
it's a lifestyle magazine.
someone will pay a ransom for them.
please, don't throw it!
don't throw it!
i heard they're still searching the sea.
what do they want?
we have rooms for them.
we need it!
general, abu saiyed... and his men are upstairs.
then wave it while you walk out!
the muslim nurses will take care of them!
somebody help my husband... he's been hit!
get my bag, there's money in it.
jean and lolit have fulfilled their promise.
they paid the ransom for jessica and george.
send your armies into the mountains... and we'll see if they ever come out alive!
do you think the government will take it seriously now?
but your parents must have sold everything they have to pay your ransom.
and you say they haven't done anything bad to you.
she died a few months ago already.
i'd like to tell my children that i... that i'm thinking of them.
i'm a little unclear on that myself, but i'm willing to go along with it.
last night was about two people ruled by very powerful superegos, tortured by them, who found a chance, however misguided, to break through and rediscover their ids together.
it represents the duality of night and day, delivered to me in a vision by the astral spirits.
kalon has been my salvation from grief, as he has for everyone here.
kalon is a great man, but he's still a man.
yes, i sent those girls away, but i did it before he could be tempted.
they wanted him.
then tell me, what sort of a man covets another woman on the day of his wife's murder?
i'll put the kettle on and you can tell me all about it.
the blood on the door of the bathroom was when you tried to make it look like an accident.
i saw plenty of those when i was a chaplain in the army, but i never put it together until now.
so we let kamali have his daughter back, and he gives us the diamonds.
yeah, but he's scottish.
the problem i'm having is that nobody recognized it till it was too late, man.
if anyone has a chance to grab leatherby, we use him to get intel on the abboud woman.
she's here.
at maximum warp, it will take us three hours, 25 minutes.
they believe that a man who was once captured and assimilated by the borg should not be put in a situation where he would face them again.
it's the enterprise.
it has sustained heavy damage to its outer hull.
they're standing by.
then the missile complex must be where zefram cochrane is building his warp ship.
i must've seen this ship hundreds of times in the smithsonian, but i was never able to touch it.
this flight, it was his dream.
somehow they transported over here without being detected.
it is highly unlikely the borg will be able to break it.
who told him he could turn off my music?
now, if we tell him the truth, do you think he'll be able to handle it?
well, you better find a way to make it easy, soldier, or i'm gonna start pushing buttons.
doctor, tomorrow morning, when they detect the warp signature from your ship and realize that humans have discovered how to travel faster than light, they decide to alter their course.
it unites humanity in a way that no one ever thought possible when they realize they're not alone in the universe.
but unless you make that warp flight tomorrow morning before 1 1 : 1 5, none of it will happen.
it's a long way down.
it would appear you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endoskeletal structure.
but if it's earth you're talking about, i try to get back whenever i can.
without them, even a holographic bullet can kill.
tell me if i got it right.
well, it looks like you got it right.
i remember it made me sick to my stomach.
they've adapted.
don't tell me it's all thanks to me.
and now we're sitting in it.
if we can get off this ship and then blow it up, let's do it!
they're probably accustomed to your orders making sense.
you were almost enjoying it!
i see it all the time!
if you see commander riker or any of my crew, give them this.
but that ship and all the borg on it were destroyed.
the alien ship detected the warp signature and is on its way to rendezvous with history.
i hate to break it to you, but there is no person in number five.
but i'll check it out if it makes you feel better.
my mother lost her virginity to that song, i believe.
all right, pour it on me.
they're a positive earth-centered religion.
according to our receptionist, it just appeared, with nothing but a note for me.
something about it really upsets me.
i help people who are lost, find themselves again.
i always thought it was kind of a scam.
it's what you do with your time that matters.
you had him all wrong.
in your spot, i'll almost choose the cops, even if it is a first-degree murder rap.
it's lucky i spotted you.
the witches, he refers to them as the lords of salem.
now, heidi says that the music that she received came to her directly from the lords.
she must have been one spicy tamale.
she was a product of the depression, man.
what exactly is it that you needed from me?
no, no, no, but i did read it in depth.
"well, basically hawthorne was obsessed with, in his words, "" the master witch "" margaret morgan and her coven of six, whom he dubbed the lords of salem."
let it burn through our souls and our minds.
she was trying to stop it from spreading.
if you're not ready to lose one, you're gonna lose them all.
no, it weighted a lot, i'll bring it tomorrow.
but you write it small because it's not a proper noun.
we are going to take your daughter to ask her some questions, madam.
they were from the army!
i am sure that they brought him here.
i've made him spit it.
didn't they warn you?
the army took mi husband, and i can't find him anywhere.
so we can find who saw him last and help us locate him.
i don't want to suffer it again because of people like you.
count it, please.
working, she'll come later.
that's what they say, but i don't buy it.
the day i saw this room i knew that it belonged to a thief.
change it, and paint it blue.
your baby is being transferred.
we'll never fix it.
a spade will do it, but a dum-dum bullet is best.
he set fire to the house, got home, killed his wife and daughter.
i didn't even realise it.
i don't know about you, but when i think about spending 70 years on the same ship with that guy, it gives me a headache.
i want you to keep close tabs on the captain's shuttle.
bring them to cargo bay 1.
is it iunchtime already?
it's really something.
it's been encrypted.
i don't know about you, but when i think about spending 70 years on the same ship with that guy, it gives me a headache.
thank you, tuvok.
it's not over yet, chakotay.
what about trying it now?
it's been over an hour already.
we are in a crisis situation and we will follow procedure and procedure dictates that we wait for the right opportunity to attempt an escape whether it takes an hour or a week.
it's much more fun.
i heard about it from the doctor.
they're still off-iine.
it's been two days.
it's janeway's shuttle.
apparently, you do, but i'ii find them.
they're powering phasers.
well, start it up again, right where it left off.
try it now.
it is a tactical training scenario.
with that in mind, i began to write a training program for junior security officers, to prepare them for such an eventuality.
i realized the program itself might exacerbate the very conflict i sought to avoid.
i think i couid make it pretty exciting.
this isn't real life, tuvok, it's fiction.
are you saying that you're going to finish it yourself?
now, up until now, the story's been nothing but action, which is fine, but what it needs is a little heart, a little emotion.
i'm just making it up as i go.
you had your chance to finish this story and you wanted to delete it.
your friends will find it very difficult to get you out of here.
you're forgetting it was seska who rewrote the scenario.
none of it's real.
she programmed it to cause all of these shutdowns the next time tuvok reopened the narrative parameters file, which he didn't do until today.
i would imagine seska has made it very difficult for anyone to implement more than minor changes.
otherwise, tom and tuvok aren't going to make it out of there alive.
it's going to take a while to get tom and tuvok out of there.
they deserve to die.
no matter what we do, it rewrites itself so that tom and tuvok will die.
when we realized there was a mutiny in progress, we called them for a little assistance.
still working on it, captain.
it's over.
you see, i come from that very mysterious and unique place.
two twin planets whirling together around one sun, but each with its own and opposite gravity.
some people say that true lovers are one soul that is separated when it's born, and those two halves will always yearn to find their way back together.
they are unchangeable, and there are no exceptions.
they're saying it was a thief from down below.
i made it here, right?
will this cover it?
my husband says it's stainless steel from the main pipeline.
is it for sale?
well, i would love to, albert, you know, but... with this equipment, you know, it could take years.
a chance to fulfill everyone's dream and transform his life working for transworld.
mm, they're merely adapters.
will it, mr. kirk?
look, i didn't mean it like that.
uh, everything before that is gone.
sometimes things come back to me in dreams, but i'm never sure if they're real or if i'm making them up.
i mean, it's been, like, ten years since you last saw her.
they're just jealous, that's all.
why-why are you so obsessed with those people anyway, huh?
you know, my brother was the same way.
but he had like a troubled childhood.
it's top secret actually.
it's their loss.
all right, pablo, if i could get you one thing, one thing from up top, what would it be?
you dropped your papers and i helped you pick them up.
women, well, they're more like contractors.
you know, they build to last.
if it fits, you are through with overheating.
transworld are going to curse the day they fired me.
i don't get it.
it's impossible to change gravity's status.
without it, there is no cream.
take them off.
i mean, they might be rich, sure, but... it's definitely not paradise.
i can't believe it.
it looks as though that's been sheared off.
anything you need, they'll try and make it happen.
guns, drugs, all of it, man.
turning the town and the sheriffs against them?
suddenly the pretty guy they gave the gavel to, he ain't looking all that smart.
then let's find frankie, get the truth, take it to the table.
yeah,' cause every 32-year-old man needs a friend to chaperone him while he's underwear shopping.
because they paid my mother's medical bills while she was dying of cancer.
stands to reason that it's powerful enough to snap me back in.
walter, do you think that eugene is trying to make himself visible?
that he's killing people in order to steal their pigment?
i didn't understand what it was, but it must be acting as some kind of conductor.
i didn't know what it was at first, all pale and white.
it took me a while to see it was mr. ryerson.
now, if anyone can hope to undo what they've done to you- -
it's designed as a service bay.
well, this isn't about curing himself.
so in conclusion, on a scale of 1 to 10 10 being the highest, 1 the lowest, and 5 average, i give it a 9.
then perhaps you'll tell us the name of the pirate.
after dinner, it's down to business.
i'll put it on the refrigerator.
sorry, i can't do it on purpose.
find an egghead and pump him for some answers.
i bet he didn't study again.
richard laughed milk through his nose.
damn thing never goes over, does it?
yeah, but don't say it like that.
the screams, the humiliation, the fact that it wasn't me!
i know it's asking a lot, but if anyone can do it, you can.
""" could they make decisions that americans could support? """
that from that equal creation, they derive rights- -
it's only fair.
so they started to chip away at that ice to get that horn out and then it cracked and split in two.
it's important to understand about clovis, though, that they aren't just stone points, they also made some very lethal and effective bone and ivory points as well.
the most common that we've found them directly associated with are mammoths, bison and mastodon, in that order.
and over on the other side of the site, you can see the clovis level and you can see artefacts below it.
and if the claims coming out of south america are to believed, then they may have even earlier and more compelling evidence than i've seen here in texas.
ahead of me is a three-day journey, but one i hope will be worth it.
when these caves were excavated, it became clear that they had been home to ancient people.
they tell us that people are surviving in a very different environment.
it challenges the traditional story of how the americas were colonised.
i'm gonna have a go at measuring it out, but i think i might come into some difficulties, because of where the stream is today.
and amazingly, we know how this hut was built, because the remains of the wooden stakes and the animal hides that covered it were preserved in the waterlogged ground.
some plant remains, a few of them seaweeds that are still used by the mapuche indians today as medicines.
it's the first evidence anywhere in the world of humans using, eating potatoes.
it was found stuck in the ground, as though it was a tent peg.
using radiocarbon dating on charred wood from the site, scientists could pinpoint its age.
it belonged to a woman who was in her early 20s when she died.
you see that asians, they have very wide cheekbones.
so if these early americans look more like australians or melanesians, does that mean that they arrived here across the pacific?
but then how do you explain the fact that modern living native americans don't look like luzia, they do look like east asians?
but they used the same route as the mongoloids did some couple of thousand years later.
unless, rather than coming across the ice, the first americans found a way to get around it.
well, at the peak of the last ice age the water level would have been so much lower than it is today that many of these fjords would have been steep-sided valleys.
and they're fairly nondescript-looking things, but i can put it on the screen over here.
in fact, the only other route i can think of that they could have come is really down the coastal corridor, using these early de-glaciated areas as stopping places, as they worked their way south.
they're called the channel islands.
it's only found among 2 % of american indians.
we've found it among the caiap6 indians in coastal ecuador.
so for you, does this really clinch it?
it was the first day of vacation and the sun had returned.
it brings me luck.
children who believe the world has rules, and you just have to follow them to be happy.
don't eat it.
don't eat it?
throw it away.
your husband is radioactive.
he's not a man, he's a reactor.
all residents must leave their homes.
i heard a woman tell her son we were going to picnic in the forest.
she didn't want to cry, but the fears just came.
don't forget to give it back.
it's our first time back in pripyat.
it pays well.
it's about time.
i thought it was over between us.
don't go near, it's radioactive here.
maybe, but it's better than your tiny flats in slavutich.
it's so quiet here.
the people have left this land and god has taken it back.
today, it feels like one long day repeating itself
it is used here in the service of ukraine, of europe, and the entire world.
they've been talking about it all morning.
try them.
can you feel it?
no, it's not dangerous.
they put out the fire at the plant.
the banks of the seine, it's not the pripyat.
if we can find his stash, we can use it to blow up the suvek.
we know they're hiding it in quadrant d somewhere, but that's it.
she's always looking for new ways to promote the integration program, so she's using it as a pr opportunity.
think of it this way... if we fail and the trags detonate that thing, a whole lot of people are gonna end up dead.
what are they gonna think when you come waltzing into the sector with a montrose?
they asked me to give this to you.
it says that the hwatab is on the verge of announcing roman as the new iksen.
locating the hideout only works if you make it back alive to tell us where it is.
gotta figure out how to safely get it outside the sector.
if you move too quickly, it'll tear open.
something they plan to use against the humans.
we used his explosives, hoping to pin it on him.
we need to steal the suvek and get it outside the sector.
if you want to know how to move it out of the sector safely, you're gonna have to sit down and listen closely.
i don't know what they're planning, but i can tell you where to find it.
this cuff, it's been in my family for generations.
the last time i saw it, castor was wearing it.
you're going to keep me tied up here while my friends risk their lives trying to steal that thing?
the second the suvek passes out of the sector, it will release an electrical pulse... that will kill anyone within 30 feet.
i'm not letting it slip by because you're waiting on your boyfriend.
you know, you might have emery believing that you have nothing to do with it, but i'm not buying it.
your friends shouldn't have picked a fight they can't win.
their pods are the most secure in the sector.
she'll find the suvek and the phones you planted.
her trust.
she'll stop them before they make a move.
the second it leaves the sector, it's gonna send an electrical charge that'll kill anyone within 30 feet.
hopefully, by tomorrow morning, the trags will be on their way to the crate.
it's okay.
the suvek was stolen by roman and his friends.
it'll probably be boarded up by the morning.
it's for sale.
it's not.
it wasn't.
i have 15 creditcards and they're all maxed out.
they're adorable.
so is there any way i could come back later and check it out while you're showing them other places?
and we're not buying it.
all right, but you guys have to help me carry it.
that cork is the size of a softball and you're pointing it directly at wendy the waitress's face.
if you see something you like, just take it.
they're asian.
before we get the apartment i want to put in a kiddie pool and swim around in it naked.
he is the head of the household.
whenever mshall anlily have a big argument, they always leave a trail of evidence all over the apament.
they were fighting because they didn't get the loan and it's all lily's fault.
they're back.
it seems like this is a way to do it.
don't worry, they shut it down on the weekends.
from now on it will be a small team.
it is a patient.
the bad news is that we do not to curb it.
we've been planning it for months.
go and have fun, you deserve it.
does she know that he died in my arms?
porter, she knows what has happened to your son.
good morning, mr. porter, it's time for your morning round.
she is not like them, we grew up with.
it was only one summer.
calling the tower, it is eagle eye one.
please mr arias message that his son should be stoned as a motherfucker!
can we not talk about it after the wedding?
it separates you from the others.
but now i pick up the first aid kit, and then we get to grips with it.
a man asks his wife :
his wife thinks about it and then says :
what could it be?
we saw it when we came.
do not touch it!
it's a card!
if you have a guilty conscience, you can mess up for it now.
you can not contact the mainland with it.
the award-winning researcher leaves the island and no one will know that he is responsible.
josh, take his weapon.
it may well be, sewer leading into the sea.
listen, my brother must be on board the boat and it must be now.
it may come to an end here and now!
if we can reach the cdc in time, it may be cured.
it is situated on the beach.
i'll do it.
porter has taken it.
he just made it look like he had. so he couldn't rely on depth perception.
now both know the other survived and where they are.
i left this bim because a dead man was holding it.
but it seems i need it now.
i just picked it up.
and it stinks.
but it doesn't matter.
this'll make it a lot easier to get the food.
do you know where it is?
send two radar pings if you find it.
most of it's long past its expiration date.
get rid of it!
well, everything he was looking into and all the stuff we found - - this little baby connects all the dots.
he just wants a name, and we're just gonna give him that name.
let's head up there, let barrett know his number's up.
why go to where he's strongest?
you sure you want to play it straight?
i've been flipping through it, and it appears to be a book code.
how'd you get it?
if he can't deal for it, he'll try to steal it.
he took her life savings.
he was good.
one of them actually quit after he met charles.
he's gonna send someone after it.
and a portable defibrillator packs enough punch to make their heart skip a beat without stopping it entirely.
couple of women he bilked in england went missing when they complained.
so he doesn't just steal from defenseless women, he murders them.
i think it's time for some chuck finley action.
those heels are hot, but they look positively evil.
i don't do business like that.
it's good to meet you.
my husband and i built her together, actually.
"that's why she's named "" back pain ""."
when charles wakes up, he will have had one hell of a night.
he's the guy who wants the bible.
and you bought it off him on the spot.
you can run, or you can stay put and make it look like you have a reason to be there.
a guy can't make out with his girlfriend?
how's it coming with our not-so-sneaky bug?
if charles can't find that thing, he's more of a dumb-ass than we thought.
the sneak preview should make it very clear.
you send any more of your little thieves for it, we're gonna burn it.
i told my money manager, but he thought i was talking rubbish!
and you said they were following you.
a couple of guys just showed up outside her house with guns.
she's hiding in the closet.
they don't just try to get by the door.
they use it as a weapon.
ain't gonna be easy, and it ain't gonna be cheap.
i need every cent of it, including your share!
nobody blackmails me and gets away with it.
see, since you ripped off your money man, he wants you dead.
and that's a big problem because we told his guys where they could find you.
they're going to rio!

she said most girls spend more of their time thinking of their bridesmaid colors instead of the stuff that really matters.

some of our wealthier patients are a little used to having their own way.
or did you come to tell me i have a soul and you're gonna save it?
no, no, i did just fine, but there wasn't any life in it.
but the lord is still willing to forgive him, i mean really, really wanted to forgive him, if only he would ask, but he didn't.
but god is willing, and he's looking to forgive you as well.

he said the abandoned palace was full of treasure.
if it isn't the army.
it's like you have a magical bag that holds everything.
both my parents died, but they left me the house and the fields, so i was getting by alone.
that guy was one of them?
who can they be, calling in the army?
but i had no idea it had mysterious powers.
i know it as one who has spoken to rocks all my life.

it's been too hard for the good people and too easy for the assholes.
three hours later, they struck back at their rival gang, the farmington one-niners.
their membership, their businesses, chains of command.
a gang sells crack out of their back room, we're gonna take that home.
everything bought with drug money, we're gonna take those assets, auction them off.
citizens whose fear and silence the gangs depend on... we are gonna make them a better deal than the bangers.
i can't do it without you.

all this stalling, getting the hybrids, taking my ring, add it up.
he's the only family that i have left.
i will shoot the boy right in front of her!
stefan and damon didn't tell you about it?
and if connor dies, then we'll lose it forever.
and you're the biggest monster he'll ever meet.
it's not you.
you're afraid of those spirits and what they might do to your grams.
we could have saved him.
she helped me get through it.
haley and i can help them.
yeah, i heard about that.
yeah, tell me about it.
had to go through six locks to get it.
well, if i'm going to ride this fairy tale to its conclusion, let me be clear about one thing.
so if we do this, we're doing it for you.
it look like christmas up in here.
okay, first of all, it's a company apartment.
"their "" hocus pocus "" is hanging by bloody fingernails to just south of 40."

""" get a pop on it. """

this, zak, this is how people get their noses broken.
i'm just putting it out there in the universe.
it's just... you hurt me, richie.
galasso's niece is a big fan of the j-5, so i got her and the friends backstage passes.

it's seven hours till our flight.
boy, pheasant just lands on your shotgun, doesn't it?
it's like you're born into a new world.
they mingle, they pass the peace pipe.
or what they don't.
""" hocus pocus, "" it's catchy."
that's what it was.
okay, take it easy, champ.
don't even look at him.
if elvis's colonel klink calls us, let's not even take it.
we'll earn it.
they're not here.
he told me to come up after the show.
yeah, old bill black, man, he used to get a hold of that bass, that dog house, get on that one string, boy, he'd lay on it.
christmas is where artists bury their careers.
kissing them old ladies, i got a sore.
yeah, bring them.
a little late for entertaining, ain't it?
they did this?
when it goes critical, make sure you're far away.
will she be all right?
some of her wounds were pretty nasty, but... she'll make it.
i've never seen anything like it.
we barely made it out alive.
it's derezzing, and there's no way to stop it.
i might be able to attach the propulsion unit from your chopper to my lifeboat, modify it to work in water.
your playing proves it.
it's not very hard.
the key is to use your opponent's momentum against him.
they're leaving, thankfully.
look, i can't talk about it.
it's the only one i have.
the isos derezzed them, took everything of value, then fled.
collaborating with traitors must be punished, as an example to anyone else who might consider helping them.
they might want to hear' em.
weird--weird would be if the train stopped, and when you got off, it was suddenly the 1940s.
i was thinking about it.
so, if we combine them, i could get a tote bag.
so you're saying the butler did it?
don't worry about it.
no, i am gonna worry about it.
i mean, how much time does this guy have on his hands?
um, it's hard to see him through these strings of black material.
i don't think you are, actually, but it doesn't matter, laura, because he has no authority here.
you wouldn't ask a black woman named destiny if that was really her name.
""" speak the speech, i pray you, as i pronounced it to you."
""" trippingly on the tongue ; but if you mouth it, as many of your players do."
what are they up to now, baby?
this is the third time that she's gone off on a buying spree... picked herself out a whole new wardrobe and charged it to healy.
she just looks at a man, and right away he starts... scraping sand with both feet.
and he knows it.
our town has got 22 of them, but my theatre is the very best.
all right, boys, lift them up.
you better hope it does you more good than it did them.
that is, if they ain't getting it on the stage.
they're all made out.
keeps them on their toes, knowing i can see them.
you can tell de leon he can keep it all... like he wants.
it's one of our big, big successes.
last month, the mayor's wife started running around... with a young stud like him... and the mayor shot him stone dead.
but he owns the theatre.
it should be the healy theatre.
they are so.
it's not legal here.
they ain't actors, they're crooks.
you look at him like that again, i'll smack you.
he took over what we owe for the dresses.
they are?
but that's all i've got.
don't even give them a window.
if i don't get them, the indians will.
if he gets here, it will cost me a great deal of money.
gotta pay these men double wages to get them out here... and they can't even set a pole straight.
injuns pulled it down.
where are they going?
ted and bill, where are they?
but to leave them like this, it.
them injuns are riding without their squaws.
i ain't a man to look for trouble, but i don't run from it.
i usually run from it, but not always.
and they make the maps.
we'll be on the stage before you know it.
it ain't money that she lost.
i wouldn't know how to use it anyway.
every time it rained, we all went swimming.
it wasn't much of a company.
""" everything happens for the best, "" that's my new motto."
what do i do to get this, what did you call it, stake?
yeah, he wanted them killed, and he was paying good for it.
no, with a note from me, telling him to give it to you.
sure, and he will give it to me just like that?
there's $ 500 of it for you.
just for holding it?
we'll persuade the natives there to part with some of their gold.
it is also recommended that the shipment of ore, coke, and bullion... be entirely taken over by the de leon transport company... since this will ensure a marked saving in the transportation costs.
that man you sent, what was his name, gallagher?
it's a pity, a young man like that to have such bad eyesight.
you are very sure i'll give it to you.
for a clever and rich man to save $ 5,000 and lose everything... it's, how do you say, a false saving?
she'll be leaving in a few minutes.
i won't be needing them anymore, mama.
i stole it from mabry.
did you think you could just give me this and i would take it?
even the way you think... did you really think i would take it?
they can't act and i don't know how to tell them.
no manager would look at them, you know that.
i'll stage mazeppa for you and play it... until i can make enough money to pay back what i owe.
""" why, how is it my pretty bird... """
old de leon's got his boys watching this place.
i said stay out of it.
and he's drunk.
first to find that silly man, and then to get him to open that silly bank.
that was all i owed him.
he thinks we'll be a big success in bonanza.
and i want a man of your nature, not his.
it'll destroy us.
but when i fell in love with you, it was not because of the story.
don't beat yourself up about it.
dylan's actions were his and his alone.
it's gonna keep this town safe.
you try and keep' em afloat for a while, but... before you know it, you're both... sinking into the mud.
what is it, the executioner?
brenda let you out of her sight.
it sickens me.
and the lord said in his heart,
it doesn't tell us who she is.
it's able to hone in on hefty's dominant trait.
if that vegetable hat can tell us that hefty is strong, maybe it can tell me what an ette is.
power it up, brainy.
somehow, instead of sending energy out, you absorbed it.
find smurf village, capture all the smurfs, drain them of their magic and, finally, use that magic to become the most powerful wizard in the world!
well, it's my telescope.
"i'd prefer it if you just called me "" papa. """
is it a person, book or movie?
babies crawl on their knees.
azrael, it's not your map.
and then, just for good measure, we'll think about it some more.
it's quite painful.
watch it!
when i find those smurfs, i will ground them for a month of blue moons.
according to my manual, it should spark right up.
maybe they'll be orange.
we gotta help him.
you won't regret it.
brainy, cut it out.
she's a girl.
everyone can just introduce themselves later.
he's a dangerous wizard who wants to capture all smurfs and use them for his evil magic.
bring them along.
he has a map with a landmark leading him to three tall trees.
you know, he's your typical wizard.
sweet mercy, they're bottom feeders!
they've been terrorizing us the entire journey.
it's like she's one of us now.
put a cork in it, smurfette.
the way i see it, you and your little boyfriends led him straight to us.
it's not like that.
it was all part of the plan.
because it was her purpose.
she's tough.
i'm saying it to be constructive.
did the smurfs do this so that i would be distracted and not be able to destroy them as easily?
their norms are based on chauvinism, nationalism och egotism.
it became a game of words.
i'm not totally sure about this, but it was a small group of people.
they never asked the chinese or the russians for help.
they didn't execute their prisoners.
go to the streets and ask people if they've ever heard of anybody being tortured.
the doctors say that it helps with the blood circulation.
the citizens chooses and nominates their choice of candidates.
i hope the american people will play a defensive role when it comes to defending the idea of a better world with a more human system.

this is a surgical case, and you know it.
we can't just pull them out.
the bike race claims its first victim.
he could wake up.
and somebody sewed this tear in his shirt.
and he has one of those electronic key cards.
he likes me.
it's a hotel key card.
i can feel it.
you get him into surgery.
you should reprimand him.
kills you, doesn't it?
um, corneal transplants can give someone back their sight.
it's his skin!
but there are other people walking, people driving, people trying to live their lives on that concrete mountain.
one of them got his brains scrambled' cause one of you little sniveling no-good snot rags.
my heart tells me it's a boy.
they made sport of us.
and you welcome it?
i thought tristan should let me command his men.
oh, i think it's better we don't bother with names.
they also died when i was a child.
why are we capable of feelings if we're not to have them?
why long for things if they're not meant to be ours?

i decorate it.
it's my fault.
if i expose them, it'll break marke's heart and his hold on the other barons.
surely, do we neglect it already?
it's compensation... for the men you'll lose attacking d'or with donnchadh tomorrow.
for too long, the ablest among us has been denied his rightful place.
how i curse it.
so when he came to the tournament at dunluce... to win donnchadh's daughter, he didn't realize it was me.
now you know what to buy me for my birthday and the next five after that.
now they work for me.
it was my phone, you crazy bitch!
it's a video message they got from her the day before she disappeared.
miami p.d. interviewed all the housemates, but devon never mentioned it.
that usually means they're not feeling their tax dollars at work.

she definitely knows something about her disappearance.
defend, knee, elbow.
all right, now we're gonna do the same technique, and i want you to visualize yourself doing it perfectly.
police tossed her room pretty good, huh?
it's ray's case.
they don't travel well.

whilst agent thomas and i have a chat with mr. dreyfuss, perhaps you could divine what it was he sought from the smithsonian.
he reminds me that our time here can always be cut tragically short.
it was all my work.
all they saw was ansel.
of course, i knew the investors, they'd file suit to get everything back, but at that moment... it didn't matter.
i've often wondered wh-what it was about that particular moment.
do you or don't you recognize any of these?
the fact i didn't want to give it to her?
it's the adrenaline- - when you hear everything, you smell everything, you see it all, but it's like you're in a tunnel.
you know, my daddy was here, and his daddy before him.
i crushed a man's jaw with a metal pipe so that he'll eat through a straw for the rest of his life.
you really think the state's gonna give you a stay for that?
and i bet he's not gonna leave as long as there's still a chance.
i didn't want him to get in trouble again.

when she was born, i used to take her to the playground and the grocery store, whatever.
i'm comfortable with it.
being the kicker, you think it would be.
it gives a complete physical in just five minutes.
i wanna make sure she's getting the best medical care possible.

that poor guy thinks he's a valet.
it's the magic of cleveland, ladies.
do i need to spell it out?
they're ready for you in the o.r.
i just wanted to hear them say my name on tv.

they're not interested in a deal.
there's still time for you to walk away from this case before it destroys what's left of your reputation.
i'm glad to hear that.
i had one just like it.
'cause we found this inside it.
it's very fascinating stuff.

what's that family going to do when they find out you've been lying to them all these years?
and if someone flatters you, you have a hard time keeping it shut.
so, that man there, did he enter or leave the building that day?

no, my daughter's education ended the night that those bastards attacked her.
jules, need you to call hq and have them put a tail on cliff.

he's downstairs.
this junkie won't be able to help you in court, but you'll want to hear what he has to say anyway.

because that shadow hasn't gone, it's moved.
they won't believe you.
how do you know they're not androids?
goes for all of you, stay in the light!
other dave, the way you came, does it look the same as before?
something came to this library and killed everything in it.
but they're wrong,'cause it's not irrational.
it's what's in the dark.
seriously, don't even let them touch.
ah, going by your face, i'd say it's early days for you.
but it's a phone.
it's not ringing, sweetie.
they don't want me.
what's she gotta do with this place?
cal, what is it?
kept talking about his shoelaces.
the nice woman, is she there?
only you can save them.
the doctor, you travel with him.
i sent him a message, but it went wrong.
most planets have them, but usually in small clusters.
okay, let's move it.
can't send the others, tardis won't recognise them.
light doesn't stop them, but it slows them down.
don't do it.
but when it came time to pay - -
yeah, but we're gonnget it back.
so it's a smash and grab.
for a hell of a lot more than it's worth.
does it look like i canceled?
it just walked through the door.
he knows where i am.
it's a cowboy thing.
they gotave, so into a fight, these guys.gh.
how'd he find us?
i'm not saying it every five seconds!
he thinks he is the fiddle.
he's gonna sing my brother's song.
i wouldn't have gotten away with it.
oh, they got into a fight.
yeah, but, really, how'd you do it?
i just wanted to know what time it was.
a patriot making illicit deals for his government looks a lot like a traitor making black-market sales for his wallet.
this lady fabricated a decrease in sales from her husband's account book to feed her slush fund and they say she's looking around to see where she should invest.
in other words, she's just blindly holding money, she won't be able to report anything even if she gets her pockets emptied.
if i ask something then answer it, don't question me!
oh my, was it to your taste?
look, the weather is cold so you see all the people have their hands on their coats.
the goal is to make them take those hands out.
those kind of guys, if they linger around you, just bite them.
well, even if seoul is big, it's just within the palm of the hand.
so we are still negotiating it.
well, it's the first time today so it is the first snow.
people seemed like they couldn't hear my real voice!
brother, the mermaid just talked, she asked for help.
and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suit then they want you to wear one of theirs.
fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks.
it's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming.
so i get in the water in this thing, and it's, like, floating around me somewhere.
i'll hide it so nobody can find it.
you're not paying for it.
but it's real, it's water.
where were they five years ago?
he gave it to me.
he offered it to me.
well, i liked it.
she has some mouth on her.
they're talking about it right now.
here, let me see it.
it's making a dent.
nobody uses it.
i don't even know how to work it.
i keep telling her it's like an oven in here.
because if you don't, give it back to him.
all he said was he liked it.
you're giving him back that pen.
oh, my god, i forgot all about it.
it's from scuba diving.
listen, mr. klompus it was a nice gesture to give me the pen, but i don't really need it.
you didn't give it to him?
did i take it?
i've been looking all over for it.
well, that's it for them.
it requires hard work, dedication, and commitment.
but we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk it put mrs. ziven out of commission for a few weeks.
he gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back.
well, they're all gonna leave.
he's a brilliant lawyer.
morty arnold says they need six votes to throw you out.
it's in the constitution.
they love heat.
if they ever decide to land men on the sun i think these old retired guys will be the only ones that will be able to handle it.
he is pretty.
it'll be over soon?
and they are safer now.
i got men working triple shifts guarding that perimeter, men with families inside, and they have no idea what's going on in there.
give them an hour a day to talk
and i'm sorry you had to see that.
oh, i grabbed it for him out of the old lost and found.
you can't, like, link up our phones to make them stronger?
what are they doing?
you'll get it done.
or at least lie to it.
right, because you let lommers tie them.
it'll help you see things more clearly.
why don't you take one of these bags and go share it with your family?
and the ones i need are tangled in a web of bureaucracy trying to find their way to me.
it seems to be a popular place to drop them.
it's probably pretty looted, but i could check it out on my next patrol.
and you're here talking about precedents, like... like it's something we might have to live with for a long time.
are you saying she's safe in there without me?
you are not gonna use him to make headlines.
i just want to get his side of it.
when that baby is crying and it's 2 : 00 in the morning, it's another story.
xander is not like that.
it didn't receive any medication.
as you can see, it's already beginning to deteriorate.
it's ugly, it leaks, and it mocks me from the cupboard when i'm home.
anyone who judges you for it is just... just hiding their own stuff.
they'll be in various stages of shock, but any information you might get could be the key to apprehending these suspects.
yeah, uh, security footage verified it was a woman, even though she was never caught.
he had blond hair just like you.
guys, if you think about it, even the dates mean something.
ok, so is it a coincidence that those are all election years and they attacked d.c.?
all of the details are a part of their story.
their timeline suggests they were both destructive before they met.
and if he met someone like-minded at that time, there'd be no stopping them.
i didn't overthink it.
it just weakens the entire base that the house is sitting on.
she'll be charged with multiple counts domestically, and our international counterparts will have their turn with her.
i just thought you'd like to know that.
emily, look, i know you don't want to talk about it, but it's exactly why we need to talk about it.
it's the only reason you would be this quiet, emily.
and you're gonna do it.
but you're thinking about it.
you want to check it out with me?
for four years, you've been taking sam cavanaugh to your apartment and forcing him to perform sex acts.
hey, pal, according to sam it is.
i would never do anything to hurt him.
sam told his mother about the abuse, but not before she confronted him.
from sam's manipulated perspective, he's protecting the one man who loves him.
they're the easiest victims to control and the least likely to turn on him.
i am sorry you had to go through it.
i don't want to talk about it anymore!
i wonder what dirty little secrets he shared with that shrink.
this guy doesn't keep anything about his victims.
well, he collects every single porno ever made, though.
boys probably like spending time here'cause it's a iot more fun than their own house.
get their motor running, and then just take it a iittle bit further every time.
it's not department of defense grade, but it's pretty thorough.
barnett just loved listening to his fellow sex offenders disclose.
getting his rocks off while he's supposed to be getting rehabilitated.
it was a first offense, and there was no evidence.
assuming you can even find the victims, they rarely want to testify.
the fact is, you had a slam dunk with sam cavanaugh, and you blew it.
that's hearsay, and the iaw doesn't allow it.
he talked about how guys liked to look at them'cause it made them feel good, and that nothing was bad about that.
i don't think it'ii take very long to get an indictment.
when did it happen?
that's why i never told anybody.
he'd iike to put it behind him.
barnett wants to put this behind him, you tell him to plead guilty.
mostly partial, nicknames, but we'ii track them down.
it'ii help us establish a pattern of behavior, but the statute's probably expired on all of them.
barnett used to like to find his victims through referral from whoever he was molesting at the time.
now, the defense attorney's going to try to confuse you and make it seem like you misunderstood what happened.
mr. barnett will be there, but he can't say anything to you.
how long do you think it'ii take?
i want to know if barnett had any contact with him.
the complaining witness is no ionger available, and the prosecution cannot meet its burden of proof.
my client has a right to confront his accuser.
mr. barnett told him they couldn't speak, and he hung up on the kid.
i would argue their entire relationship led to the witness's attempted suicide.
where did roy keep his?
i guarantee roy sent him tapes, too.
write her a note and slip it under the door.
maybe someone stuffed the pills down his throat.
if we hadn't found them, we would have never known about his other victims.
don't even try it.
petrovsky acted like i killed her dog.
the ends justify the means because you got away with it.
i do fear the people choose caesar for their king.
ay, do you fear it?
then must i think you would not have it so?
his coward lips did from their color fly, and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his luster.
"ay, and that tongue of his that bade the romans mark him and write his speeches in their books, alas, it cried, "" give me some drink, titinius, "" as a sick girl."
when went there by a time, since the great flood, but it was famed for more than for one man?
casca will, after his sour fashion, tell us what hath proceeded worthy note today.
yet it was not a crown neither, it was one of those coronets.
there was more foolery yet, if i could remember it.
he was quick metal when he went to school.
and so it is.
either there is a civil strife in heaven, or else the world, too saucy with the gods, incenses them to send destruction.
a common slave, you know him well by sight, held up his left hand, which did flame and burn like 20 torches joined.
"when these prodigies do so conjointly meet, let not men say, "" these are their reasons, they are natural. """
for, i believe, they are portentous things unto the climate that they point upon.
'tis caesar that you mean, is it not, cassius?
let it be who it is.
he were no lion, were not romans hinds.
they that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws.
what trash is rome, what rubbish and what offal, that it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar.
such instigations have been often dropped where i have took them up.
what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged, that this shall be or we will fall for it?
i think it is not meet mark antony, so well beloved of caesar, should outlive caesar.
i am not well in health, and that is all.
brutus is wise, and were he not in health, he would embrace the means to come by it.
if it be no more, portia is brutus' harlot, not his wife.
for it sufficeth that brutus leads me on.
they would not have you to stir forth today.
decius, go tell them caesar will not come.
and many lusty romans came smiling and did bathe their hands in it.
it was a vision fair and fortunate.
and this way have you well expounded it.
"if caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper, "" lo, caesar is afraid? """
what, brutus, are you stirred so early, too?
""" there is but one mind in all these men, and it is bent against caesar."
delay not, caesar, read it instantly.
what is now amiss that caesar and his senate must redress?
let me a little show it, even in this.
only be patient till we have appeased the multitude beside themselves with fear.
let each man render me his bloody hand.
if then thy spirit look upon us now, shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death to see thy antony making his peace, shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes, most noble in the presence of thy corse?
then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
the evil that men do lives after them, the good is oft interred with their bones.
if it were so, it was a grievous fault, and grievously hath caesar answered it.
read it, mark antony!
we'll hear it, antony!
i remember the first time ever caesar put it on.
they that have done this deed are honorable.
what private griefs they have, alas, i know not that made them do it.
is it fit, the three-fold world divided, he should stand one of the three to share it?
and having brought our treasure where we will, then take we down his load and turn him off, like to the empty ass, to shake his ears, and graze in common.
i do not doubt but that my noble master will appear, such as he is, full of regard and honor.
he is not doubted.
ever note, lucilius, when love begins to sicken and decay, it useth an enforced ceremony.
what villain touched his body that did stab, and not for justice?
by the gods, you shall digest the venom of your spleen, though it do split you, for, from this day forth,
is it come to this?
i do not, till you practice them on me.
a flatterer's would not, though they do appear as huge as high olympus.
if that thou be'st a roman, take it forth.
omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries.
i'll have them sleep on cushions by my tent.
i put it in the pocket of my gown.
o, that a man might know the end of this day's business ere it come.
but it sufficeth that the day will end, and then the end is known.
my life is run its compass.
that's not an office for a friend, my lord.
thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.
hold then my sword, and turn away thy face, while i do run upon it.
he only, in a general honest thought and common good to all, made one of them.
mr. garrison will fail because you're making it up.
this is coffee the way it should be.
no, it's.
well, it's not.
that stupid self-centered bastar wrote about our sex life in his blog.
and then he just goes and has to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it.
it just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman, who's open to expressing her affection in non-traditional locales.
the relationship was broken beyond repair, and i walked over there, and i fixed it.
boy, that story gets better every time you hear it.
it's much easier to claim a land with a flag than to plow it.
banging on the wall with his fists, his head, kicking it, scratching at it with his fingernails.
the toilet's flooded, you can't get anywhere near it.
hey, he's not anyone's colleague!
listen, this is a spring mine, so just keep your foot on it and don't be afraid.
better send him to his brother's place.
at the very least, i would keep an eye on him myself.
would you like me to replace them?
we're recorded him at over three dozen scenes, all of which relate to the pattern.
the police showed her picture around the museum, but no one knew who she was.
you once referred to him as your friend.
also, the police found a book on a bench by the museum that had some kind of weird writing in it.
and they think it was his?
we're working on it now.
but beyond that, everything we know about these guys, the little that there is suggests that they just watch.
they don't get involved.
what makes her the exception.
whatever's going on, whatever william bell was warning olivia about, these people have the answers, i know it.
well, maybe it's a code.
walter's analyzing it now.
it looks like someone else has been investigating these symbols too.
it's one of mankind's earliest attempts at writing.
that's etched on the iron pillar of delhi.
we'll need to repair it.
they were driving on that bridge when it happened, when it collapsed.
that's the last photo she has of them.
it will be just a minute now.
whatever these observers do to keep from aging, they should market it.
they'd make a fortune.
it was this beautiful red velvet.
i didn't understand that it hadn't started.
it's one of my favorite memories of my mother.
we will continue to bring you live coverage of this disaster as it comes across our desk.
we will bring you live coverage just as soon as it happens.
that they can see the events before they happen.
i have observed this woman for much of her life.
she is unique.
we've already seen to it.
you know, if there's something significant about this girl, i just don't see it.
after her parents died, she was taken in by her mother's best friend, who was a veterinarian in worcester.
she got decent grades in college, and interned at art galleries in the summer.
three boston restaurants imported them last year, and one private citizen.
it's an apartment in cambridge.
we had an arrangement.
to correct that, the others will try to kill christine hollis until they succeed.
i merely see it.
well, in that case, if you cannot persuade the others of your conviction, then you must do something to prove it.
apparently, it was a great year for blubber.
ballistics tied his gun to six unsolved homicides up and down the east coast.
our techs had never seen anything like it.
they can't seem to make it fire.
the tip-off that the observer was spotted at that motel, it was called in from one of the motel phones.
and if he realized he couldn't do it on his own?
everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies very often, like meredith or kevin.
oh, i can't, because i keep them hidden.
i wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when i got off-stage someone had eaten all of them.
it's great.
well, i'd think if you use the same jokes, it just comes across as lazy.
no, no,' cause the ice melts, and then it's, like, second drink.
i xeroxed her driver's license, and she is not welcome at this restaurant chain ever again.
his last name isn't literally fantastic, is it?
we couldn't find a record of his bank account.
it's the regurgitated saliva of male aerodramus fuciphagus.
these people all seem pretty upset to have lost one of their own.
you kiss seeley booth on the lips and i'll make sure your daddy has his dream christmas.
and if your mom likes someone, then we should respect that and like them, too.
there's only one man who fits that description... but i think he's in jail.
i can't help it if the line is crooked.
we dig in, open up a hole underneath the safe... get the money, and they'll only figure it out on monday.
you'll only look after it.
i wouldn't call it nothing.
the guy who was going to help me plan the tunnel... he's not available anymore.
i didn't have to look for them.
it wasn't luck, they knew it.
they were tampered with.
i had my cash intake on the side... then it went wrong and i was the escape goat.
if anyone walks out, he's walking out dead.
it's 87 yards from the bank... but there's one problem.
the tunnel will have to pass underneath it.
how long to dig it?
the gas company comes and do their shit... the water company comes later and do theirs.
while you're at it, buy yourself a popsicle.
he knows is not allowed to wear a cap for one's id photo.
barao will kill you when he finds it out.
it's shit!
you didn't do it right!
it was saulo's idea.
it'll only take five minutes.
i tell you, he was really bad looking.
that's a huge coincidence, isn't it?
did he confess to it?
we'll have to, doc, it'll have to do.
the glass was from a fishbowl that fell and killed them.
if they're smart, they can benefit out of it.
we should've done it before.
that's not the point, caetano.
where can we dump him?
what are you doing with it?
watch out for the line,'cause it's crooked.
they were to contact him as soon as he arrived.
what will it be?
the money is safe, it's alright.
isn't it more exciting like this?
i was listening to your sermon... and i've just received some money... but it isn't from something illegal... but the others didn't follow the lord's words.
is it too much money, son?
if the money comes from sin, it's the devil's money.
you'd better donate it to church... so the lord can sanctified it through his works.
an agent saw this guy in a bar and recorded it on his cell.
it's a big case, an important case, you see?
there's a snitcher inside and i'll find out who it is.
they always make a bigger deal out of it.
open them up.
there's a snitcher inside and i'll find out who it is.
i knew all of those gangsters, their names... and that's why i was transferred here... but pcc is not here.
it's not right.
it's no bullshit, sir.
no, it can't be, i'm in the middle of the investigation.
it will be over when i say so.
for god's sake, i've nothing against it.
the workload here is no joke, it really isn't.
but it looks like you don't have a choice, come on.
our buddha has the lion's roar, you can't blame him.
every time you see him, it's as if you're haunting him!
this doesn't work well enough, let me change it.
abbot, thank you for letting us win.
you two are very tactful, well done.
they should know that sooner or later, news will go back to shaolin temple.
bury them outside.
the former abbot was killed by him.
doesn't have the same ring to it.
don't even think it.
don't thank him just yet.
it sounded better in my head.
they were about the struggle everyone has to find themselves.
it's not even date-ish.
"yes, well, i'm the one who has to drive home in a car with "" slut "" written all over it."
uh, but the kids are watching telly, so you're gonna have to keep it down.
alice figured it out.
if you feel emasculated because you don't go to work and you're staying home and doing the dishes, like, you can't take it out on your wife and then blame her for not wanting to fuck you or something.
if you want me to resend you that email where i go into detail about tumors in mice and hyperactivity in children, i can, but i think you get it.
but i need you, for your sister, to be there for her.
so, what we'll do we'll take this paper clip and we'll bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit.
someone's gotta unhook the boat before it leaves the place.
he has very strong feelings for it.
so i set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, i snap me a shot of a bare - chested kruger.
so george took my slicer down to kruger and they're smoothing it out for me.
find this woman tell her you're not a test-tube pincushion.
it's my medical opinion that you're making a big mistake and it's going in my chart.
so kramer pulled it off?
boy, did we take it on the chin last year.
now, that mole looks exactly as it does today.
when he went in for a swim, my sons and i took all his stuff threw it in the ocean, huh?
and i was in that photo until i broke in here stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of it.
now that you mention it, just a while ago when i met kana-sama, we talked about this
it should still be somewhere near gougata
it seems like he knew of you from very early on
well, they always give the same thing
then, how much interest should we put on it?
so a family can eat, every member is sold off until they must abandon the field.
it's not just 10 or 20!
tezuka himself won't even make a cent off of it
as long as they pay for it.
they say that redheads have a higher threshold for pain.
think that's what you need?
do they look like this?
yesterday he took out the intestines of a really old man.
your kids'.
i know he's not coming.
i wished it.
how's it paid for?
the secret, he explained, was to flip the omelet in the air and catch it in a frying pan.
when napoleon flipped the omelet, it fell to the ground.
and the signs of potential defeat are there for someone who knows how to recognize them.
where do you think he'll be next year?
forget it.
when an operator outlives his usefulness, we find in him, time and time again, the same signs.
first, he underestimates the danger.
it's in your best interest, and jonas', to keep this meeting between you and me.
roll ya for it?
the man wants to be rescued, he'll cooperate.
take it easy.
go ahead, it's not like it's made of baltic amber.
no, back it up.
uh, it's more of a casual gathering than a meeting, but i will speak to her about the case.
it's.
it's too much, this isn't right.
put it on.
petrino's at 7 : 00, just meet me.
i don't see him.
we can figure all this out, and you can tell me what it means.
but maslin's not the friend to our country he'd have you believe.
and who do i think he is?
he has a recording of the premier's illegal operation.
i think it's criminal.
no, the only good news is, that the doctors in the field are so good that soldiers are surviving wounds they never did before.
oh, there's the kids, of course, though now they're at summer camp.
oh, you're going to do it?
which it isn't even real.
that they deserve the best.
i didn't want the cleaning crew taking off with it.
i didn't hear about it, but then i'm sort of at the bottom of the ladder.
ryan gave me his orders, i carried' em out.
and register a concern, say your husband has changed, then it's official.
that information gets out, it means a new tribal war, the deployment of thousands of american soldiers.
the c.i.a. diverted the f.s.b. to get him back here safely.
back at it.
then why does it feel the way it feels?
are you sure your partner knows what he's doing?
i let him take a stroll.
mission goes sour, i answer for it.
it's the right move.
well, buddy, it's going to take more than a knife to get my life savings.
all right, look, just as long as the bitch back home doesn't get a dime of it, you can have it.
don't do that, you tickle me.
when you see a moon like that, do you ever think... life is so amazing and maybe we shouldn't waste it by just getting high all the time?
anyway, this is the area where they say they saw the creature attacking the animal control officer, even though he claims to not have seen whatever it was that was attacking him.
maybe this guy is its chief geneticist, who recklessly experimented on himself and now transforms into a fiend who needs to feast on human flesh.
it doesn't make any sense.
who takes advantage of someone like that?
you know, there was a recent comparative cognition study that showed that dogs hold hostilities toward people that harm their masters?
mulder, how did you figure out it was him?
whose genius idea was it to tie a piece of cloth around your neck?
it's waiting to strangle you.
is he dangerous?
it was a ring of corrupt cops in the nypd that ran a high-profit racket driving smugglers and drug dealers round the city.
since then internal affairs have been waiting to catch them in the act.
i came up with how to do it so no one got killed.
i said we'll make it.
he loved her.
iad indicted him on three murder counts before he was kicked off the force.
keaton was under indictment a total of seven times while he was on the force.
in every case the witnesses either reversed their testimony, or died before they could testify.
they said he went in to check a leaking gas main.
within three months of the explosion, the two witnesses, they were dead.
keaton fought it as best he could, but a man can't change what he is.
he can convince anyone he's someone else, but never himself.
i don't know what it is.
you know, it's an awful shame about saul gettin' whacked.
the cops are gonna be lookin' for the guys who did it.
sooner or later they're gonna come around asking' me.
they had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
whatever it was, it was very sensitive.
my employer sends his gratitude.
now, it has taken us some time to find you.
it seems ms finneran was a little too effective in expediting his release.
mr söze rarely works with the same people for long, and they never know who they're working for.
somebody working for a guy who worked for a guy who got some money from keyser söze, shit like that.
you think a guy like that comes this close to getting caught and sticks his head out?
if he comes up for anything, it'll be to get rid of me.
kobayashi doesn't seem to have a problem with it either.
i tried, but keaton wouldn't have it.
there's no mystery, no arch criminal behind it all.
if you got a dead body and think his brother did it, you're right.
i said i never heard of him.
so söze put some thieves to it, men he knew he could march into certain death.
a one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat cripple.
it was all keaton.

we can't stop the worm from hitting its target, so we give it a new target.
you think it can be done?
the worm identifies its target by looking for a unique set of heuristics.
well, if our analysis of the worm told us anything, it's that it's nearly impossible to predict.
yeah, i figured if i couldn't predict its sequencing, nobody else could, either.
it's about the payload.
that should do it!
do you see it?
well, as long as the worm recognizes it.
now, if he does, the worm will enter the phantom reactor, destroy the code structure, and disintegrate along with it.

so the law is designed in a way, in a very cynical way, to prevent palestinians from building, and to keep them confined in little islands, so that most of the land of the occupied territories is free for israeli settlement.
i mean, i think that that's the main problem.
they identify with the palestinian people as being their people.
they've been robbed of their ancestral lands.
their quarter, the christian quarter, has been really, really decimated and taken over and sliced up.
a very small minority adhered to zionism, the idea that the only place in which they could be safe is within a jewish state.
is it really true that israel was a land without a people for a people without a land?
it was a land populated by arabs, who had a high level of culture, a high level of education.
it helped to establish all of the structures of a state.
the palestinians saw a european power decide the future of a non-european territory, in flat disregard of both their presence and wishes.
in just five years, 174,000 jews flooded into palestine, doubling their population.
they were not responsible for the holocaust.
palestinians in israel lived as third class citizens of a state whose core identity excluded them, while those in the newly occupied territories and abroad continued as dispossessed refugees.
leaders of surrounding arab nations verbally championed their cause but failed to take action.
it has virtually no power.
instead of having a real national authority, you had this corrupt institution, whose main task, as far as israel was concerned, was to police the palestinians and prevent them from resisting the continuing occupation.
"like one case, the settlers went and took a house, palestinian house, and just said, "" well, now it's ours. """
so the border police stood down there to protect them, because the palestinians were angry ;

she's dead.

so it's possible that you have kids out there that you don't even know about, right?
it's another way for people not to take responsibility for their actions.
the man who attacked you will spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair.
little below your usual tax bracket requirement, isn't he, margo?
your client planned his attacks and tried to cover his crimes.
he intentionally selected his victims based on race, national origin, ancestry and gender.
would you say that his son inherited these violent tendencies from his father?
both parents must possess the recessive gene and pass it on to the child in order for the child to have the illness.
if they don't have the gene, the child will not get the illness.
so from a genetic standpoint, since harold starnes was a violent man, it's not completely out of the realm of possibility that his son was born violent, as well.
move it along, miss nelson.
if a man has a defect, is he absolutely going to be a rapist?
we know with the cystic fibrosis gene if a child inherits the gene from each of the parents, he or she will have the disease.
if we start to justify all antisocial behavior under the pretense it isn't our fault, then the entire structure of the iaw is meaningless.
the defense would have you believe darrell guan's life was beyond his control.
but the truth is, he was in complete control at the time he committed his crimes.
make him take responsibility for it.
you did have blood on your face, but it was from the cuts on your arms.

alice probably sealed up every window herself.
it is like an animal, but deformed.
where is she now?
why don't you just drink it?
once i almost did, but then barbara told caroline kish's mom that she'd have to pay her $ 9 an hour, because it was basically like babysitting.
you've seen them, who'd want to?
their makers send them out into the world unprepared for all the demons and enemies they'ii face.
she missed him so much, she couldn't be without him another minute.
it's a frisbee-sized wormhole, leonard.

eric, chop up some onions and mix it in with the meat.
he's such a jerk.
bend over and kiss it good-bye, bob.
i didn't kill them.
they would do the same thing over and over when they're back out in the world.
it's a good thing he's dead.
isn't it a good thing that he's dead?
since i cleaned up everything before i left, i'm sure it got swept away with other stuff.
he's a cop.
don't you dare tell him anything about slush funds or anything like that.
i think director nam had a hand in it.
right before the closing yesterday, of the five bank accounts we have... all the money has been taken out of it.
because of the incident with the lady, out deputy chief had his ears chewed out.
i'm sending jung woo back to his house.
i've already made up my mind about it, so don't try to do anything.
so, i'm sending him away before that happens.
i couldn't find where it was.
do you think it'll be too difficult?
if anything were to happen to you... it'll put zoey in a tough situation.
isn't it pretty?
i already looked into everything, and i didn't find anything like that.
even though i have a close relationship with their representative... but business is still business, and we have to be clear about that.
you can get that within a week, right?
hey, don't touch it.
but you went about it the wrong way.
i'm just telling you since harry is going to find out about it anyways.
make the newcomers come forward for their instructions.
the dead girl, i'm told, had deep scars all over her back.
but we have a new justice minister and he is bound to be zealous.
she's going to die.
oh, it must be ten years already.
shut your trap or it might rust.
you know very well that i have found my true vocation here and that i am devoting myself to it, body and soul.
the minister did inform me of it.
he would like to receive a daily report.
but you must send me a copy of it.
i was crazy about him.
she's dead.
i went with him.
they attacked me.
i tried to take it from him.
oh, i will give them to you.

our colleagues from caracas are visiting their sister city of miami.
yes, it is to fill your pit, to start to build a park.
con, not quite sure why that's a pro.
that's worth one viva.
they say hugo chavez will love this video, because it is another success for their committee.
"you call it, "" hugo chavez park ""."
i am going to build that park myself, and it is going to be awesome.
and it's not going to have a fountain shaped like hugo chavez's head spitting water all over everyone, unless that's what the people want.
it was one door in and one door out.
people didn't like bands doing their own original tunes if they hadn't been played on the radio.
"the club was actually what they called a "" go-go. """
you go to see a chuck show or a rare essence show or one of these shows, these kids take their tape decks in and they tape the show.
and all over the city, during the day, they're listening to these local bands.
downtown washington, dc was alive with its own music.
they were the first band influenced by punk rock, taking it much further musically.
"when people wanted to make a demo tape, they saw, "" hey, you've got a tape recorder. """
it was pretty much like a flophouse, really.
it's just like i realized you know, i'd found my home with the bad brains.
"it's this whole, like, confusion about being "" punk """
like, then they'd cheer and stuff.
that is as fresh and dynamic as the day that they recorded it.
so we just wanted to document the stuff'cause it was important to us.
it's like my bedroom from when i was a teenager.
when that guy's around, you just want to sit down and listen to him talk, man.
they're playing these giant shows.
the whites don't really know what's happening, most of them.
"we can get it going on, too. """

if dave had grown up in los angeles, he wouldn't be who he is.
i think in the nature of him growing up in dc and in virginia, you're sort of forced to find your own path.

"sort of the politics of, "" well, the world's a little bigger than just our little subsect of people and maybe we should care about that. """
she was watching this and all of a sudden, she started feeling ashamed.

you're taking advantage of these people who don't know where they are.
i'm taking them back where they belong.

they turned him over to the feds.
she's trained for it.
he might even have people right here in our own department.
i'll give you until noon tomorrow because i want these ladies here to enjoy what might be their last night on earth.

kate was proof of that, as are the feds that let him go.
it's a good place to start.
lyman said you gave him a lot of trouble.

she's on the right side of this war, whether you know it or not.

my father said that it would be the perfect place to stage a grieving mother's suicide.
my mom's got a team of lawyers that has every one of them paid off, which means the conservatorship sticks and she keeps control of my money.
he put me back in the car and told her she could find her own way home.
it sounds like he was the only one who was able to go a few rounds with mommy dearest.

he's taking it pretty hard.
they wanted him to stay the night, but he wasn't having it.
well, i'll take it from here.
it will be me who destroys her.
it's gonna be okay.
it feels so good.
in case she's a skank.
then again, her text speaks for itself.
it means something.
i'm trying to get a handle on it.
honestly, i don't get it.

a friend crashed his scooter.
i'd rather see it alone.

your muscles will thank you for it.
you're doing them a favor.
it doesn't matter.
yeah, with ericjust now, it wasn't very deep.
i didn't think it was that bad.
he's out of it, but the doctors are optimistic.

as véro says, it's all immaterial.
let's party, take your mind off it.
this is how it works.
nothing stands in his way.

it's the daedalus.
they're not gonna answer.
what are you telling me, rodney, this thing flew here by itself?
they wouldn't be sending daedalus iff, plus it doesn't explain how they got here, or why we're not picking up lifesign readings.
if the ship's command systems are as familiar as the rest of it, it shouldn't be a problem.
of course, we haven't had time to do a proper survey of the planet's surface, but it seems habitable enough.
i realize our chance of rescue is slim, but it's become obvious that we no longer have a choice.
we're trying to check it out ourselves.
it's similar to what happens when you open a hyperspace window, but different enough that the sensors wouldn't have picked it up automatically.
it's a drive all right, but it didn't move us through space.
look, a ship appeared in orbit above their atlantis, they came to check it out.
if i enable them, we might be able to jump sooner.
but if i do this, i can't undo it!
well, we're not imagining it, rodney.
actually, i think our best bet is just to transfer as much power as we can to the shields, and ride it out till the next jump.
most likely they're depleted, but if not, well,
think he did it on purpose?
which means it'll never make 100 before the shields fail.
rodney believes that in this reality, it was destroyed by an impact, possibly millions of years ago.
in fact, it was staring me in the face the whole time.
i was just too busy trying to avoid imminent death to notice it.
look, we know that the ship carries its momentum in real space from one reality to the next.
well, i wouldn't go that far, but still, it'll be... not quite as deadly?
they know we're the ones that shot at them.
to get past those aliens, we're gonna need sublight engines, and i'm going to need to fix them in time.

how's it coming with the sublight engine?
i doubt it.
look, i've barely got this thing working as it is!
if we tax it any more, we're gonna blow the whole system!
it's a long story.
we're just borrowing it for a while.
thank you, colonel, and one last thing, it's been a pleasure.
it's the first reality we jumped to.
it's time to get off this train.

the terrorist that blew herself up in the restaurant was your wife.
she never met any of them, never spoke to any of them.
i'm telling you, my wife had nothing to do with any of this.

we kept looking for the sequels, but no bookstore had them.
if you haven't understood a thing since you set foot here, it means you probably never will.
my wife, before she blew herself up, came here to meet her mentor.
the fact your wife told you nothing doesn't mean she betrayed you.
she simply had nothing to tell you.
i don't understand how a bigot like you who preaches tolerance can send women and children to their death while he hides in his hole.
"but siham came in my room with a wad of money, and she said, "" it's for you. """

i don't get it.
i bet they were defeated by the chain user before we arrived.
don't break it!
aren't you going to follow them?
the pilot already has his orders.
it's just the three of them.
bit by bit.

uh, i'll leave the boat for now and then maybe i can come back for it later.
jeffrey and i have our issues, i won't deny that.

i hope you can make it.
wouldn't miss it for the world!
oh, you know what a steinem is... it's a beer mug.
yes, that is totally it.
how did you handle it?
and last night, i started thinking about it, about her.
it's more of, um, like a spectrum.
i mean, think about it.
so, dixon tells me you're leaving us.
i mean, if sexuality is on a spectrum, does that mean that most people choose to be straight because it's what they know?
i don't think it's a choice for a lot of people.
but that doesn't mean that everyone's like that.
then again, everything i'm reading makes sense until it doesn't make sense, so.
it could have.

look, these girls, they get sick, they get diseases, they get pregnant, they need doctors.
lucky luciano, he had a woman that was like his main woman, his main squeeze.
luciano begins frequenting one of his own brothels, run by a madam named cokey flo.
there's something about them that you have in common which you don't have in common with your wife.

the police department, attorneys, they're all for sale.

plenty of girls who talked got burned with cigarettes... their tongues cut.
i didn't even know what heroin was, and... at first it was free.

my mother used to call me her skinny pencil.
henry put the lights on in his truck so we could see, and we were all out there with our spades, seeing what we could find.
and every time he found a potato, he'd hold it up for me to see.
it'll make the warmest fires you'll ever see.
henry, leave it.
i don't even know if it's delicious, but it'll fill you up.
she's not.
we read it over breakfast in my house.
i just remember how fetching my wife looked in her bloomers.
and to understand women and their breasts in general.
it's an unseemly publicity stunt.
plus, here is a man who is getting fake titties... not to raise his low self-esteem, but to heighten awareness about a disease.
sean, why is it that you can forgive christian, but not me?
excuse my language, dr. mcnamara, but your partner's a rude asshole... who acts like he knows it all, but in fact, he doesn't know shit.
it was an erotic fairy tale.
everyone had their aids and std tests.
they've already had 40,000 orders for the next one.

all the girls get them done now, doctor.
it's perfect.
i just think it could be better.
even though he's running him, the guy's challenging him all the way.
i called your offices and i was told you had it here.
i had a little fun with it.
how was it?

they don't deserve to have whores wandering about their home.

to jump into things without thinking of consequences... and now to jump out of them without thinking.
but for that, i want some bang for my buck.
i didn't think i had it in me.
it's a pity you didn't learn from my errors.
thinking about her with me just rubbed your face in it.
and then throw it away.
i get it.
the two of them were working as a team?
as a rule, demons have no empathy for any other species other than their own.
scaring people into giving you their money?
he didn't want the girls to see his eyebrows burnt off.
oh, it's nothing much.
and then it's gone, and you're like.
it's how it works.
somehow this is a trick, i know it.
it doesn't mean we rebound with the evil undead.
there's ghosts and shaking, and people are going all felicity with their hair.
in the midst of all that, do you really think they were keeping it up?
forgive me for asking this, but the children in your care, were any of them ever ill, or did anything ever happen to any of them?
i'd see them preening like jezebel, doting over their pretty hair.
you held them under.
and now the poltergeists are drawing more and more energy out of them.
they die.
that's how much an unmarked squad car costs.

dean madison was his name.
it's a bill for a tv camera and lens.
some of them are just marvelous people.
the department might have something to say about that.
nor do i like journalists using it as a way to increase ratings.
and the dust returns to the earth, as it once was.
the cast and crew knew about it.
it sounds pretty sick to me.
they're an escape, a vicarious release of fear.
the idea is to pick celebrities who won't make it because they're old, sick or in a high-risk profession.
that's what this is really about, isn't it?
maybe i'll start my own pool and put you on it.
we confirmed it with people in the game.
or someone else would get it first?
a copy of the dead pool and a letter explaining it.
newspapers print the dead pool and it hurts our investigation.
could you sign it to chester docksteder?
well, this is it.
i'll write him once a week about how i'm looking in on his sick mother and trying to get him special privileges here.
people can believe what they want, but nothing.
i've got to hear them.
do you recognize her?
they're all screaming for police protection.
this man sets himself on fire.

he said it'd be the ultimate peter swan film.
it must have been one of those in-depth interviews.

"you know, i was gonna keep it, but mr. "" i can't take candy from strangers """
in my world, they do.
but i didn't think it was my place to get involved.
because i'm lana's friend, too, and she asked me to keep it a secret.
i thought you, of all people, would respect that.
any friend of lana's would never let her get involved with him!
lana has no idea what she's getting herself into.
clark, let me remind you that you broke up with her.
if it wasn't for clark kent, i'd be in a morgue right now with tire tracks across my forehead.
it's about me.
he wants you to have a good time.
she told me what happened.
luckily, his trachea didn't collapse, and the doctor sedated him for the pain.
you were there when it happened?
it's not a card.
in fact, with his powers, he might even be the chameleon.
i mean, not only does this guy know about your powers but he could very well know about your weakness.
how would he know about the meteor rocks?
why is it that you feel the need to lob a grenade at every guy that i date?

yes, it's beautiful.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, do you see a beard?
i told you i'm not very good at math, ms. pokorny.
but i wasn't about to give up on those girls, because i, or whoever was down in that bunker, had them in there since 1998, getting ready for the rapture.
because the bible says... it's coming.
my point is, that man is dangerous, and he must be stopped, and there's only one person who can do it.
it's just another cult.
they're also to set the mood.
then he made the dinosaurs, but then he didn't like them, so he made them extinct and made people instead.

i said i'd know if violet had a problem with drugs and alcohol, but the more i think about it, i'm not sure.
it's on the sofa.
a lot of my college roommates partied just as much as i did, and they don't have a problem.
christy, i know it's painful because it's your kid, but nothing changes the fact that this is a self-diagnosed disease.
she's not a problem, she's a burden.
state's pulled all their embassy personnel.
i'll keep them on standby.
they're coordinating it out of the nctc.
i think i'll keep it right where it is until you start talking.
my father just let him stay here the one night.
but you talked to him?
mcquaid's got my phone.
i didn't know he still went into the field like that.
you're wondering how he knew about chicago?
i have to go and i.d. the body before they take it to the morgue.
from the reports i've read, she delivered altan to the cia facility but didn't accompany him inside, thus shielding herself from the blast.
if you don't know that, it's above your clearance.
they know not to come back until their pockets are empty.
well, i'm just curious about what your superiors said when you read them in.

he will find out, and i'll get crushed.
actually, it was two piles.
i guess he has a gambling problem and got into trouble so he sent the e-mail to a friend asking for help.
it's not an entrance if she's on time.

only girls they see in there are japanimated.
