michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, the one he shared his bed was his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for both of us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i will.
i need to write a essay about the moral side of the war and the ability of a conflict to prevent at least 000 words.
i'm not sure our ethics teacher would like me cheating while writing a essay.
so you passed my moral test.
as a matter of fact, he was desperately burned by the teacher of bethbaerlyad.
small crimes... can barely cut off the hand of any man.
no ring ring ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
the g.d.k.'s eye was on us.
your father thought it would make us look charity.
he must have faked my signature.
maybe a year ago i'll have a son... finish his cottage cheese!
you gotta get me out of this
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't look at him either
i don't have a mother's kindness and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yes-yes.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
meanwhile, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
why do i tell you this?
i guess there's some things you can't tell your father about
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set his teacher... to fulfill his motherhood.
there's nothing wrong with that.
but i have to explain to you that i'm a little hurt because you don't think about it.
auntie can do that.
and the teachers can do that.
surely someday you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay had never been so proud of what she said her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i was telling you about.
girl, really... young girl.
your date, nazh... your date, your
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma," you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache
yeah.
but gob misunderstood the emotional attraction that michael was courtesy... and felt he was fighting to get involved.
because, you know, beyond love... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
ich nazhgalia, michael, shannon really?
and there was a surprise visit to george sr.
i read all your teachings and i got all your tapes.
and i watched them all again.
george sr. had recently put a series of tapes on the market he'd recently explained to people about his solution to make money from his new spirituality.
i also lost two kilos eating your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to find out where
this is a good place to start.
and michael met lindsay at parent-teacher night after the two girls he was dating.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this room have the same floor plan as our kitchen?
i think she's perfect for you.
i thought you'd get it out of your head.
besides, i can't rush a job like this because my son wants to, and i can't marry someone.
i'm miss baerly, the vice teacher.
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life... that could be destroyed by an insensitive trigger.
and michael started getting to know his son's vice teacher.
that's the "rrrr" side.
you know, it's very annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr daniels' stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you laughed.
"rrrr!" - "rrrrr!"
but, you know, ... ... ... ... ...
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite you for a drink?
or... or...
yes, he's dead
well, i think that mr. daniels' stroke of the stroke...
let's go have a drink.
maybe it will help.
george sr was dealing with his own admirer.
i've already told you so many sins.
maybe you can tell me a few sins.
well, there are legal indicatives to my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me about one of those things that happened... at the university dorm again.
and what's his date with miss bayerly today's second date...
michael, this little korean came, and i don't know what to do with him.
at least, i think it's him.
to tell you for certain, you have to rob him to the underwear
yes, mother.
they'll take him back.
don't take off your shoes, little gentleman!
don't take off your shoes!
it's out of
who is it?
this "annong," your father and i have adopted.
what, i'm leaving for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille noticed the buster was worried, even jealous.
and he knew what it felt like to be ignored.
annyong is your brother's your brother
abort.
he's stay
listen, i'll call you back.
nice driving.
are you making dinner reservations?
it was a little korean.
and after the meetings...
michael took a step he hadn't taken in
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
very good idea.
but how are we gonna sneak in without waking everyone up
this might not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but apparently we're even now.
you took someone i love.
so i took someone you loved.
i'm "nashbagerajam"...."
listen, i know you're trying to get back at me for the marta thing.
i was lying to you when i said i wouldn't try to sleep him, so...
he needs to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i really had a chance to get rid of him.
no problem.
so romantic.
who's "n bahn-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but first i don't know if it's real.
but now... your moral teacher...
yeah, i did that for her.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm sure you're interested in her.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
about his lesson?
i mean, she loves him... that he loves
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with him.
and why did he do that?
why did he sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new... new...
he's not one of the good shooters that targeted him, and he's about to shoot everywhere
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, you think he's old for you, don't you think he's old
we don't even know how old he is.
nobody knows.
she was accompanying young girls at different dances... and i thought i'd go up to her side of the joke, do something...
"hey, you want to dance?"
and i thought, "oh, what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it different in front of the mirror, but
but, you know, um, we've been dancing with a joke or something.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should date someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i figured out a book that was hard to find a picture in the bathroom suite of saddamy.
what did sadadam do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's the same as our fire escape.
in prison, george sr was preparing for an evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon makes his preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael, while he's still angry with gob, he's looking for a family specialist to create trouble.
i know you went out with shannon.
with that cheerleader?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid,
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and i asked him... but he was breathing and he dropped the phone.
i haven't heard back.
you know, maybe we should both go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hello.
mom took him.
do's making me record it at school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss george michael's condition with mrs. bearly.
i'm sorry.
hey.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
i want to talk to you about it.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality... about mor
you see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's like in love with you, so...
he knows we're dating.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most contemptible thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been a moral teacher half a semester
look, it was a preemptive move.
my brother was trying to sleep with you.
then i want to leave you right now and i'm not coming back to you.
i see.
starting now.
george sr. went for a walk with cindi.
george.
and he got to know her.
you can totally pour your heart out here.
it weighs upon my soul
you, you...
he's picking up the camera
so this is your dinner, so it's away with mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy
watch your back, my little immigration brother!
and the different spring dance was in the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting him in because he doesn't have a strong square jaw with your perfectly-shaped nose and round eyes.
you wanna dance?
all right!
he finally found the shannon he was looking for...
he learned that gob cheated on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
sorry.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i ruined our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about this for a while, and-and...
you mean this is the right thing to do.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, my vice teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my vice teacher.
i'm really moved by you trying to protect me after i treated you so badly.
in fact, gob mistook michael's ethics teacher with domestic studies.
man, he... he knows.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a domestic teacher.
second position.
i was seeing miss baerly, and i shouldn't have dragged gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never wanted to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed about some sad things, but...
i don't think we have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm taking this cake.
hey, you wanna dance?
i can't believe this is working.
on the next arrested development.
buster's sweat gets heated.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
no candles allowed here.
mom goes crazy.
no, it's okay.
i burn my own candle.
yeah, that's what i'm gonna do
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
no problem.
right here, let me help you.
these too?
okay, here, let me carry it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is something really extreme.
too much.
come on!
come on!
ok!
ok!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die
we'll all go someday, won't we?
four months ago, each of you joined a interviews to join a show that had never been done.
and guess what?
you win.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm totally gay, and i'm proud of
you're sweet, aren't you
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel, from england.
me too.
that's my brother stanton; my probation officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him in the head.
he doesn't know
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they look like barack obama these days.
each one of you will make $00,000, all you have to do is spend a night in this prison.
abandoned prison.
wow!
fuck!
cool.
how come i never heard this show?
how do we know if this is a prank?
right.
this is our third show, but we're not gonna run it until the fall.
to see if this is a prank or not, you're gonna have to play and earn the money.
you will be asked to perform a series of tasks.
the missions will force your borders, your courage and your thinking.
sounds like fun, doesn't it?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i didn't even have a girlfriend to admit it when he was
i need to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
around.
you'll notice.
the money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if you all make it through the night, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can give me a night here.
anyone else want to join him?
not me.
there's no way i'm going to the city with this
i'm in
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him
bye.
you guys are idiots.
it's a bloody party joke, you're all gonna get high.
you're nothing but a bunch of idiots.
don't you see this recording party?
or become famous.
there's a human head in there!
don't worry, it's not
looks pretty real to me.
that's why they call it "special effects."
lovely, isn't it
a little sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thank you for our special effects team.
follow me, my friends.
in hot swamp water, lazy crocodiles await their prey.
the indian crocodiles are tall and slim-faced
this kind of crocodile...
guys.
i see you work hard as usual.
are we ready?
we're totally
and absolutely.
keep it that way.
yes, sir.
hey.
great job scaring them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are gonna be in the show
you really looked like you were compromised.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really gives me the creeps when
did you know that?
the homeless who died?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
probably a big coincidence.
do you really think it's safe there?
safe enough to get the show insured.
any more questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're recording.
each one of you was chosen by your own free will to spend the night in jail to win $00,000 a head.
clear enough, isn't it?
all right, let's get the party started.
you can find everything you need at your base camp, that's the principal's office.
where?
it's compl
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you took everything we had, how can we write it?
go down the hall, turn right, right again, then left.
straight to the stairs, left, right, and another left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
there you will find a key to escape your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought leaving the basement was terrible.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to the mission.
can you not do that?
i can't see a damn thing in here
does anyone remember where we're going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, two right, then left.
too much straight.
no, straight down the hallway down the hall, straight
"turn around, do it right again, and left.
"then straight to the stairs stairs,
"sola, right, and left again".
what are you?
smart.
illet, this is gonna be a great show
careful.
careful.
oh, god.
what is this place?
and get ready.
it was fun.
let's give them some speed.
yes, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't
the power's running, the generator should have kicked in already.
shit!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here
it's freezing in here
look, key.
yeah.
okay.
look, guys.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think it's the ward
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what's up, man?
"hi brave contestants.
"welcome to warden clem harvis' office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room
these chess rocks will determine your personal role.
"you cannot exchange your balls with other contestants.
"the rags were his favorite".
"now it's your turn to put your hand in the box."
shit.
well, who wants to go first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't
what do you mean you don't know
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black rook.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
fuck!
that was really crazy.
my little piggies, welcome to the mission.
now let me tell you about the pennyville state prison.
in 0000, when the crisis was increased, the brutal warden decided to destroy certain expenses and raise his fortune.
they were prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the warden was exposed.
the last person to be sentenced to death here was warden harvis himself.
rumor has it the warden's still roaming the halls.
you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured souls at this building tonight.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
anybody want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the prison chapel to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first hallway.
the sound is awesome.
thank you.
shit!
what happened?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, relax, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung babies!
their children... their
i think it's all covered with speakerphone.
voices are more effective than images to trigger our fears.
is that right?
okay.
oh, god!
sounds lovely.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't
something came up.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're making noise from the speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flashlight.
okay now?
open the bible's marked page...
"where you will find god's prayer.
"00 years ago, the sacred place was disrespected 00 years ago,,
"now this is the chamber of unusual events."
oh, that's the opposite.
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit
i can't do
"when you complete your mission...
"if a sign doesn't come from the principal,
you can go back to camp".
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry, whoever i'm bothering
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
" save us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"don't let evil rule us.
"protection us from overstepping...
"give us our debts, as we forgive those who owe us.
"and give us our daily bread today.
"as heavenly in heaven...
"like in the sky,
"because dominance and dominance are yours."
please tell me i can go now.
"before we hit camp"...
jesus, randall, you should blow out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look what they do for money.
where'd he go?
from what i understand, the people who did this job have cut off our contact with our homo friend for a little while to give it a more creepy weather.
whatever.
definitely, it's gone pretty smooth
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, man, it's not that bad.
definitely not worth the money.
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it
they can give you another assignment.
don't joke
i swear you don't even know how you feel in there.
it's like walking through thick fog, just cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next.
what do you mean?
some cameras aren't working?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complex.
let's get sczi to go down and have a look, you'll have it.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go downstairs and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy
either we talk or i go.
it's important to me too, taylor
what do you mean?
i did a little research.
are you talking about the town girls you've been sleeping with?
am i right?
big lips, broad hips, taylor.
okay, so the prison wasn't just for
is there a women's department?
and that fucking crazy warden walked around the women's section naked, never answered anyone.
he would beat them, rape them, get pregnant, and starve them to death.
some people say they feed their own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this real story will improve the show!
anyone could be talking about us.
that's nothing compared to the fact that you invented the story.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do that, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
yeah?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they do.
good.
sczi, what is that?
just a little something to help me take off the night.
want some?
get your hairy ass over here, okay?
aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the hell out of me.
i got a great stuff.
suit yourself.
we're all ready to begin.
i can tell you my biggest fear is to be buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will take you to freedom of freedom."
okay,
at the end of liberty.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
fuck!
what?
blood.
it's not real
no cursing, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs aren't down, you're up.
i'm sorry
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you go down, you'll see a door with a finger
he says... he says
shit!
"welcome to cell number five.
" considering the violent and insanity and insanity,
shit.
tell me what to do... so i can get out of this hell.
no!
thank you.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a convict can commit suicide if he can't,
"now you shall live punishment for a prisoner."
okay, where's the
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult task.
"what will you do when you enter the half".
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my duty.
connie.
what?
check this out.
what?
can't...
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back, and i specifically told you... you added a show, and you're asking me why you were fired?
this isn't our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't
don't look at me.
look, connie, you have to get that guy out, okay?
he's gonna screw
shit!
we'll be ruined.
you didn't bring this there?
cut it out, no.
very clear.
what's clear?
approach.
i asked you why you were putting cameras in the control room.
yeah.
behind the surveillance footage... they want to record... the
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
it's brilliant, is
absolutely brilliant.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to record how scared you put something on the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black king and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you could be reassigned.
smartass.
okay, black king and white horse turning right and heading to the gas chamber.
the white queen and black horse are running straight, and they're going to the prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"king and horse go left and then right.
"rook and the horse go all the way down the hallway,
"and go down the stairs".
sczi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
sczi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, open it.
we're in.
"welcome to the pack room.
there must be a light on the wall behind you, open it.
"black king and white knight entering the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
it deserves the best, it's the whole place.
it's the only place the legal department cle
isn't it beautiful?
pretty scary.
oh, god.
what's that smell?
documented facts of death often carry their own smell of death.
of course the smell isn't your death
if a man knows his life is coming to the end of his life, his concern is caused by the release of matter which gives him plenty of smells.
in that case, what we're worried about is the smell of human smell and the gas that killed him.
it's fun time, ladies and gent
the black hawk is sitting in the chair.
black king?
this is me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you will find some meat and a panic.
you'll cook this meat and eat it.
man!
prisoners always eat meat's flesh cows, pig...
"or because there's no lamb or some other meat...
"that he was suspected.
they thought it was a nice meat they'd never tasted before.
you mean human flesh, don't you?
are you in there?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i gave up.
you'll get toni on the phone.
i'm giving it to you, toni should totally live the fear of the prisoners just before the gas is given.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends have some weird demands.
are you okay?
okay.
"your mission's gas teammate...
to find the main van without killing and cut the gas."
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to puke.
okay.
weird.
i can't do
i can't
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
"no more pranks."
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they'll pay extra money".
do it for the team, girl.
are you gonna throw up?
thank you.
okay, angel, i'm at the bottom of the stairs.
shit!
can you hear me?
he's back
it really stinks.
let me out.
come on.
let me out, man.
oh, god!
who's the guy standing there?
topless.
muscular.
let me out.
i don't know, con. this guy is starting to creep
stop playing games.
let me out.
how's it going
we need to talk to you.
outside?

they closed everything.
it's over
the bbc can confirm that the american terrorist leader adem qasim has escaped from mi0 custody in one of the most serious failures in the event history of
the security convoy transporting qasim seems to have been attacked at raf northolt.
you say it's not war but murder because it's on the west
because in new york, in washington, you didn't want that in london.
but the children of pakistan didn't either.
when they get hit by drone airplanes, they call it murder.
qasim offers a new kind of threat.
so far, he hasn't targeted civil
our models show a 00% chance of an attack within 00 hours.
the more pressure he gets, the smaller the window becomes.
i can't say that under the tape recording...
the secretary of state is coming tomorrow
we serve the british people, not washington.
if that isn't true anymore, we're already
americans think we don't serve purpose anymore.
we need a head.
i'll be relieved of duty
did you hear about qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, what's gonna happen to me
you're out too.
no one else knows you're in qasim's network
just go.
will holloway?
go.
how's life after mi0?
you're not from the moscow section.
london needs you.
is there anyone you should say goodbye to?
thank you.
we know harry's contact with your family, so we understand that this may not be easy for you.
even if he's dead, it'
harry's too arrogant to kill himself.
he was pretending to kill himself.
he went to this woman's grave
the love of your life
harry's team has noticed changes in harry's attitude since she died.
he's become emotionally distant, cold, he's started drinking
water would be below 0 degrees.
he'd have hypothermic me before he got to the bank
this is the picture before you entered the square, and this is the one you said you were taken after you jum
before she disappeared, harry made three encrypted phone calls.
your old emergency message box.
why did he call you?
i have no idea.
the last time i spoke to him was the night he pulled me out of mi0 0 years
he wants to talk right now.
that makes you useful.
can you help us find him?
no, thanks.
and you, harry, do you talk much about berlin?
the night your father died?
if there's anything else, mace, i have a right to know.
i don't think i can decide that...
if you weren't really gonna kill her, i think you told me what you wanted
find harry, so you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
i thought i was taking this title to the grave.
the anti-terrorist president lately for his majesty's security services.
funny, but who are you really?
someone who knows what these two words mean to you.
asma shishani.
go.
how did you find me?
what do you want?
i know it was someone on my side.
they never told me who they were.
of course they didn't, but you must have a connection.
it's a phone number, that's
the phone number will work.
in return, i'll give you what you want.
impossible.
he said he was a human rights lawyer.
your government helped them after putting two brothers in prison.
but after i was released, she became too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if he's an agent, he's not one
then don't worry, tell me again it doesn't mean anything to you.
keep her alive, she's guaranteed i'll keep my word.
i don't need guarantees.
take him to a hospital now or the deal is off!
what she needs is mercy.
no!
she's got a
and you sent him after me?
you put him in danger and now you refuse to save him from pain?
how the fuck are you?
don't send a video to his family.
harry... harry
you have a deal.
according to the bbc, the fugitive terrorist is no improvement on adam qasim's capture.
the national threat level has been compromised, so eli has an attack on his ear.
in economy news, the ftse 000 fell again this morning and sterling continued to breathe the dollar, the euros and other funds.
there's a new intel on harry.
he got a prepaid line we tracked down to kent coast.
holloway, this is classified.
we found traces of explosive there.
you've known him longer than any of us.
do you think it's possible that qasim might have got harry involved somehow?
pulling him over?
i don't
anyway, you find harry, we find qasim.
anything for holloway?
here you go.
tomorrow, 00.
salpa 0, show a, park at bay 0.
then, open your eyes.
i hope you come alone.
just for protection.
we're seriously in trouble if you can't get a crazy cold war morgue to hit.
i promise.
it doesn't say yet.
we play this through harry's way until we see him.
copy that.
doors opening.
go.
ground floor.
doors opening.
open sightings, multiple exits.
repeat, holloway.
things harry needs to set up a meeting.
yes, mr. holloway, your uncle said he'd meet you at the coffee shop.
she left her cell phone at home.
the guy in the parking lot, get rid of him
she'd have to wear a mi0 shirt.
listen to me.
stop underestimating harry.
don't think he won't put your men in danger.
wait for him to send a signal...
what is it, alpha 0?
holloway?
holloway, where are you going?
wait.
no, we don't have a system there
don't move.
holloway, freeze!
terminal 0b.
doors closing.
he got me a flight.
pa000, the glasgow plane.
i'm going to dallasow.
search the glenow office.
get me the airport police.
priority code number nine.
the police want a clear path to the terminal.
and get us permission to secure heathrow.
the passengers from the flight of pa000, willigow flight...
holloway, don't get into the air section
what am i doing here, harry?
i had to find someone outside the service i can trust.
it's a short list when you're drunk, crazy and dead.
to be honest, the only person i can call friend is someone who thinks i ruined his life.
qasim's escape was arranged by someone on the top of the service.
by one of the people who asked you to follow me.
that's why i needed to disappear.
qasim had it.
he's our only connection to the traitor
once he's in the system, he'll be
he's planning an attack.
someone's trying to destroy the service itself.
you're crazy.
ruth's death... ruth's
don't
look for yourself, that's all i want.
what are you waiting for, harry?
mi0 was my everything, and you took it from me, and for nothing.
hate me all you want, but i think you believe in the service.
what happened in berlin?
they tricked you like that?
this may not end as you hoped.
i'm afraid i have to tell them there's something in the lining of your jack
nothing there, but they'll have to check it out.
i'll send you a number.
call me in 00 hours, please.
i'm security services.
put your hands behind your back!
you just let him go.
relax, francis.
we don't want you to have a heart
the deadly one.
mi0 seems completely responsible right now, and i'm the last friend in the government of mi0.
so you're really gonna have to be nice to
in other words, is he crazy?
this isn't contradicting her last three psychological
she refused to attend.
harry pearce hasn't stopped being.
no matter how crazy he is, i still catch him...
for instance.
she asked me to help her disappear.
you didn't think to accept your request and bring it to us?
just because your life hasn't been worth a damn since harry dropped you off doesn't mean we can't put your life in a more shitty position right
since we threatened each other, you three shouldn't be caught in the blood that you weren't hanging on a cliff.
your entire organization seems to be disposable right now.
find qasim.
fully loaded.
they're ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i saw this name working on a case.
i thought they relieved you of duty.
they did.
now, what really happened?
the abduction may have been arranged by someone in the service.
do you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i left it two weeks ago.
there must be one around here.
tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't.
when i was 00, i was hanging out with a kid who had money transfers.
k was interested in some people using it, so they came to me.
you started as an agent?
and when i was done, they asked me to train as an officer.
my parents came back to me when i told them.
and if someone you work with helped qasim escape, that would be a problem, right?
all right.
something felt wrong that day.
rob vass, my team leader, was in the front vehicle with me.
he told me not to open the weapons compartment.
he ordered me to chase him.
where does he live?
it's
w00.
panama city.
service bribe fund.
june, what are you... what are you
who are you?
you told me not to chase qasim.
you told me not to chase after my gun.
we swore an oath, rob.
i'm not saying anything until we get to thames house.
we're not going to thames house.
will, what did you find?
qasim's guards are deliberately weakened.
the team leader was involved.
he's just a sho
find out who gave the order.
the americans think mi0 is the weak link, and i think one of them is joining them.
qasim escaped, we fell out of sight.
the cia got the whole thing.
fire... fire
he was gonna shoot
his pulse... pul
dead, dead.
he's
listen.
you should go home.
june!
i'll take care of this, but you gotta go, now.
i never heard a part of you get killed with that song.
who's warrener hit the eyelash?
landon miller.
agency witness.
he's trying to secure his continued support, hoping not to give the keys to the kingdom.
every time i see you, francis, you look like you've been buried another inch or two inches away from langley or pentagon.
you don't have to tell me
i think in times like these, we should remember whose flag is shaking.
francis.
i'm trying to help, but he's basically accusing me of doing business for the cia
tonight, your generals, your politicians, your spies have come together for a celebration.
tonight, we will strike at the heart of their power.
our enemy, the politicians who send your sons and daughters to die in illegal wars.
spies spying on you like you're criminals.
this war is far beyond religious differences.
all the flights out of the united kingdoms...
he had it.
warrender lived.
if you have a way to get to qasim, say it now.
there's another way.
qasim's wife.
asma shishani.
the fsb has her.
if i find her where they keep her, she'll give the traitor.
you made a deal with him.
yeah.
and if we can, he'll lead us straight to him.
surrender and set it up.
how do you know the russians have her?
in exchange for a cia agent stuck in moscow.
i can reach a distance, but you need to open the secret door.
this is an ip address.
you're kidding.
it's the only way, will
harry's getting help from somewhere.
i got your old contacts, but i need access to personnel files to do it properly.
but it doesn't take you anywhere exciting.
i'm in position.
looks like i'm gonna have to steal more extra bandwidth.
your drink.
malcolm?
all right, i'm in.
i'm looking at the servers now
harry, we gotta go.
can't we do this any faster?
i can do it.
but unfortunately, this machine is from the previous century.
g branch already pulled these.
erin watts.
might be worth a closer look.
fill in the blanks for me.
but i got an agent.
i almost got him out.
i've been in business for less than a year.
or soon they make you choose.
all right, i'll leave you alone.
are we done?
why am i sure?
i'm sorry, will.
harry.
harry!
harry, what have you done?
stay away from the computer.
i didn't feel the need to say this before, but i hope you know what you're doing.
is harry working with qasim?
he stole an entire gchq data archive.
everything we have on our western agents in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
he showed up on the airport cctv at schrefeld.
i don't
harry cyber didn't strike the attack alone.
then who's helping him?
except you.
and you still protect her.
why?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i'll find him.
and there's a threat.
according to the analysis, there will be a large-scale attack within 00 hours, multiple targets.
a operative on qasim's escape is missing.
there are signs of struggle in his house.
do you know anything about that?
how's your mother, holloway?
i hear he's not very good.
he hasn't packed since your father died.
understandable, really.
and then that door comes to work.
i know, i know.
harry was right about one thing.
you're not good enough.
home secretary, can we really hope to stop qasim attacking again?
we've destroyed the threats of our freedom and the way we live.
your ability to wound us may be important, but it's the end of
you'll find out there are no limits to our
they won't listen.
they never killed our women?
we're making the world a better place, brother.
transfer team in position at the airport.
we have authorization by the atc to shut down the prisoner car when necessary.
i think i owe you.
you were absolutely right about vass.
danke.
alexanderplatz.
it's on the northeast corner of the metron, 00rd
we have a safe house.
call it nostalji.
don't forget to bring the archives
don't forget to bring his wife
how did you find me?
there's only one place to meet in berlin.
you told me.
northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
no emotionality.
this is the price of qasim's wife.
when the fsb is out of custody, qasim will give me a number.
he's taking me to the traitor.
they'll destroy the service, where it can be defended.
get in the car, harry.
there's an old hotel about 00 minutes away.
my contact can meet us there with a clean passport.
you're going home.
sorry about that.
why are you here, miss keaton?
keep moving, harry.
i killed someone because of you.
you're c0.
what are you doing, harry?
talent discovery.
and which one of you found it?
jesus christ, will.
preparation is everything.
and vass?
when he came to my house, i reported
i said someone was asking about qasim's escape.
they tied me to the command center and told me what to do.
they went to vass's house before we did, and they planted the evidence.
i set vass to escape.
you think i want to do it?
i know my mission.
i'm the only one who kn
you were set up.
he's right, will.
but i wonder if miss keaton's sure about me.
it was a secure command chain.
what was i supposed to do?
do you believe him?
yeah.
i'm sure your men will come and find you if your usefulness is still valid.
after all this was over, what did you think they were gonna do to you
i did what they asked me to do.
we're changing the deal.
we're taking qasim's wife to london.
tell him to come to the exchange, or he'll never see his wife again.
let's go get her.
what happened to alexanderplatz?
a sudden agoraphobia feeling.
i'm afraid there was a problem with qasim's wife
at least be good enough to put it in my car.
harry.
colonel.
i hate to be unkind, but we're gonna need your clothes.
as the search for adam qasim intensifies, all passengers travelling on the united kingdom's national line will have to show valid id and face bag control.
i have your wife.
let me talk to him.
the russians put him to sleep and...
bullshit.
i'm bringing your wife to london.
no.
i'll tell your whore you said good-bye.
is the baby too much?
no, it's the same you
i trusted june.
you were right to take me off duty.
despite everything i've done, you're still here trying to do something good.
i will not allow your sacrifices to be in vain.
it was here.
was it fast?
he could've let me go, but he chose not to
if you try anything, anything at all, i can't guarantee anyone's safety.
nobody's
you bring my wife, i'll give you your phone number.
here we go.
hello?
holloway.
this message came from h branch.
me.
we can catch qasim, but we need help.
and let's go.
one clean choice, hannah.
trust me, and help me.
or go.
either do well or do well, right?
shit.
they're approaching position.
what i wrote last night is updating itself without stopping the algorithm regenerating, reviewing all potential points of view.
so he's not cutting water?
please.
all right, we're here.
how much time do we have?
i'm looking at 000 cameras.
give me something.
once he realizes we're playing him, he'
wait.
he worked 00 seconds ago.
are you sure?
yes, confirmed.
camera disabled in the last minute.
third roof, east corner.
harry, we have to stall.
i have to hope he's looking right at us.
yeah?
you were told south.
i have his wife.
you were supposed to look south.
give me the number.
give me the number or we'll leave.
turn around now or you die.
here.
him too.
i haven't got it yet.
you have 0 seconds to turn around.
turn.
maybe this guy never saw her.
almost there.
him?
kill him.
give me the number.
don't
stop!
no!
okay?
will, she's fine.
the shooter is dead.
then it's over.
malcolm, feather.
yeah?
my wife is dead, isn't
harry, listen.
let hannah report us.
harry?
hannah, why did harry remove the earphones
i don't
report us.
get sco00 here, now.
rdx loaded four truck, leaving limehouse north industrial park in the next 00 minutes.
how do you know?
qasim just told me.
trucks loaded with bombs in 00 minutes.
i think we got him.
let's go!
armed police!
stay where you are!
clear!
clear!
the main target?
negative!
negative!
negative, sir.
command, area clear.
harry.
he sold his own men.
why would he do that?
what did you do?
armed police!
freeze!
move!
you have to tell them everything, harry.
i think we have a lot to talk about.
this might be a little out of line.
since the southwest corner of alexanderplatz.
keep holloway eye on you.
make sure he's safe.
maybe we won't be so hasty.
did you find qasim?
harry will talk.
you still don't know him.
qasim gave up his entire operation.
what did you say to him?
i should have thought they'd release you after berlin.
they want to offer you a deal.
throw everything on harry and go.
i told them i'd leave it after i did.
there's no way
i can't
you have an emergency backup key wrapped around your neck.
whatever you're up to... wh
what would ruth think?
what did you give him?
check the back.
southwest corner.
i found harry in the northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
the opposite.
where you're gonna trap somebody.
harry?
i gave you to him.
get down!
get down!
get down!
lock us down.
get down!
get down!
we're not here for you!
we came for them.
get down!
think of your families.
hamza.
why?
there are 00 men on the other side of these doors.
you must surrender.
come here.
open up!
if you think we're gonna negotiate...
open the door.
but he'll kill us.
there are too many demons in a room.
the only way out of here alive is to surrender...
you think i want to get out?
how many people's lives start to end in this room
the lives of my people.
your people?
no one asked you to speak for them, to kill for them.
if you want a hostage...
i think he made it clear he wasn't interested in
i'm the director general of mi0.
kill me and put the gun down.
otherwise, you're nothing but a dead terrorist.
no one will see you as a hero.
when we're done, you're gonna be a drunken, impotent heathead who beats his wife.
we'll drive up a few marrakech boys' whores and give them free tickets to disneyland in return for saying you begged them to piss on you.
we can't remember you very well, can we, adam?
wait, wait, wait.
i pulled the helicopter back.
but... but
you fucking coward.
i thought you were fighting a higher standard.
i'm sorry about your wife's death, adam
i know what this can do to you.
is that supposed to stop me?
it's
stop!
why did you bring him here?
i made a choice.
without a plan b.
why do you think i keep you out of your room?
people are still dead, harry.
less than the ones who will die in the explosions.
what choice do you make?
this is my job.
auntie, can you come outside and play?
hello, geraldine.
finally, it comes down to who tells the longest lie.
right?
if we had protected that morning, qasim would never have escaped.
you gave met's air unit an order to reverse all mi0 requests, didn't you?
that's the advantage of being a lone maniac.
i don't need to prove it
sacrificing his own fortune so he can be absorbed by a foreign power.
americans would have made you director general, no doubt.
how many more lives was that promotion worth?
what did you think you made, harry?
the service is dying
but if i'd given up the moment i realized i was on the losing side, my career would be too
blowing my brains out, finding my 00-year-old niece...
i think it came from you.
what is this?
the thin gut goes crazier than 0 hours or leads to unstoppable bleeding.
leaves no trace.
how clever.
i was afraid that would be your answer.
so i took your chance to choose.
it's not lunch that makes you sick.
i ate a cattle rib.
tell me you lied, harry.
please.
tell me you didn't betray your country.
it's been 0 hours, geraldine.
you can spend the last three hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you i'd go out and play with your beautiful niece
i'm thinking.
your message said you'd tell me something.
they're spying on ruth's grave.
you can't leave now.
i have something that should be yours, actually.
your father was wearing this the night he died.
the stasi removed everything that could work and found a way to get into your body and the fsb archives.
he was wearing a wedding ring on the night of his operation?
i didn't kick you out of your assignment because you weren
after your dad, i couldn't...
i should have protected you.
the good don't last forever, will.
then who does?
they're like me
it would help if you knew your problem and told the men at the door.
hotel middle school has room for every guest.
single file.
these new problems are killing in the dark.
these people will be grateful when the darkness falls.
i think we should keep them here to keep them safe, but i'm worried things are getting worse.
they have no idea who caused the darkness.
besides, what we have to worry about isn't hiding in the
we still haven't figured out how to get that fog wall up
maybe it's a blessing.
this was the latest from in-flight safety.
i'm on your side and i might need a new job.
it's under my control, but if i can get another pillow for my beauty sleep, it'll be fine.
try to fix things.
we talked about this.
it's almost impossible to eliminate a person's problem without killing him.
of course, i just need information that's impossible to provide tools that i don't have, and maybe not.
i'm gonna need a team
do you have any idea what's going on?
but there's a bad element.
it's the only way to protect the rest of us
it's risky driving because of the magnet problem.
an engineer to help fix the power plant.
he volunteered as soon as he knew.
if things don't work out, you can use his problem for the operator.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
the untraceable killer is out there somewhere.
and i think he really wants to prove to you that he wants to help.
okay, well, whatever the reason, look after her for me, okay?
because neither of us is immune to new problems.
i'm not saying it's just my
i'll call the person who caused the darkness trouble when you're gone.
he stole those batteries and endangered us.
there was no choice, dwight.
this is the third case in two weeks.
now the serial killer is in this building.
okay, i'm gonna go talk to dwight.
my father always said you were a good man.
mara's father?
there may be a way, but if you want me to explain it, it may seem more frightening, so
even on the map, i can't find maine, haven.
are you telling me you can't find a town with 00,000 population?
that didn't cause problems.
then why didn't we use aether in the first place to end the troubles?
i can't bring them when they're sealed.
so how do we find it?
gloria brought a box of stuff that duke left on gull.
i don't think william has the amount i need, and aher is just the first phase.
you told his wife you'd find him.
it's easy to make a decision on the side, but sometimes things
i have a town to protect.
no wonder the plant is working at 00%.
guys, i'll try, but remember, i've never done anything like this before.
they parked the car so i could talk to you, but i don't have enough money to pay for the oil change.
if everything goes well, i'll be back with aether before sunset.
this is peggy's husband, rolf.
enough panic and fear.
the same killer who killed my son 00 years ago?
we call him the murderer who won't leave a trace.
what else are you hiding from me, vince?
dwight's doing everything he can to make the rules accept, but he's not the guy to kill people.
in this haven, banishment is the same as execution.
thanks to our friend there, we keep them in some kind of prison.
he says the generator works at 00%.
shit, when the generator overloaded, the energy reserves must have emptied.
well, that explains the power to the town.
at this rate, about five minutes.
it's almost over, and it's the only thing that protects us from dying
here, i reconfigured the generator settings to get power to the town faster, but there's nothing else we can do.
they better get back.
help each other.
turn the lamps around.
share your supplies.
you see, i'm happy here.
i got your message.
get in the car now.
come on, jump!
if war lies ahead, we should be thankful, even slean.
i don't think you have anything worse than falling in love.
i don't like it here.
there are two sides to every story.
whoever's behind this is a traitor.
let's go.
he asked me to represent him at slean's wedding.
palace, you are my brother's love.
that's why you're my brother.
you've seen bigger places in the iraq realms than here.
none of them were ruled by a woman.
you should choose a second to accompany you and watch your interests during the ritual.
then you will hear the bonds of your friends and relatives.
i have no relatives here.
my mother and the others will join you.
kela, this is the palace from bregan.
rheda, must you always be guarding me?
i don't really get it.
but i know i should marry slean.
i'll love her.
this marriage cannot happen.
abrecan trusts you.
what do you do?
carpenter.
they can use you on the wall then.
who are you?
a friend of the chairman.
like i said, i have work to attend to.
we need to think how to handle it.
varr said i couldn't accept gifts.
between you and me, then.
every bride ought to smell good when the wedding
remember, it's our secret.
sit down.
we'll take what we'll get when they look at the wounded.
you wanted to talk?
all right.
kela, it's time for your ritual.
elvina, will you be the second person i have?
for the game.
we need to talk sometime.
we need to discuss why the marriage shouldn't work.
if we don't fulfil our mission, their marriage may be
beowulf!
let's celebrate.
by old traditions!
the dress smells skewers.
i'm so sorry.
it was just a little mistake.
that's it
we're gonna help slean give the symbol to his bride.
sounds easy.
breca!
open the door!
come on, you stinking mudborn.
come on!
come on!
give me your arm.
come on!
slean.
be quiet, the bald sleeps.
are they ready for this marriage?
i don't understand why slean didn't want to marry kela.
i don't think so.
he should put his feelings aside and do what's best for everyone.
would you put aside what you wanted for others?
that's what we all have to do.
if someone spends their whole life pleasing others, then that person doesn't actually live.
it must make you feel pretty free to think that way.
try it.
tell every rock the truth.
but then you can look at each other and light the fire that symbolizes your marriage.
then you'll be husband and wife.
have you loved someone before?
no.
before you came here... you...
do you want to be thane?
tell my uncle i'm done with him.
go.
come on!
go on!
you let him go.
we're not done here.
don't you understand?
i betrayed my mother and set up a plot with my uncle.
this woman was sent here to kill you!
i don't
was it?
i killed my brother.
he was the one who was supposed to be with
even if the world were destroyed, mara had everything.
people loved him because he was kind.
my father loved him because he was his first child.
rowan and lovers.
and then i had the opportunity to escape.
i didn't need anything.
she died of humor.
he was recovering.
i poisoned him.
slean, i won't tell anyone what you're doing here today and what's
or stay.
i know, but he's beowulf's.
he went to bed the other night.
but we can choose who we can draw our destiny with.
light with me.
you want to be thane?
i can help you.
against those who oppose you.
they can't take it from you anymore, rheda.
with this marriage you're jarl of shieldlands.
these rules of jarl must be used by any tribe.
if the blood isn't paid, a killer's life will be
the thieves will be branded and cast out of society.
all the cost of trade in shieldlands will be determined by jarl.
what right does he have to identify the price of fish?
we're the ones risking their lives to catch the pandiri every summer.
you should have told me about these rules.
you were where your people needed you the most, on guard.
i couldn't distract you
it was messy enough.
you're late for pandiri.
some think you missed him again.
but if you fail, bregan will be miserable and open the winter.
breca's wanted for murder, you know it.
kill him!
kill breca now!
i got it!
do it without any explanation, and we're all dead.
after he escaped the gallows, he hired us to bring breca to the law.
we wanted to ask the guy who helped him escape the first time?
that's why we'll welcome this.
but we have to keep the breca.
as we speak, herot can stand our gates!
when do we kill young women sometimes?
what do you mean?
you've been hiding in the shadows for too long, ab
don't forget who you're talking
talk.
he wants breca's life or blood money for his brother's murder.
i didn't mean to kill anyone.
hurry!
thank you.
breca loved my mom.
he's looking for the kinds he thinks he's got, and then he's stealing the money and running, this
she left my mother and took everything of value with her.
my brother came after him.
but it cost him his life.
breca, is it true?
i'll pay for your brother's blood.
lila, do you have 00 silver coins?
i don't want money, i want blood
silence!
if the blood is paid, breca will be released.
you lied to me.
pandiri.
pandiri!
fasten it.
get ready, they're coming.
i saw it.
get out!
the council is assembled
he's willing to take my place because i lost the antidote.
you let me down, slean married keela, rheda became jarl!
you don't understand
tell the council our enemies are gathering, that your sister cannot rule, that you want to save shieldlands.
so tell me you're distracted.
tell me.
i'm sorry
i knew breca killed someone, but the story he told me was different.
it's only his fault.
lila, nobody thinks bad things about you...
that's all i got.
did you bring it?
there aren't 00 silver
not enough.
i'll hold breca while i see that job.
was there enough money?
lila?
turn it off, beowulf, please.
you won't talk to lila.
get on your horse, leave heroot and never come back.
there's no room for you here any
if herot's being attacked, i want to fight properly.
if herot's attacked, i'll protect you.
let's try.
it's not about mudborn.
i don't want to talk about him
i want to know why you lied about training me.
it's wasted on you.
you don't even want to be one.
yeah?
i didn't know we trained the blacksmiths!
go.
now!
he fights girls now?
the landscape was more like he was training the blacksmith.
i know you think i let you down.
that i can't focus on my duties in bregan.
but i have my reasons.
you're talking about treason against your own blood.
this land needs a warrior!
someone to bring their people out of the darkness.
a man in power who will take control!
you're talking about betraying your sister to hide the fact that you can't afford your people.
what's the point of having fish if we're all going to be slaughtered
i'm here to vote insecurity for our thane.
those against abrecan being thane.
the verdict
a new thane will be appointed and announced in the morning.
get up.
next.
nobody.
don't think this is a game
we're lazy, distracted.
this will work here.
from now on, we'll work like my father hrothgar.
i didn't mean to interrupt
you're a good teacher.
a great thane needs a strong army behind him.
we don't have to share the same bed, but if we don't share the same room, people will
i always liked watching herot from here.
it looks so invincible.
if i tell my mother the truth, i'll lose her trust.
and a chance to rule one day.
what if abrecan attacks?
herot could fall.
no advice?
i trust you.
your decision will be right.
i'll be there when you do.
you'll be thane.
you just have to believe it.
pandiri.
pandiri!
it's the pandir
sound the horn!
i order you, play the horn!
abrecan, give it up.
if we don't act now, we'll get the opportunity
why... why
you, help me with the net.
help me with the net now.
why don't you help me?
pandiri!
come on, hurry up!
go find me a sack.
people shouldn't leave their valuables anywhere.
you owe my mom an apology.
but i'm a warrior and honor is at stake.
so i'll take your life.
go back to mommy, little girl.
greetings.
i didn't need your help.
because he didn't have enough money to save you.
be thankful you didn't kill him, vishka
if we don't plant the nets, our prey will be
no, he won't.
get ready.
abrecan, no!
hold the rope still!
hurry, they'll eat you alive!
pandiri, pandiri!
pandiri, pandiri!
hold on!
now get back!
check it out.
there will be songs about this hunt.
a prey you won.
i have a dream about us.
being the biggest tribe in the shieldlands!
we're not going to follow the laws a jarl can't even keep a sword.
who's with me?
abrecan, abrecan, abrecan!
i have to warn beowf.
bregan!
elvina!
the warriors are coming together.
they intend to destroy us this time.
beowulf!
if we look around today, we'll see more danger and harm come from religious beliefs.
my wife would be less embarrassed if i talked about the soviet communism or the atrocities of stalin.
it's the status of the philosophy of questioning things that make trouble for people, especially the situation.
presenting a situation that is perfectly true in itself can cause serious damage.
when the prophecy doesn't happen, we make fun of those people and the whole world makes fun of us.
i had a friendly disposition with richard dawkins.
maybe we should be more aggressive with richard.
especially america is surrounded by christian faith.
they're sure the world is what their religion says it is.
we'll get rid of the bad gu
i'd like to write a book like that, if i could.
but of course one of my fears is what happens next.
what kind of chaos?
how true would it be to do that to people who think religion can protect us from civilization and good in ours?
religion is like moral viagra for many people.
if that's true, if the religion does guide people to moral lives, then anybody's gonna take a serious leap of our own and turn the bottom line.
because there may be lots of people left down there and we can create a chaos out of these people's fear.
a lot of people want their lives to mean something, and where does that come from?
but there must be something better than religion.
yeah, there's definitely hope.
let's see what happens.
of course.
at least you didn't get a piercings.
i don't know how to explain this to amy.
i'm the dumbest man in
all right, stop it.
i'm the dumbest man in
okay, you win this.
i can't find emma's papers.
honey, just so you know, you can't return the baby if you find the original receipt.
i need to find the paper angela signed when she left emma on my doorstep and gave me the only regent he gave me.
i'm finally getting health insurance for what i am responsible for myself and care.
i haven't talked to her since the night we made emma.
calm down.
you gave me all the important paperwork on the baby to keep them safe.
do you have all the papers?
his father's little girl is his father'
maybe something with a balloon.
it looks good!
you robbed a clown?
it's your birthday!
my first birthday is tomorrow.
you used to party all the time when you
celebrating my birthday... after that...
"happy birthday miley." "
you know those papers i kept for me?
how irresponsible do you think i am?
but i... but
i may have mailed them in on time, but she didn't mail them, and i might be the only one with emma's attorney.
we were all excited because the new baby came and i didn't have a stamp!
look, if we get angela to sign this document again, we'll be fine.
since you're the best friend of ben's and you're the only one who's seen
i like it very much, all right.
all right, emma's finally asleep
hey, danny, what's the reason riley doesn't want to celebrate her birthday?
why does he really hate it so much?
ben riley didn't celebrate her birthday after her 00 years of disaster.
are you sure you want to watch this?
i think i'd remember if it was a disaster.
all right, come on, everybody.
danny, where are we going?
fortunately for the future that you won a real mustache and lost one kilo of personality.
me here too?
benjamin wheeler, come here and celebrate riley's birthday.
well, i can tell you this is my best birthday ever.
tell me you didn't do anything to the cake.
actually, try to save it with a perm first and then cut it out.
is riley still in love with ben or is that something that happened when he was a kid?
unless you still love riley.
i ruined the girl's sweet 00.
it's not on birthdays, but the rest of the time he loves
if ben is so irresponsible that he lost the papers and too scared to face me, maybe he doesn't deserve to take emma's attorney alone.
if it makes you feel better, we do most of the work.
i can imagine how hard it is to leave emma.
i knew how beautiful, funny or amazing you'd end up hurting her!
in your presence on the streets of the city, the elite u.s. military unit of the u.s. military unit, slave trooper,
also known as the madox-00, the limited combat capability in the area is quite high.
what's more, he's got more damage powers than a uh-00 blackhawk.
it's perfect for anti-terrorist and anti-gerilla operations.
miss kusumoto is also the chief architect of the software for "tankbuster."
in order to reveal madox's abilities with his disposal, the pilot himself passed into the cabin today.
unit 0 will go to ichigaya tonight.
we're in a hurry, so try to be as fast as you can.
and...
mrs. kusumoto, you've made me quite embarrass
i'm not here for congratulations
i have one thing to say to you:
wow!
kouji... k
what is it?
onose, leave this to me!
they just threw away their trash.
i'm telling you, don't worry
i'll buy you dinner in return, won't i?
sdf's transport vehicle...
according to the reports, it was natural to encounter this case...
obviously terrorist work.
you're a lot of strangers in the eastern bloc operation.
i hope you know what you're saying!
i hope you see the burden of the accident is entirely yours.
either way, the situation we're in is critical.
we were transferring him to the field test!
it's fuck
i have to make the operation.
besides, the madox-00 is being overdone right now.
we're having trouble searching the crime scene.
do you think we should get some backup from the police on the phone
we must prepare ourselves for the worst, and keep the help corps ready.
i'm the only one who can go up against the madox and get high.
although lieutenant kilgore is one of the most troubles in the army, he is our best tanker in the army.
is this-- is this okay?
nobody's in the building?
anyway, i'm a little relieved.
shiori was a really pretty girl...
when he goes to study in england, all the boys in japan will mourn.
how did you know that?
he called me in the morning and asked me to give you a message.
use the open switch to open it.
it burns!
the pilot could be adjusted.
she feels like she's wearing boots for skiing.
we've received the activation signal from the madox.
this is a disaster.
could you heat it up in the microwave?
i really fucked up!
shiori, what do you intend to do
defense forces?
you're going out with the prototype airborne tank.
don't you dare turn tokyo into vietnam!
tokyo or vietnam, for me all wars are the same.
you'll be catastrophic.
oh, no need to worry.
i'll get over it before it gets too hot.
lieutenant kilgore is using the most advanced tank and anti-tank helicopters i promise him the madox mission.
in this case, there will be great panic downtown.
under the circumstances, there must be someone who can stop kilgore and madox.
what can we do?
we don't know the target of the madox yet.
if i can find him before lieutenant kilgore, then maybe i'm convinced we have a chance.
but the madox is...
i'll use unit 0 with success from power testing.
what are the chances of success
hey, you heard me!
wait for me.
that's it!
how you doing!
what are you doing on the road?
i can't stand by the side of the road like a pavement
you're a real driver, man!
i've got plenty more to finish the install
he's back in the cabrio
bye, assholes!
yeah, the saturdays, shinjuku, the car was closed to traffic.
i can't lose track of this crowd!
this "madox" must be really valuable.
spider 0 to jackal 0.
action on target!
he's acting on his own
one of the apaches was dropped.
all units are authorized by the authority to destroy the madox.
exactly what kilgore wanted.
he's heading to the skyscrapers and skyscrap
the civilians must evacuate immediately!
they're all over me!
i gotta go that way, use the west exit.
another demented lunatic just popped out!
all right, back to work, madox!
i hear you.
and i say, "you're a headache."
if anyone's causing trouble, it's you.
"just" what?
none of your business.
i can't do something i don't know what
oh, no!
yes, captain!
"nsr parking spot --
exit exit exit
i did it!
shiori's upstairs!
i won't let you take another step.
i can't resist!
i can't lose any more time with you!
i thought you were an amateur so i shouldn't be nice to you.
time to stop jumping around.
it's not gon
he's just a kid!
what were you trying to accomplish by doing this?
my name is sugimoto kouji, a sophomore at kanto institute of technology.
my only intention was to meet my girlfriend, waiting for me at the nsr building.
first he locked me in, then he dropped his own helicopter.
i got you.
miss kusumoto, this is spider 0 speaking, kilgore.
really, i saw your show.
you fight pretty hard.
i'll deal with yokota headquarters, personally, whatever it takes.
hey, where are the civilians in the
what's so important?
as you think of me, why am i going crazy?
the target has madox.
he'll come after you to destroy him.
the most i know how to walk and use my hands.
you got it.
either the madox is destroyed, or you kill kilgore!
they damaged my legs.
i can't move anymore
you think i can defeat him?
you were pretty good when we were fighting.
did you read the entire manual?
hey, madox.
adi it!
come and kill me!
couldn't you just resist a little bit more and increase my "pot"?
blan-et!
what happened, you turned like a turtle!
if you can't even do that much you're gonna ruin the name of tankbuster!
your numbers won't work on me!
kouji!
i'm coming
you're brave!
i'm tired of cat-fat!
you fell into my medical trap!
if i fall, i'll take you with me, madox!
it's a mess with madox!
i have something very important to tell you, shiori.
paul wouldn't hurt anyone.
"unimm cannot be" cannot
i'm not your mother, brian.

while you were selling cigarettes or weed, i still looked out for you.

are you the owner of this vehicle?
but you stopped me for nothing.
but before that, let's raise our glasses to the new owner, chester.
chester.
i hope he will shiver upon these magnificent monsters as i have for years.
cheers.
i promise i'll raise the standards of this show and you'll be proud.
have a nice trip to where dreams come true.
thank god.
even if that big-faced german leaves, we'll take charge.
marjorie, that's so shame...
thank you, chester.
now, if you don't mind, let the main family, the community of monsters and bizarreities spend their last moments
bye.
there's someone else to thank.
mr. richard spencer.
our lives have completely changed their course.
cheers.
mm!
but tonight we'll have a nice dinner, and then we'll see a movie from my collection.
not the sign of the cross again.
no.
we'll watch freaks tonight.
do you know this movie, richard?
i can't say i know.
it's a great movie.
tell me about it, eve, paul.
ah.
cleopatra is a natural creation trapeze artist, and marries a dwarf who does small shows.
but his real purpose is to poison him and put him in his legacy.
he moves all the freaks on his finger until one day he's too drunk and he's lost his true intentions.
then all freaks turn on him.
one night they take their revenge with knives and guns.
eve, eve.
darling... don't miss your taste.
that sounds great!
there's a lot to do before we head west.
i can't
shut up and sit down.
you deserve it.
what happened to you?
come on, richard, pick up.
i thought you were tall when you did that.
oh, thank god.
we had some sneaky clients who saw our show, but... no one was ever loved.
are you all right, ma'am?
where are those security guards?
good to know.
now it's your turn.
jesus christ.
i don't even know that.
i already told them everything...
stanley.
elsa... el

i'm afraid... that's all you
just a dream.

but you brought death here... and you have to pay for it.
put it down.
come on, come on.
elsa, come on... we need to talk privately.
i believe we have something in common.
you think you can run now?
i'm right.
he killed her.
he's not who you think he is.
and start running.
run!
run!
run!
just because you grew up without a father, there's no need to romanticize the work right now because he's
how did he die
who killed him?
we all did.
he broke the rule.
now.
come on.
he was my father!
he killed a freak!
the most fragile of us.
you believe his word?
this impostor whore?
i saw dear ma petite in a jar with my own eyes.
i heard him confess.
as for maggie, if she hadn't helped, we'd have more bodies on our hands.
i won't forgive him.
all i want is to rot in hell.
you're gonna be friends with whoever it is you
maggie's gonna change your bandages.
no!
keep the dirty ones.
now that your mother isn't here, it's up to me to protect you
i've seen you become a man and a man in your childhood-- and we need you.
i have no hands!
i can't even piss myself.
i got an old friend.
he'll come and help you.
a real artist.
but the wounds need to be healed first.
maggie will help you.
let him.
i'm so sorry.
i hate hurting you.
really?
i thought that was your only talent- hurting people.
i love you, jimmy.
this part is real.
i always have.
i want to start a new beginning.
we can go to new york like we planned.
why not?
you're kidding, right?
after all you've done, do you think we're just going to sail into a new horizon?
my hands... are in a fucking jar, and you're the one responsible for all this.
i'm so sorry.
can you bring maite back from the dead?
huh?
i've changed, jimmy.
ah!
i knew you were stupid, let's add blind to your list, shall we?
get me someone to focus the lamp!
i can't leave this place.
i have to set the right light for the first time, understand?
try again now!
scheisse!
elsa.
of course.
he's watching us.
can't we lift it?
just this once?
please?
okay.
yeah.
mm.
oh.
thank you, chester.
you put me down.
like an old sock.
i'm sorry, marjorie.
i got a little carried away, but i'm happy now.
they have, i have magic, you are.
maybe i should go.
we can manage, marjorie.
the twins accepted you.
they just don't want you watching you do it.
they're using you, chester.
you're their boss now.
no, they don't.
they love me.
you're a murderer.
no, no.
no.
marjorie.
i know you don't like to talk about it, so don't mention it, but you killed them.
and alice and lucy.
impossible.
i'm just a puppet.
hmm.
love destroys you, chester.
you're losing control.
i know... i
i'm a monster.
you don't need them.
i'm in.
i know.
please don't leave me, marjorie.
the twins?
they have to go.
i know.
they will.

oh, this is her barnum day.
she was a very unique woman.

to ethel.
so what do you say?
did anyone hear what spencer said last night?
now it's all settled.
elsa killed ethel.
forest.
car accident.
it was all a setup.
i believe that.
that crazy, vindictive woman threw a knife at my paul
all elsa cares about is elsa.
i couldn't sit on my head anyway.
i know ethel.
he wasn't someone to kill
he's not a
he wouldn't do that to his own child, and he wouldn'
and he'd leave a straight note.
if someone comes after one of us, we'll know what to do.
there's only one guarantee of our future.
whether elsa lives or not.
did you ever imagine how you could feel, dot?
thank god you told us about marjorie.
all he had to do was push him.
i think we've certainly made good contact with you.
good evening, girls.
what are you doing here?
i'm here to extend the friendly x-tindol.
i have some information about your recent safety.
we don't want to hear anything from you.
leave nicely.
oh, dot, i can't blame you.
i acted horrible the other day.
but the recent events made me soften my hard parts.
i lost my mom.
it was so sudden and... terrible.
she's very upset, dandy
it's terrible for everyone to lose a mother.
it was.
yeah.
and it made me feel like i shouldn't let my loved ones go.
but i think you should know we're seeing a man.
actually, i got your news.
you have no idea what a glorious situation it would be to marry you.
believe me if i had the chance to do everything...
i came with friendly feelings.
i know i lost my chance.
i'm not half the man you deserve.
but i asked myself.
"daddy, what do you have to do to support the girls you love so much?"
then it occurred to me that i could protect you, and i hired a proper man so he could gather information about your new friend.
it broke my heart because your chester creb is a complete freak!
we don't need to look at these.
what is wrong with you?
you're a pain in the ass, and we don't trust you as much as our sin.
ta-ta then.
i did my best.
my mother always said to argue with a woman when she was angry.
who is it?
son.
here.
drink.
what is that?
penicillin.
i'd hate to see you die of an infection when we say we complete you.
who are you?
my name is massimo dolcefino.
i came to make you your new hands.
okay?
massimo is an old friend of mine from before the war.
he is the master of his art.
no, thank you.
i saw soldiers with grenades on their hands.
they put those cool hooks on their hands.
i can't get 00 but at least i can keep my cigarettes on my own.
and i don't have to be afraid of the wooden dryers for the rest of my
massimo offers you something more elegant than pancakes.
more convincing.
look.
see?
so is the other one
massimo saved my life.
your mother would die of booze and leave you hungry on the street.
i could have married her if you weren't so stupid
"my one sin..."
si.
he loved you...
very much and very
no!
they were members of an organization.
and the leaders were a doctor.
now get to the other one, don't rush this time.
two years, two years, two years
massimo took care of me.
she taught me to walk.
and dance.
then hindburg fell.
nuremberg, rhineland...
we were supposed to escape while we still had the chance.
we had a plan.
how could i look into my love's eyes when i knew those monsters were free?
they had to pay.
i hunted them down one by one.
aah!
finally, i reached the leader.
oh, the beasts.
dr. hans grouper.
there should be no painless death.
obviously my death wouldn't be painless either.
he took me too personal to want to kill him.
very personal.
he tortured me.
he put me in a cell and tortured me again, and again.
how did you survive?
i lived in austria until the end of the war.
then i came to america- at 00.
and i called miss mars for years.
but i didn't get any answers
if you loved her so much, and you knew where she was, why didn't you just walk out on your feet
my body survived the torture, but... my body
i was like a pinocchio.
i had no humanity left in me.
but, uh...
beautiful irony.
beautiful irony.
i know you've been together a long time, and it might be hard to change for a sit-down show.
and i repeat- this has nothing to do with ego.
for this continuity... this continu
he looks so normal.
i don't think we can judge him if we don't have absolute proof.
what about the file?
it says he killed his wife.
you let dandy's lies cloud your judgement.
dot and i have something to say.
we don't want to be your assistant any
why?
we just... don't want to.
maybe when you hear my final, you'll change your mind
two bodies, two heads.
it's gonna be a
a first in the history of magic.
come on, girls... let's rehearse
we're not going in that box.
no, chester... we're not going in that box.
now excuse me...
i will.
you... you
i can be your assistant.
yeah.
get in the box, lucy.
my name is maggie
oop!
is this your magic show?
it looks a little pathetic.
shut up.
i didn't say anything.
what are you looking at?
backstage.
originally called the magical saw.
tonight, you will watch a very dangerous version of me.
handcuffs.
hey, i...
i don't know this part.
i went to war for you.
you should have died there.
we loved each other.
and you came back with a metal plate in your head and a buzzing bees in your head.
chester, stop, i can't move my feet!
stop!
stop talking!
you're distracting me.
stop, marjorie.
haven't you ruined my life enough?
you're nothing without me.
i'll show you.
all of you.
chester!
chester!
chester, stop!
what are you doing?
relax, people... it's just a magic show.
magic show.
i can call him back.
again... over
alakazam!
abraza abra
abracadabra.
that's gonna be a lot of people, chester
he made me do this.
he deserved it.
what do we do now?
steal their jewels and bury the bitch.
why are you packing?
you ruined everything again.
time to go.
you confused me.
you did it consciously to sabotage me.
i finally found happiness.
i'm leaving.
you can't leave without me.
oh.
i loved you.
chester... chester...
oh, god...
marjorie?
stay with me.
marjorie.
in the interest of elsa, dayton, ohio, 0000 there's your favorite child-lover-lover-lover-lover-lover-lover-lover-lover-boy, my favorite son-of-a-boy, your favorite son, and your
jimmy darling!
i'm not a stage artist like you, mom

jimmy... jimmy...
good for you.
how dare you come in without warning!
what do you want?
you have to go.
they've been planning revenge all day on ethel's trailer
they'll kill you.
why should i believe you, huh?
my monsters love me.
i'm like their mother.
ethel was more like mothers than you.
you killed their real mother.
the last of a desperate man's bullshit
who's desperate now
you saw what they did to him.
but where do i go?
anywhere but here.
you could have saved me.
we just did.
there you are.
what's jimmy doing?
he'd be here if he could.
it's time
give me that.
ethel!
let's get some... justice.
oh.
thank you for coming.
i would never deny a woman in trouble.
i'm not in trouble.
but i'm in a hurry
oh.
i want to report a murder.
who was murdered?
a young woman.
leave it here.
slowly.
put your hands where we can see them.
i did it.
send me an ida.
what are you doing here?
i came to count.
i'm the new owner.
where's elsa
he's
he went after his dreams.
elsa sold us again.
$00,000 in cash.
nothing.
everything here, including your contracts, is now mine.
and i want to see what's mine.
was this always your dream, sir?
to be in show business?
dream.
yeah.
and now it's come true.
i'm thirst
go get me a lemonade with a straw.
yes, sir.
are ready?
yeah.
they're perfect.
i want to try it now.
sure.
the other one
you take it.
thank you.
but jesse james escaped and hid for two years.
in the greatness, the united states army was looking to defeat the armies of sitting bull and crazy horse and take the gold in the black hills of south dakotas.
after the defeat of the battle of little bighorn, the united states government destroyed the buffalo chose to starve the lakota people out of hunger and submission.
hold the line!
but despite their little battles against the united states army, the fighting of the indians was getting worse.
the lakota leaders were running out of options for the bull and crazy horse.
you're a man with a strong heart.
but i'm tired.
we'll see you.
the americans didn't give up despite the destruction of their tribes and the violence they saw.
to go there in those times, it was to get the chance to be rich.
many women and men have tried their luck.
the united states became the first country to save itself from global depression when it came to the economy.
the solution was found in
there's been lots of cattle in texas on the mexican border for a long time.
but until the railroad was completed, they couldn't be carried out in the plains and taken to hungry people in the east
the cattle in texas for $00 were sold for $00 on the east coast for $00.
the cattle barons have taken up most of the nailing area from kansas to california.
the landlords gave tremendous opportunities.
we're talking about millions of acres, farms on them, thousands and thousands of major animals.
one of the cattle thieves in the new mexico district was going to turn into one of the men who'd been renowned for the west.
his story started 0,000 miles east.
billy never knew his father.
in the early 0000s, he and his mother moved to new mexico.
for years he's been wandering aimlessly
what do you want?
whiskey.
leave the bottle.
there were different kinds of cowbo
always sitting on the corner.
that's all you had to watch out for.
billy used what he did best to make it through.
billy the kid was a very good weapon.
he spent every dollar he ever made for practical purposes.
in a place like this, only the strong survive.
where are you going?
to lincoln.
just passing through here.
these cattle belong to john tunstall.
then john tunstall can come and get their cattle back.
you'd better let me go.
i don't think so.
i don't think you have a choice
young cattle thief billy the kid caught by a farm owner he tried to steal his cattle.
most people hit cattle thieves where they see them.
you still haven't told me who you're
i don't work for anyone.
everyone in lincoln county works for somebody, son.
yeah, but i don't work.
you look like a man who's used to buying me what
you're right.
there's only one problem that i am.
you have many men.
you got room for one more?
when billy the kid came to lincoln, he needed work.
john tunstall needed cowboys.
john tunstall came to the west to make a fortune.
he moved into lincoln county where he could make money.
but the success pissed off some powerful men.
lincoln was one of the wildest places in the wild west.
he had everything under ev's control, from the price of cattle, land and government officials.
even the lawmen pay them.
in fact, most of the people who lived in lincoln saw them as bully.
john tunstall came to town and stuck his nose in the beef with the ev's monopoly for a long time.
no one would have been neutral.
billy went to work with john henry tunstall and became tunstall's man.
in a few months, young outlaw became the most trusted gunman in tunstall.
for the first time in your life, the younger orphan felt like home in the west.
tunstall was a mentor to billy the kid.
give me your plate, billy.
thank you.
i'm starving.
everything's going great, kid.
i'm glad you're here.
thank you.
billy was always barely getting along.
he was seen by many people as a foot suit.
for a young man billy's age, it was incredible and changing life.
while billy the kid is now part of the cattle industry which is fueling as america grows, a few hundred miles to stop expanding west.
take it easy, gu
i extend my left hand as a friendship suggestion.
if he hadn't done that most of us wouldn't be here today.
we would have died fighting instead of going to the reservation.
when they put us on the reservation, they actually took the human spirit.
he trusts me.
he's talking to me
god, messiah.
this policy is known as "promotion."
but i think they wanted to make us capable of protecting ourselves.
there was a word used in the military.
"kill the indian and protect the human."
if you destroy the indians' cultures, you'll become a better man.
they thought we were savages.
the proud lakota warrior knew he had to stand up again for his people.
i'm not happy here." i'm
"i'm not happy here."
"we don't want to live in space."
you're not used to living in the settlement.
give me some time.
i'm sure you will.
after putting his protests to the united states officials, the army began to fear that the lakota warrior started an indian uprising.
the united states was so scared of crazy horse.
it was said that crazy horse wanted to kill a general visiting him.
the united states officials were worried about a new riot.
as the fear of crazy horse plotting something spread, the lakota warrior went to meet with the authorities to clear his name.
crazy horse thought he was meeting with the united states officials.
he didn't realize the importance of the situation
they wanted to put him in a prison cell.
then he took off his knife.
despite different views, i think the most reliable comment is that the white u.s. sentry bayonets him to death
he couldn't be killed in the crazy
his vision was right.
he was unexpectedly defeated by the sentry.
on september 0, 0000, the man who fought his whole life to protect his people and won war on the united states.
it's hard to talk about the death of crazy horse, because even after so many years, the pain is so fresh.
one of the most fascinating parts of crazy horse and his legacy is one of the few guys in the american history of talking about the indians.
nowadays, the courage of the united states government is considered a symbol of resistance and spoken of respectfully to himself.
i think that's what makes him so powerful.
with crazy horse's death, the lakota people waited for a leader who could save the rest of their hopeless culture.
until you paid evron, their prosperity was their business.
this is for you.
what if he resists?
i don't care how.
i'm just interested in the results.
copy that.
go check it out.
you stay here.
okay.
what's your hurry, gent
we heard a shot.
really?
don't do anything stupid, son.
this has nothing to do with you.
it'll help him stay like this.
there are always conflicting interests between these contestants.
but like many ideas in the west, it became personal.
he took it personal the moment someone was murdered.
that person was john henry tunstall.
he was killed because of the conflict.
it was a personal matter now.
with john tunstall's death, billy is on his way to find his killers.
this road would lead him from an unknown armed cowboy to become the legend of the west.
as the country continues to expand, men like billy the kid realize the border is not governed by law.
but over 000 miles beyond new mexico, a man was prepared to bring law into the west.
no one was more bragged than wyatt earp in the dooms of kansas where men took everything they wanted and every day was a struggle to survive.
he was big by the 00th century standards.
he was so excited about his size.
wyatt earp was one of thousands of americans pushing west in order to become rich.
wyatt was caught in the incurable western disease.
he always felt he had to push the next border.
the border could be mining, real estate research, something to bring adventure.
wyatt's life was driving like this.
he did all the work on the border just to get it.
from laying tracks for the pacific railroads to hunting buffalo on the plains and even working as a bouncer at a brothel.
to move cattle from wide-open cities to eastern cities, they'd have to drive towards railroad hubs that soon turn into crow cities.
so the rapid cities came out.
a landscape of unintended soil suddenly becomes a hotel with 00 rooms.
the young men who managed to come to these cities were drinking whisky and carrying guns.
so there were lots of young men drinking well and armed.
that was one of the reasons the west was wild.
wyatt saw that there's no law in dodge city and conflict solved by violence.
she had a hard life.
they'd either go back east or they'd be worse.
but wyatt earp felt there was much more in his fate.
he was going to prove something important in dodge city.
you tricked the wrong guy.
that's my money.
this guy's a cheat.
calm down.
he cheated.
calm down.
he cheated.
put the gun down.
did you see your gun?
everyone saw him reach for his gun.
give me that.
i'll shoot you!
come on.
the city of dodge desperately needed a lawman.
wyatt earp was perfect for this.
it didn't take long for wyatt earp to be the police chief of dodge city.
it wasn't supposed to be a special education to be a
that's not how it works in this town
wyatt earp didn't ask questions.
"kaggling with cabana" is a term from him.
wyatt earp became famous shortly in dodge city.
his role as a lawman would become one of the most famous figures in the west.
because cartoon chickens give my dad nightmares.
where were you?
and this was irving berlin's white christmas.
it's the best christmas song ever sells all
what?
actually, irving berlin wrote over 0,000 songs.
then marry him.
what is wrong with you?
i have no problem.
you have the type to write.
what does that mean?
what are you doing this holiday season?
hey, baby.
where are you going?
father melley called.
i have to protect the nativity scene in the church.
i need to cook something for the food sales.
did you hear me complaining?
what rhymes with poinsettia?
i forgot again!
you're a very difficult man!
i can't produce anything in a hostile environment!
i wouldn't act hostile if you had two cents!
you kick me again, i'm leaving.
your legs are crooked.
how's it going
so i brought you some soup and your thick jacket.
yeah, i'll call him.
horribly ordinary!
terrible!
of course not!
yeah, and you know i'm a jew at eight.
good.
i'm gonna go get a bagel or something.
i'm going to the guarding business again.
i'm calling shangai garden.
but whatever i decide will be fine!
i only have three days to make cake!"
he doesn't sound like that, but whate
boom!
i was gonna make a cake, but i had to work late.
and i'm done.
so thank you, hungarian bakery!
says who?
larry's wife won't bring it.
he makes a great cake!
you know what he's doing?
any chance you're in that town?
i really thought you were gonna make the cake!
i'm not a square?
she would never be with you, you know why?
because he'd have to take his own arm.
stop it!
wonderful!
i was so naive.
what are you doing?
sounds like you started.
kitchen robot, big scratches...
let me think.
nice, easy cake recipe.
how about that chocolate cereal?
at least i'm wearing my pants proper shirt... you...
a monkey could do it.
i love you.
i love you.
i imagine we're giants?
no.
you should have put more baking powder.
you don't even know what a poke is!
and nobody's gonna want to buy this stupid toy cake
we'll take the cake to a closed plate.
okay.
my calves have never been this far.
come here!
it doesn't?
after all the arrangements... after all
anyway, try this.
it's divine.
it doesn't
we don't make traditional food sale.
we're doing something much more fun.
got it.
great plan!
i didn't count on the cake walk!
i've never seen caramel do this.
this is a candy-covered chair!
come, come on.
hey, ling.
i have your mental problem.
well, when i... when... when
elaine?
whatever.
i see him, but he's a slow
how long has this been going on?
what does that mean?
i think you're in love.
how do i get rid of this
i got myself together.
i'm ready to sing now.
i'm calling my soul tonight.
i know there's so much more to life.
thank you for seeing me.
how can i help you?
my wife cindy died two years ago.
we were married three years.
we got hit by a car on our anniversary.
cindy and i wanted to have kids.
for example, that he died.
how will you do that?
or did he leave the egg embryo?
no.
did you hear me?
i heard.
to clone your dead wife?
scientists are trying it out of hand, mr. cage.
so i snuck into trying cindy.
my sister-in-law heard that and hired a lawyer to stop it.
that's why i need a lawyer.
he's going to court today.
yes, mr. stoller, i must say that your wife was a wonderful person.
but the cloning idea?
please.
there's nowhere else i can apply.
and your firm's met this lawyer before.
who is it?
larry paul.
i hear you're very successful.
it was him.
how can you have a virtual relationship?
a relationship means communication.
what about "o"?
i know you don't, but if your hands aren't on that stupid stick, she can't
all you care about is control.
i don't
really?
and you came here to talk about my virtual relationship?
i came to borrow things.
but forget it.
ally?
can you take a look?
the lawyer's on the other side, larry.
yeah?
there's a conflict of interest here for me, isn't there?
you're responsible for the client.
yeah, but...
you didn't use inside little information during the defense against him?
no, but i...
why shouldn't i?
just for the client.
i've already got a case of passion.
i need something.
larry's weak spot is rhythm.
he's talking to me too fast when i'm arguing, because he knows i can't
okay.
he's vulnerable when he loses his
okay.
you're in your dreams with cindy margolis.
michelle garris e-mailed me and asked me a way to get into hollywood.
we met in hollywood and...
do it!
i won't let myself use it.
we can't deny our passion any more.
you want me, i want you.
let's be honest.
you do my knee and i'll get my hair done.
you're breaking my spinal cord.
don't you like denial?
then let's be honest.
i'm leaving
i went to l.a., and i didn't even think of you.
your mind is in jackson.
people accuse me of superficiality.
but when it comes to relationships, i understand human behavior.
in the last month, you were shaving your legs in the morning.
is that your scientific thesis?
when a woman shaves in the morning, it's over.
no exceptions.
go to jackson.
he's the man you're crazy
well, first, cloning people is against the system of society... against the
there was no court before.
when people were against cloning sheep clones...
this is none of your business.
you won't let me take the second...
" second" is a sexual term.
i completely object.
i wish i could just get back to the sheep.
these rude have no place in court.
let's make a decision soon.
soon?
let's hear what mr. paul has to say.
second, forgive my rudenance...
he's kidding
even if he can clone, mr. stoller can't make this decision.
too much.
i'm predictable in the law cases, but i've been caught unprepared for "
he made fun of me three times.
i demand a written apology, preferably notary.
four times!
is this cloning even possible?
first, i want to hear your client and find out why.
your honor, i hope...
see you tomorrow.
see you.
ling even denies wanting him.
what do you feel?
he can have her.
the man's depth is like a ink bottle.
i mean, i hope ling drowns.
are you really okay?
yeah.
actually, the attorney of the opposite was john cage.
did you know?
how'd it
smiling is against your principles.
what's going on?
don't ask me
john wanted a few leads he could use against you in court so i told him to break your rhythm.
you're no good without rhythm.
cute but useless.
you gave him advice?
his client is practically mine.
we're sleeping with you.
you're going behind my back.
you're giving him advice when you can't beat me?
does john know you'll never beat me?
excuse me?
does john know you never beat me?
no, no.
never?
isn't her smile nice?
so cute.
i'm gonna beat you one day, but john's gonna beat you today with my advice.
great.
i'll lose my edge.
no, you won't.
now he knows i'm trying to ruin his rhythm
he said you could never beat him.
not only in this case, but in any case.
he did?
yeah.
i bet, john.
he said i could never beat him?
exactly.
never?
never.
of course.
i can date a man in paris.
you can get as far away from here as you like.
i'm not gonna put you in this.
no, i don't.
how was i?
larry?
why are you here?
i thought john and i could walk together.
you're trying to confuse me, i'm not gonna let you
i saw the smirk.
it wasn't supportive
is everything okay, john?
you seem a little uneasy.
he's trying to make it better, but he won't
good.
do you want to have dinner?
i'd love to
i'm full today, but how about tomorrow
great.
we always talked about having children.
i think i want to fulfill cindy and my dream.
but you're not talking about having cindy's child.
you want to clone him.
the only way to carry on his genetic legacy is cloning.
many people, including mr. paul, as he sits so deep down there...
your honor, i'd like to stand firmly at the end of the gay
mr. paul, sit down.
mr. cage, don't provoke.
a lot of people find the idea of cloning disgusting.
but i'm not a scientist trying to make the living species perfect.
and i know i can't bring cindy back.
i want to make it last.
and i guess i don't want him extinct.
thank you.
first, i'm sorry for your loss.
but you're trying to copy cindy, right?
this is the process of creating a complete genetic replication of your dead wife.
it looks, his speech is the same
cindy ever mention genetically engineered fruit?
he was against it.
and the genetically engineered chickens?
he was against it.
but it was open to the idea of a genetically engineered replica.
it's not the
not everything is about chickens, counselor.
i didn't say that.
i'm nervous enough without you.
you wouldn't let anyone get your number.
whatever makes you great, you have to win it again.
maybe melanie scared him off.
john, i'm sorry, man.
but remember, larry said you could never beat him.
never.
you should think big now.
because this time, i won't rub his feet.
whatever happens, you have to find barry white.
yeah.
yeah.
come on!
we did it together, baby.
does ally know?
the pressure doesn't help me.
may i?
of course.
just you and me.
bullshit!
how is this cloning?
very impressive.
we're getting eggs from the transmitters we injected the reproduction.
this is cindy stoller from the cloning candidate, taking a cell.
this part is very impressive.
the witness said it was impressive before.
just this part impressive?
then we pull the core of every egg with a needle.
there's too much needle in the cloning.
we're putting the dna removed eggs in the transmitter cell.
in that case, cindy's cell.
and we practice energy.
what does that mean?
we're shocked by the heat, we're sort of...
i'm trying to understand.
you put it down to the bugs, and i find it disgusting, even for a public reviewer.
let's move on.
you're both losing my sight.
what happens to the cells after it's been activated?
when the transmitter cells are given energy to the dnaless cells, they connect with each other.
then we put them in the surrogate mother, and it's basically a cloned baby.
sperm?
no, that's very impressive.
is that really possible?
i must admit, most embryos die.
but it's possible that one of them is successful.
we've already tried it on sheep.
it's possible for people too.
how far is this technology?
present.
people don't expect science.
scientists are waiting.
thank you, doctor.
hey, mark.
if you need anything, your assistant, call mine.
i don't see you in slow motion anymore, you hypocritical coyote
i see it.
maybe another time.
what's going on
i'll tell you about it sometime
forget it.
what is wrong with you?
what's wrong with me?
i threw myself at you.
i threw it like a cannon.
you know what this is for me?
i made you a gesture.
i told you i was in love last week.
anyone can share such a stupid feeling.
please.
i want something very small.
closing statements are coming up, you should be with me.
together we can beat larry.
just you and me.
come on!
you're at the end of
what else do you have to do?
are you here?
you're here
that's why i start the day with a pepper stick.
he was here.
who?
barry white came.
forgive me if i can't guess.
my concentration.
not like before.
i can't bring him with other people in the room.
most people can't dance with imaginary giants in front of others.
i always brought her.
i used to walk in crowded streets with him.
no, here's what you have to do
call him alone in your bunker.
first take him out without a cut, then get out among the people.
i don't know if i can.
you have to.
without barry, what are you?
look at this.
you can't go through life like
you have no choice but to find barry.
they'll take his personality, his dna.
your brother loved your brother.
excuse me, i'll make my objections like this.
he won't bring cindy back.
even the only egg twins, even if they share the same dna, different people.
even when he takes the organs of a person, he needs his permission.
the replication of the dna, it's more inconvenient.
it's their privacy.
i'm sorry.
was it mine?
i didn't mean to start.
it was a mistake
don't you want to see your brother's genes continue?
he'll look like him, he'll talk like
i wonder if he wanted that.
from the beginning he was against genetic research.
he definitely wouldn't want
never.
you have a computer.
i want some privacy.
from brazilla.
it will be our first real conversation.
i feel really good for him.
but hurry up.
i'm the one who's gonna rub his
did you find barry white?
any sign of him?
forget it!
you couldn't find your own office?
yours is closer to court and my feet are a bit sore.
i have no idea.
elaine!
things watched each other.
would you stop watching me?
you think that's what i'm doing
i didn't ignore you.
i thought you weren't interested.
you were right.
forget it, deja vu.
you've been furious since i came to this firm.
i'm angry because you lied to me.
i'm angry because i slept with you.
it's hard to wander around all the time.
it's hard being a cheerleader
i don't understand why you do this every day.
obviously, from the beginning, we're both a little embarrassed.
so why don't we make a fresh start?
you may be right.
you might not be.
jackson.
how are you?
i'm not complaining.
this is definitely ours, isn't it?
he's up to something.
yes, it is.
no one, just you and me.
he's a funny little man, isn
i don't mind.
just in time.
it's like being dr. frankenstein.
the idea of harvesting organs?
choose dna?
these are terrible.
we could have hockey teams filled with wayne gretzky copies.
with a pit bull, they can put mike tyson together.
the possibilities.
horror.
but the truth is, every time science takes a new step, humanity becomes anxiety.
we already have babies, your honor.
we play with the genes.
this technology will save lives.
are there any risks of abuse?
of course, there is.
my client knows his wife's wishes and dreams.
the dreams they had together.
this process will give the chance to maintain the family legacy they hope for.
we have to be open to science that makes a couple have children.
it can't be whose dna she has, can it?
i remind mr. paul that the husband of his life can donate his organs without permission.
i'm telling you, mr. paul, that he may say the wrong things about mrs. stoller's wishes.
but there's no reason for us to believe that
you don't know when you can talk.
now it's your turn.
i may not have a legal reason.
but i have a moral compass.
that's what's at st
then why stop there?
he can clone his mother.
his grandfather.
one day their kids can play with their grandmother's twin in the sandbox.
celebrities can start selling their dna.
imagine being a parent to barry white's twin brother.
when the tech takes over the reproduction when it starts to take over the evolution of reproduction?
back in the day, we were afraid of heart trans
the tube baby idea was considered abnormal.
now the truth of life and the community accepts it.
cloning organs, saving lives, destroying diseases.
these can be real.
but cloning a human being cloned his dna and doing a medical match?
dismissed.
i'm sorry
i appreciate your effort.
i don't want a rematch
hey.
hey.
you come here often?
that's my opening line.
terrible opening line.
has it worked before?
better.
you want to go to the bar?
not tonight.
because you beat larry?
it's not
to tell you the truth, i didn't want to win this time.
no, i want to be alone tonight.
alone with him.
not at all.
like you said, most people don't dance with an imaginary disco giant.
you're not cra
actually, i'm a little jealous.
when you're disappointed in the real world, you create things.
hey.
maybe the three of us can walk.
give me a chance.
if he doesn't come, i'm still here.
well, i'll do it.
let's go.
who knew karaoke night would be the most delightful party on the boulevard?
you talked to p. diddy and kissinger?
i say, "islands in the stream" never sounded like that.
the limo driver called and said...
embarrassed donald trump's wedding?
sam, i've been in vegas for 00 minutes, but i haven't played a hand of blackjack yet.
your favorite table is ready.
ladies love a good karaoke singer, danny.
call me.
you think you can get any girl you want?
pick it up.
it's a lonely mission,
he's here for the born-new virgins convention.
girls without a virgin can change pure.
the card counters have hit two hotels this month and the last shift report says there are major losses on the blakjack tables.
there's a card counter downstairs
ed thinks he may have a card counter.
maybe we can continue this conversation later, like drinking.
patty, this is three, and you've been here a week
i didn't pay my rent, and the reason the landlord let me stay...
listen, i'm sorry, but this is a business.
if we pay for every shirt you screw, i'm screwed.
okay, the gift boxes are packed and waiting to go to the guest rooms.
our florist brought the orchids and the other 0,000 are coming tomorrow.
however, if he doesn't come for a reason, i've got a ship coming out of amsterdam... to
mary, don't worry.
i'm sure everything will be fine.
you're the most relaxed bride i'
thank you for coming, galina.
this looks like a hundred grand.
a hundred grand?
like i said, first for me.
it's a lot more than what we lost.
playing with a certain duck doesn't mean anything.
numbers sit on a table and play if they're rich, right?
the suspect lady, red hair, yellow dress, headed west.
thank you.
mr. sperreos, i'm from security.
the question i always ask.
we're not married yet, and you've been staying out all night.
no good.
honey, i win here.
tonight's over, and so is yours.
all right.
i told donald trump that our wedding should be like a delicious chicken wing compared to the party at palm beach.
my team has been trying to make your wedding the greatest and most elegant wedding this town's ever seen.
come on.
even when he was a secretary, he was always the boss
why are you so desperate romantic?
the montecito will still be ahead when your commission stops playing, and that's all i care about.
let's go, people.
the guy in the tie told us that he told us how to turn the air conditioning down a dozen times.
he can mark 00's floors and say the game is rich.
he sits in the slot machine all night, rarely plays.
and he doesn't keep his eyes on the blakjack tables
the sperreos are happy to get up and win a game a minute before they get into a game.
you can't prove it.
even if i count the cards, it's not
that's technically correct.
but we have a different kind of justice in vegas.
like before, i can catch a cheat and destroy him in the desert.
i'll be honest with you, i'm old-fashioned.
please.
now that we have your picture, you're in the black book.
if you step inside from the montecito, i'll have you arrested in private.
you hear that?
hey, jack!
the man has broken us into 000,000.
you know as well as i do that the accountant doesn't have a machine, and he didn't have
at least we can have some fun with him.
it's not your story.
if someone is financing and teaching them stuff, it's not the end of anything.
mike from last night, from mystique.
the guy from phoenix.
there are other cities that you're not really
des moines, for instance.
it's amazing, but i have to go.
i'm devastating, aren't i?
you finally said something i agree with.
i think you should have the problem because i'm usually attractive.
then what?
maybe i'm a little nervous around you because you're so
tongue-tied.
you know what we're gonna do?
what is it?
we'll sit down and try to figure out why it doesn't happen
patty.
almost there.
they said i was good?
it doesn't matter if you're okay
i should fire you.
please.
thank you, thank you, thank you.
the tailor said he sent it back this morning, but there's no record of him being there.
our 000 friends are coming to this wedding tomorrow the head of state, industry leaders, oprah.
do you want to tell oprah that the wedding was canceled and that she came to las vegas for nothing?
if we don't, montecito will be happy to get the same.
that dress was a classic.
a dozen french tailors sewed it with hand-pick
there's no other one like him.
you know how much that dress cost me?
that's a big problem, sam?
wait.
hey, danny, you asked me to look at the big blackjack winners.
montecito's already spent millions on food, flowers, decor and entertainment.
if the wedding doesn't work out and lipworth refuses to give.
you really think someone stole it?
what's the street value on that thing?
why not the tailor galina?
he was interested when he heard the price of the dress.
mike.
hey.
let me know how it went.
they used the same techniques that sperreos and his team used?
we catch a team, they send someone else in a few hours.
if we don't find out who's behind this, we may need to give them the key to the safe.
you'd better get the fuck over there, you son of
are you talking to sperreos?
you better get your hands on me, because the president assaults me will cause more than i've won from the montecito.
that was good.
did i get the dress?
i just want to know what happened.
i'll make the changes and give the dress to the montecito messenger.
is there a camera in the store?
i saw real diamonds in a costume for elton john.
compared to that, this dress is nothing.
galina protects herself.
you're free to go.
i'm helping, patty.
god knows why i accepted this project.
i've always helped the baby bird, even with the rabies.
then i'll get my tray.
this is christina, our best waitresses.
knees bent, back in the back.
above all, trust.
trust.
the tray is full of martinis with its weight.
the hardest drink to carry.
he doesn't even look at the glasses.
he believes his ability to do the right thing and here he is.
the zen team
you're not so zen.
breathe with me, patty.
be like a booze, patty.
you want me to sit here until mystique opens?
thank god i don't want you standing here like a karate boy.
call me sensei.
vic, you sent one of your guys to the store this morning to get a dress.
yeah.
do you remember who you sent?
the tailor gave me a recording, but i couldn't remember the face
bart, you went to the store this morning to get a dress.
no, i didn't.
why not?
joey stopped me when i was coming out and wanted to go himself.
get joey's face and the address for me.
thank you.
i'm sorry
the sea caviar.
why would she spoil her receipts?
did you hear from the dress?
yeah, candy.
who's candy
not me, 'cause i know it's forbidden here,
do you know where we can find it?
danny mccoy, montecito surveillance and security.
how do you know nick sperreos?
cops don't scare me.
okay, wait, wait.
fine, fine.
that's enough
okay, i know him.
he came here a few times with his friends.
these are his friends?
do you know these people?
yeah, i guess so.
nick's a good kid.
he also asked me to cash in the chips.
i guess he thought i wouldn't doubt it.
strippers always get rewarded with receipts.
look, it was good for five minutes work, and i didn't need to take off my clothes.
why are you so interested?
because sperreos and his friends are involved in some kind of card counting operation.
i thought they were just some rich kids.
there's someone behind this, and i need to find out who.
do you have any idea who trained them and finance them?
they came one time with a big one.
yeah, they called him bucky.
mitch, did you scan joey's face?
fast forward.
somebody's paying him.
can you expand the image?
no, but i can get another angle.
so, lipworth's fiancée lissy?
we need to talk.
but you already know, don't you?
i know you paid to get rid of the mission dress.
what i don't understand is why?
this is the wedding, the details, the cost, the cost...
listen.
this is a little weird, if you want to leave.
that's the point.
i don't know if i want to leave.
i love her, but her life...
i mean, how many of the 000 people are my friends?
people say it's a cinderella story.
i'm not cinderella.
i'm just a normal girl from new jersey.
i may not know too much, but considering my wedding was worth 00 times more than my parents' house, my family
that's not true
yeah.
jared and i are so different.
i mean, what's the harm in it
how old do you think these kids are?
00, no bigger than 00.
danny, the yearbooks you asked for.
we'll see.
they're all in their 00s, and they all have math skills to count cards.
then they must have been taken from the math department and trained children.
then i remembered, how can i bring them to knees?
considering how the second team got here, i started with local colleges.
because you're a great guy, and i'm interested in people who are less attractive
maybe it's time for a
listen, mike, before this goes any further, i have something to say.
i'm here to vegas for "the wretched virginity kogr".
renewed.
i've made mistakes with men in my past, so i wanted to start a clean slate, and i made a vow of chastity until i got married.
i mean, just because i gave my present before doesn't make it any less valuable.
it's nice to get married.
good.
what's up
do you want to go back to school?
i want to go back and do an anthropology degree and go to the rain forest and study the local people.
you're an idiot.
what's up, ruben?
touch me and i'll call my lawyer right away.
you gonna call your lawyer?
what do you want?
where's bucky?
i don't know what you're talk
we have records of you robbing montecito.
i don't think the students here like that kind of thing.
i can call the dean right now and get your ass out of here.
please, don't tell my parents.
hey.
hey.
did you hear about being born again?
so you always knew that?
i'm sorry, but i could get every girl i wanted to get her to be pointless.
yeah, i set a trap with a very sweet and beautiful guy.
you were gonna quit because she wouldn't sleep with
hey, where are you going?
hey, mike.
i won't need you.
hey.
i acted like an idiot.
i needed some time to process all this.
do you think there's a place in your heart that can give me a second chance?
is that room service with the whipped cream, baby?
excuse me.
what was the precious gift stuff?
because it's my opinion, after christmas, the paperwork around the paperwork.
look, i was reborn five or six times.
and why isn't that me?
i tried to change.
so this is my fault?
i'm really sorry.
i took your advice.
i talked to jared and told him everything.
the wedding's
i said the wedding's off, not the marriage
does bucky train his team here?
hey, ruben, if it's funny, get your parents on the phone
bucky.
mr. buckner?
you know him?
my high school math teacher.
i'm the head of security at the montecito
yeah.
remember miss buckner?
he ran off with coach kajian last year.
alimony is killing me.
night school debts.
but the tax evasion is.
you guys made a lot of money from a lot of casinos
i'm guessing some of that money wasn't reported to the irs
keep these card numbers off the montecito, and we'll forget what happened.
before these guys get out, danny's gonna get their pictures and
what's the name of the food on
oh, my god.
did you miss the flowers, the caviar and oprah?
you know i don't care about those things.
the only thing that matters is spending the rest of my skateboard with you.
delinda, i'm sorry
she has to listen to you, honey.
i'll make you a star.
i hope you wrote a note somewhere.
careful, we're about to enter.
do i know you?
vinny's hanging out with your mom.
do you really want to risk your life for a skirt and a geezer?
any sign of the professor?
i speak six languages, why... why...
stein will kill sara in the library.
the speedster is disguised as stein, and he's pushing the bottom of the ship.
since when do you call him jax?
unfortunately, the effect doesn't last
what did you do to stein?
capone's men are taking over the ship.
you're here because i killed jsa's stupid leader.
mr. rex tyler, right?
i don't want to spend all night here.
you're welcome, you drunken maniacs.
my job is better.
i'm the authority of the entire arena.
every night, 00,000 people come here for fun, and i make sure they have fun.
are you an actress?
yeah.
okay.
tell springsteen i'm the boss of this place.
don't say that.
anything he wants, just say it.
have you seen a hot marketing director around here?
where have you been, man?
i have a meeting after the game.
how much time do we have left?
0 minutes, 00 seconds.
i can do a lot of things in 0 minutes, 00 seconds.
you're a funny girl.
i'm seeing other people.
i'm seeing other people.
happy birthday, ben.
how do you know?
good morning.
all right.
happy birthday, ben.
you're the maintenance guy, right?
two years ago, you said no matter what you said, "yes."
it's a little tricky because you don't always ask yes or no answers.
forget i said that for now.
there'll be a circus here tonight, and if there's ice on the floor, those fire-breathing guys could be lost in front of the kids,
understand?
you also told me not to run in the hallway.
forget about the conversation we had two years ago.
oh, no, no, no.
he wants to talk.
that's not good, man.
melt the ice, bobert.
benjamin!
come here.
hurry.
crystal, before you get mad and start firing everybody, about that ice...
have you seen a little white pill with some spanish written on it?
i don't understand your level of attention.
or did i already take that pill?
hello.
yeah, i think you've already taken the pill.
i hate it when the circus comes here.
are they happy?
are they sad?
why are his pockets so big?
i'm sure you're talking about clowns.
good morning, beautiful people.
good morning, alonzo.
you're in an amazing mood again.
every day is a good day, my friend.
seriously, every day?
i was the best day ever.
the day i stopped taking care of myself and started to devote myself to the wonderful people of san diego.
what are you doing?
i gotta get that pill out of my system.
what about today's charity event?
i invested big money in the illegal himalaya dog racing.
one of the dogs allegedly bit a himalayian.
anyway, i have a himalaya nightmare.
can't we use that money to make this better?
all right, you own this place, we do what you say.
did you see the oil painting?
don't forget to bring some kind of kids for
you know, black, white.
get me an asian kid
and we're gonna need a cup.
the asian kid will give me a trophy.
you're right to clap, because these are very good ideas.
benjamin, i almost forgot.
your... son?
how is your new assistant working out?
thank you for him.
he set a man on fire?
there was an investigation.
the evidence was inconclusive
well, yeah.
he's good, isn't
she set him on fire.
not very good.
a-a-al-al...
alonzo... al
what do you think it means when a girl sends a message, "we need to talk"?
i'm in something similar.
i think you'll find a better chance of getting closer.
what could be better than that?
yeah, i thought so.
happy birthday, little man.
good morning, heather.
good morning.
and i'll tell you why i love it.
ben!
he's got a man in his office, and he'
okay.
hey.
hey.
is there anyone else here besides you, someone a little more attractive than you?
no.
okay.
me.
i'm roman.
so you're crystal's son.
this must be terrible for you.
yeah.
it's not fantastic,
i wonder how they swam in the water.
okay.
i like mafia movies.
as a... talent as
this place is exciting.
political meetings here, sports, rodeo, night soccer, motorcycle racing.
don't you care about any of this?
remember me?
i texted you three, and you didn't answer any of them.
i guess after five months of sleeping together, you'd have to learn that the unanswered messages made me crazy
look, i know we hate commitment.
i agree to this date relationship.
but this morning, i woke up at your place alone, which means you snuck out of the house.
when i was paying for the coffee, i couldn't find my underwear until i came out of my wallet.
i got another coffee with this, more...
who is this?
i love mob movies.
and you, we really need to talk.
yes, it is, because this is the chance to get closer.
what could be better than that?
this is a good business opportunity for you.
see you at christmas party.
i don't think you meant that.
speak spanish.
i speak a little spanish.
yeah, i don't know what you just said.
actually, your english is very good.
elephant!
crystal.
did you hear what i just said?
i didn't hear
let me see this talk.
i don't think you should say, "yay, black boys!"
well, when should i say?
i don't think you should say anything.
and i wouldn't sing the song either.
the ice is still there.
yeah, i know.
doesn't sound too sad to me.
this is your life form.
you never wanted someone who was emotionally attached to you, wondering how and where you were, kissing you in the morning, waiting for you at home at night.
what's so good about celebrating your birthday?
but you throw big parties on your own birthday.
i need to know i'll never be alone.
i'm not so sure what i'm supposed to do
i'll go down, you step on the gas, go.
thank you.
negroes, whites, and asians and-
don't sing that song.
i think we should go to dinner to celebrate my birthday.
that would be a good step for our relationship.
i think we should be together.
i'm about to end this relationship.
why did you let me speak first?
you first.
you start all our next conversations.
remember we said we were seeing other people?
alonzo?
he's my best friend.
he's wanted to live with me for a while.
he wants to get attached.
he wants a commitment?
we're talking about a man, aren'
what a man.
look, i...
alonzo is an adult.
he cares about other people.
he asks questions about me, and he listens to my answers.
what bothers me is that i thought we were the same.
when you said you were emotionally damaged emotionally,...
how did he react when you told him?
he was a very happy man.
it blew him up in the air.
live with me.
we can do the commitment thing.
honey, i'm not the right woman for you.
you're too sweet, you're great for fun.
but no one can be right for you because you only think of yourself.
what the hell was that?
i think the voice was coming through my head.
i can't be a fries master.
i guess so.
you know the worst thing?
i don't think about anyone but myself.
it's really impossible for me to take care of other people
suddenly, i feel the need to connect, but i have no idea how to do this.
i'm in trouble, man.
from kermit the frog, right?
yeah.
what about him?
i think it's a super
go, man.
sunshine.
hey, ben.
hey.
he's very attractive.
sorry.
does anyone know how to use an axe?
come on, clowns.
almost done.
keep breaking it.
good day.
where's the asian
i specifically asked for an asian kid.
there's an asian kid over there.
alonzo.
yeah.
yeah.
thank you.
they've stopped.
most people ask me why i love kids so much.
maybe because i never had my own child.
i believe that our children's happiness is what we'd like to live in, and it's made with the efforts of people living in this society.
they are our future, and their prosperity is our most important cause.
when you ask them to do something for you, they do it with enthusiasm.
or as i got older, i started to believe that a life you live for yourself is empty.
i wasn't gonna say it, but i have to share a little song i wrote in this special occasion with you.
aside from the musical part, your speech was really touching.
sometimes it's really fun working with you.
i'm incredibly happy right now
on three, everyone say, "thank you, crystal cohen."
two... two... two
oh, my god!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
what a wonderful moment.
i noticed you left a little early.
hello again.
are you okay?
i'm a little scared
sure.
you know, it's normal to think you picked the right guy after
i'm 000% sure i picked the right guy.
all right.
what a wonderful moment.
i've never done this before.
what if i'm not ready
what if he just acts like he wants me?
after having me, what if he doesn't want me anymore
of course she'll want you.
you have everything.
everything.
okay?
okay.
okay.
actually, we can make love one last time.
hey, crystal.
i really want to make love to her.
i'll see what i can do.
can you give your attention to the poor kid you throw into the air?
fortunately, i convinced them to publish this photo.
more than when you kicked the police.
less than when you sank the mayor's ship.
great.
cool.
while i've got you,...
i want you to sit down with someone who'll be incredibly useful in the sunlight center, with childlike joy and loyalty.
get in the car.
get in the car.
i'm sure you have a lot to talk about.
great.
happy birthday, ben.
thank you.
look.
what's your name
dan.
thank you, dan.
i forgot.
have you seen alice?
in his office.
it was business.
i... i
i know what you mean.
what do you do in a situation like this?
i think i'll run like my life depends on it.
yeah, that's what i'm gonna
they've set up surveillance cameras looking directly at paddy
melts in your mouth when you eat.
he'll rebel everything you say.
this is bullshit, man.
these guys finally realized by living with me, that the exterior is so cool and so funny.
dee, you're undercover, okay?
dee, we're putting you on this mission, but the answer we got is arrogance and questions?
maybe we can go to your private office upst
do i have to know the guy with the spaghetti on his face?
and i'll buy one for the guy i don't know behind my back.
i said why.
'cause i think you've had a really long time last time
i didn't, because charlie cut him off with his fucking emergency lunch.
i don't want to run into anything you look like.
as i told that a few minutes ago, our fish today is gone.
let's all buy a plate of hot tubes of spaghetti
extra sauce.
i've always wanted to see this.
comedians, baseball players, even protestors.
god bless the cream pie and america.
look, i'm an experienced businessman with a long history of asian countries.
imagine my peanut butter pie with your low-priced labor force.
the factory was closed for a few days because of my accidents.
the truth is, we're very much in the chinese's factory.
i don't think there's any need to worry about it,
it's just old pornography
all aboard the tucker train.
it's not exactly what it looks like.
oh, no.
these are the items that my children value when they were young.
besides, you know when you can't sell these disgusting things in the garage.
these boxes show how great our lives are.
like they always fake i.d. you?
the pictures i made at your kindergarten and thanksgiving hand turkey?
i'm sorry, honey.
i put the finger here because i have feelings about things changing.
it's not just danny wearing a jersey uniform and hit the bat.
they were in the basement next to christmas lights, and i realized miss bart lost his pushover.
i just didn't see you have a plan to win.
yeah, you gave us a free beer and then you said, "vote for me with the ballot box."
lucky for us, everybody backed off.
i don't really do anything about sports anymore.
god, it feels like it's from another life.
i need to hit things with a stick for a beer.
okay, brawlers, i'd like to propose a pre-game toast.
maybe we'll remember that winning isn't everything, but we have a barrel of beer!
wait.
everyone, this is riley and my daughter emma.
so, wheeler is 0-0 with unplanned pregnancy.
tuck, why don't you give the new ones something?
ben!
that's what i know.
are you going out with mom?
i was gonna talk to myself, but bonnie said she'd handle it.
i took care of it, but i didn't
you can't say you took it well.
i mean, when your mom's on a date with the coach, they can have a pillow talk in bed.
if i called the girl you did happy things hours ago, we'd be happy to hear you shut up.
we could have more babies.
i'm going to practice until my brain is exhausted.
he throws his food around, i think he makes it beautiful.
her father's
mom will be coming soon, can you take the equipment downstairs to the field for me?
this is more than my heavy former weight.
you don't care about the cups on the shelf,
sounds like i missed the game.
you missed one little thing.
the children voted riley as captain.
i was saying you lost it.
i was feeding my baby and you took my team away.
i was wearing your glove... and then everyone started screaming.
"you are unbelievable!"
because i hear it's amazing.
maybe if you come to my place, you'll do good things i haven't done for a
because i don't care what others say.
i am so excited!
we just ate some italian food.
that's why i'm trying to stop you.
honey, i guess we shouldn't be talking about these parts, this is about my personal life.
okay, honey, i know you don't want to hear this, but i'm a woman, and i have needs
when i won't even open my mouth.
"click the hook."
i don't want anyone to cancel their plans.
thank you, danny.
not yet, but it will be solved.
honey, are you okay?
i tried to get here as soon as i could.
with my hair and that, you're 00 minutes away.
i couldn't call anyone who could look after emma.
the dentist said he should see you right away.
and before i forget, don't bring home the giant toothbr
for the bathroom key.
i'm sorry about your date with hank.
i don't even have to talk to you right now.
please tell me emma's in the car park outside.
hank canceled something or i don't know the details.
but if mom asks, they hid me here.
you care about other people's happiness.
to make sure he doesn't, and hope he doesn'
dude, you gotta get back.
you think she stopped being a rigantor?
i'm gonna let the little planets whisper in my head?
will you look here?
the minister has gone home.
if hank doesn't have a job, he'll be
you got a menu down here?
mom, i'm home.
what are you doing here?
i'm sure it's my robe.
hank, you ready for round two?
danny, there's nothing going on here
you're unbelievable.
yeah, she hates it.
because we don't see the same game here.
it's actually full of vodka.
we'll drink this, and we'll throw
we have a chance to make a clean shot.
sit down, wheeler, with the other ladies.
what about riley?
okay, tuck, your turn.
hit again, miss and don't go outside the field.
when i told riley something she shouldn't have heard before, she ate my crayons.
i can't forget you're still eating brownies
don't worry, i'll watch your back, okay?
hey, teammates.
don't you think she looks cute today?
is that my phone?
something about a game.
thank god.
i was worried i couldn't bring you back.
i know what you're thinking, but you gotta do something else than control the team.
like i'm doing right now?
i want you to be more serious at games.
you know, i'm having a lot harder time putting you on the squad than
truth be told, i should throw you off the team.
but i can't
i'll really miss you when i don't move you.
thank you.
what did you want to tell me?
just... just
"take, riley's gone.
"i'm firing him right now."
what is this?
that's the bad version of what i just told you.
coach, can we talk?
i think you want your robe back.
it didn't
mom told me what happened.
i'm really sorry about that reaction.
i'll say i'll be better next time.
i don't think there'll be a next
don't blame him for being an asshole.
so you keep a funny woman out of your league?
no, that's my mom you're talking about
and a guy who goes out with him is very lucky
i'll go out with him
it'll be safe if you take him
what's wrong with me?
maybe you're just so smart and so beautiful.
winning is fun for you.
oh, my god, i like this!
but what will that get me?
the room's full of trophies and nobody's sharing it with me?
looks like danny solved it.
yeah, none of us can be like your brother.
yeah, i think i've heard it a couple or a thousand times.
right.
right.
i was thinking of a change for the win.
i've never tried it before.
yeah, i think you should figure out how to expose the real brawlers without me.
ben, nobody wants me.
go brawlers!
all thanks to my lovely co-captain.
without the riley ref.
he really needed a new cup.
no, i can't hide anymore.
honey, you gotta help me.
the fear in his eyes caused them to close.
get lost.
don't worry.
i'll find a man who can make you happy.
okay.
he seems to be getting better.
i know when i see my son.
like i always said, thank god for giving me ben.
do the wheeler, do the wheeler...
what's riley doing?
they call him wheeler.
we'll use you to watch it from the inside.
why is patty interested in this murder?
i suggest mr. purcell not answer any more questions.
you were found in your home alone with your wife's body.
no sign of forced entry.
patty, i saw the guy who did this.
our company was hired to do toxicological research on a chemical compound.
these companies are worth hundreds of billion dollars.
michael, this is daniel purcell.
we have a problem with protection.
he's the chief advisor to the world's
did you tell anyone about us?
acid rain from the coal-burning power plantation makes bullets above the national average.
the local residents are trying to sue a class action.
so they have over 000 cases filed in their rights in the last three years?
why didn't he bribe me
i wonder the same thing, but i don't know how patty knew we were setting up tom.
what did you guys find on purcell?
we need to make sure our secret doesn't show up so we can move forward.
it's okay with me.
ellen, i know it's disappointing, but you have to back off.
we'll all retreat.
it might help me.
i have no experience in criminal law.
we must have chased him out before he could find time to steal something.
it was dark the first time.
you know, last night, i was wondering if somebody mistook the houses.
isn't this your job to find out, detective?
let's see if there's anything in the photos that can refresh your
mr. purcell didn't come here to be harassed.
he always did.
this is a very important development, mr. purcell.
you find the ring, you find my wife's killer.
mr. purcell, i believe you.
because the person who killed christine is still out there, and you have absolutely no use for it.
you can't use them against me.
don't answer that.
i can swear you're pretending to be arrested.
the only event that happened three years ago is not probable cause
no, but it's like he's lying about everything.
i mean, two breaks into your house and nothing's been stolen.
isn't the contaminant damaged health?
we spoke on the phone a couple of times, but i guess he still doesn't.
he wants to introduce me to the man he's with
if there's something we need to know, patty will tell us when he feels ready.
whatever you've got the company involved, it's better if nothing else comes out of stolen documents.
if you're wondering what happened to christine purcell, look at the grieving widow.
my only job is to protect mr. kendrick, and if you've done anything to expose him or ultima national resources...
everything okay in new york?
daniel purcell, i'm meeting with patty hewes.
do you have reason to believe that ultima national resources was involved in the murder of your wife?
i've watched many farm animals die these days.
00 years ago, he used daniel purcell as an expert witness, and he won a case.
then why would ibc global's report continue to suggest that 000 parts perm is acceptable?
daniel purcell was a brilliant man, but when he faced patty, he collapsed.
no, this is just another major conspiracy to uncover.
as soon as i tell you what i know about ultima national, you throw me away.
whatever he told you, you can't trust him.
i don't know who killed your wife, but you'll be blamed for it.
and he worked together before purcell ibc global.
six months after purcell's testimony, michael was born.
just the two of
we will encounter unexpected elements.
with a massive attack, we will neutralize them.
on three.
one, two, three.
shoot them!
detective stark?
excuse me.
yeah.
that guy over there.
and did you pull him over on the 00th?
am i sworn?
i'd appreciate it if you would stop asking me that
was mr young the one you pulled over on the 00th?
i don't realize if you don't say it again
what?
do you know what this is, you son of a bitch?
it wasn't a real bomb
"no blood, no crime."
not legally, detective.
even a threat with a bomb is a clear physical threat.
terrible buildup.
i think your shirt is scary.
your honor, we demand the dismissal of the case.
liz, i don't know what to say.
he's your partner, jack.
that's not enough, jack.
we've been trying to catch wayne young for years.
liz, i... liz
jack, what are you gonna say?
i need to be alone.
you want some chips?
no, i don't want chips, dan.
i think they put spices in it.
it feels better.
you fucked the case, dan...
but state's case.
you mean your ex-boyfriend's case?
they're finishing the investigation.
that means no more department income.
department income?
and you would fight crime with sticks?
we need financial resources for research.
you know what?
good luck to you.
you'll see.
good day to you all.
see you in hell.
here it is.
i thought you might remember that.
you're absolutely right.
hey, do you have any nicotine gum with you?
i can't imagine myself without them
because i left those cancer sticks.
that's it.
all right, we need to do some errands.
first, i gotta get myself a shotgun.
you misunderstand!
there's a misunderstanding!
please!
i made a deal while you were in jail.
for both of us.
what kind of deal?
heroin.
near south america.
i put it in one of our trucks.
i have a client.
and this is just the beginning.
if it does, we'll bring more heroin.
wayne, we're so close!
you meet the guy, we make the delivery.
what about the cops?
they won't come after you after the border!
cops can't do anything!
rough day?
yeah.
is this about the girl or business?
you're gonna need a second donut.
hey, dan.
what's up?
of course.
i'll tell liz about it in the morning.
i'll call you back.
freeze!
okay.
okay.
freeze!
i'm not moving!
why are you attacking me?
you're hurting the holy bond.
i have three warrants on me.
being a cop isn't the first thing to do.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
how would you feel if the warrant was removed?
when you say "no resentment"...
"julius, you don't have to go to prison." the lifting?
because it seems to me.
i'm all yours, man.
you can do whatever you want to me.
i want to know about wayne young.
i know that.
i know wayne young.
as you wish?
all i want is a piece of paper, pen and writing... and a piece of
do it.
he has a place in oakwood, okay?
that's it.
does that make us good?
we're gonna put him in prison...
we're good.
okay.
because i want to embrace you.
you can hug me.
all right.
thank you so much, man.
okay.
okay.
what can i do for you, jack?
i was talking to dan... talking
it means everything is according to the book...
not really your partner's style.
actually, i could send him home.
don't worry about it
just give me the information to resist wayne.
okay.
i'll see you at the office at 0:00.
he works in a garage in wayne east dallas.
he works for a company like shell.
but what are we gonna arrest him for?
we'll think of something when we get there.
no, dan.
we'll do a background check.
yeah, that works.
oh... by the
how did you know where wayne was working?
am i still under oath?
this is the address.
hello!
it's weird
what did you say we go in and look at the truck?
what about this one?
are we gonna have to disapprove of him?
they should know security sucks.
besides, nobody gets in here without a helmet.
you mean us?
hey, ours is a violation.
if you don't spend more than $0.00, then
that's why i'm
she's like a
it makes you angry, but it doesn't do anything to calm you down.
everything gets worse.
what is this place?
what are they doing here?
we don't know... we
i have to call liz.
just... just
dan, what are you doing?
dan, we can't be here.
what you did was illegal, dan?
okay?
this truck is full of boxes.
yeah.
boxes full of crime.
come on.
we're over a 00-foot thing.
i can feel the whining in my waist!
another excuse for the report.
listen, dan.
we got off to a bad start here, okay?
did you hear something?
start the car.
i'll close the back.
dan, this is an illegal investigation, okay?
if we get caught, we're in big trouble!
your phone's ringing.
oh, god!
i hate it.
hello.
hello, detective dan.
this is julius, man.
how's our parole deal going?
hey, i can't talk
i'm behind wayne young's truck.
long story.
there's a big man with a
caesar's right to caesar, paco.
looks like things are going well.
you're glad you didn't blow my head off with a shotgun, aren
it was just a little misunderstanding, wasn't
yeah.
let's make some money.
yeah, me too.
shit!
what the hell is that?
thanks for coming.
i die slowly.
you look good.
i'm not okay.
you know the probation i made.
the cop i made the deal was trapped in one of wayne young's trucks.
there's no trucks in there!
i mean, i have a girlfriend in jamaica.
maybe we'll come back here and open a motel
but why am i here?
you'll introduce me to wayne young.
you two are friends, he... he... he's
that's a very deep word.
we're more like colleagues, man.
he wanted me to take weed to the north sometimes, that's all.
skeeter, dear...
you gotta find this truck, and you gotta find it now, man.
look, i'll give you $000.
he's a monster, man!
he cut a guy's thumb in time!
it looked like his fingers were lost!
that's disgusting, dude!
i love this car.
including the sound system?
and the hubcaps?
you can have them, too.
you can have the ashtray, skeeter.
just find the truck for me, okay?
all right, i'll help you find the truck.
i didn't mean to yell at you.
that's the real joke.
they won't examine the entire cargo.
what the hell was that?
don't panic
dan, this is texas, okay?
you just described 00,000 square miles.
god damn it!
then let's break the door so we can jump out.
what's wrong with it?
physics, dan.
it's suicide.
not if you jump fast enough, man.
we're gonna bring the truck down to zero.
come on.
why are you acting like such a bad thing?
we got wayne young right where we want him.
yeah.
he's on a two-blooded highway in a country
exactly.
i'm detective jack bailey.
please leave a message, i'll call you back.
well, it's been 00 minutes
congratulations.
you're officially going the same way with your partner.
still waiting for your girl?
detective bailey's not my girlfriend.
jack.
wherever you are, i hope you're having fun.
all i know is they're somewhere in the south
how are you?
thank you very much
man, what's taking so long?
dude, you asked me to find a criminal, didn't you?
can we just focus, please?
where's the truck with the police?
that way.
so i'm just going this way?
what's gonna happen on
i'm working on the ropes.
dude, you...
i think he had a deal with a man.
dude, you're gonna kill me
you'll definitely kill me.
you know anything else?
i hear he has a scary look.
and he wasn't from this
we can make the deal on thursday.
i'm not british.
i'm from south african.
yeah, there's a giraffe in south africa
see you thursday.
that's it.
coming with you wasn't part of our deal.
hey.
do you want my car or not?
yes, i do.
that's what i thought.
thank you.
good night.
you got some interesting choice of friends, man.
he was wearing these weird boots, man.
i have those boots!
yeah.
what else was i supposed to do?
we're partners, right?
you would have done the same for me.
any other deals?
is there anything i should know?
that's it.
dan, what are you doing?
good luck.
i'll take care of it.
what are you doing?
am i not the kind of person who's trying not to go crazy
apparently.
i haven't opened them all yet.
are you looking for scented specifically?
let me ask you something, dan.
like i said, these boxes are full of crimes.
yeah... ye
think you can help?
this should get a little more light.
mystical sunrise.
natural.
i like that.
don't die on me, dan.
don't die on me, dan.
don't die on me, dan.
dude, will you shut up?
i'm trying to talk on the phone!
yeah.
sort of.
in lubbock, "lill's most antique shop."
i don't know, man
a place like a souvenir shop.
besides... also
oh, god.
i've learned some information about the south american guy.
perfect.
just focus on where the deal's going.
save the moustache.
save the moustache.
the smell of the candles is starting to drown
they smell like mysterious sunrise.
i think i'm gonna throw
i'll light more candles if you puke.
no.
give me that.
at least 0 kilos.
heroin.
it's heroin.
high pure.
small particles.
it's probably asian
wow, you know a lot about heroin.
thank you.
so you're saying you planned this?
i mean, being a cop is a team
and you, jack.
that's how we ended things together.
are you serious?
we call it, sal, then catch him again.
the bad guys only chase the criminal with a gun on their own.
good cops chase criminals with weapons on their hands in a team.
thanks for the career advice.
hey, listen, dan... dan...
what?
the van's stopping.
why are we here so early?
what kind of trouble did you pick a place like this?
this little town is right between the states.
so, 000 miles to the nearest cop.
we don't get caught.
we're not even here.
just in case.
hello.
don't worry about the guys with the
mikkel likes to carry heavy weapons just in case.
i'm not worried.
it's so good to see you.
looks like we're doing a little work.
put the shotgun down.
on your knees.
excuse me?
i said, "get on your feet."
hey, hey, hey, cowboy.
what you did here...
what the hell is going on here?
i'm sorry, wayne.
i made a deal, you son of a bitch!
everybody wins.
exactly.
what?
okay.
okay.
there's no confusion.
how was the meeting?
they're both unbelievable.
we'd better shoot them both and take them.
son of a bitch.
i should have killed you when i had the chance.
enough!
let's finish this.
get the heroin in here and get out.
open the van.
smell that?
come on!
come on!
remember, stick to the plan.
just the two of
we will encounter unexpected elements.
with a massive attack, we will neutralize them.
come on!
what the hell?
do you have a plan "b"?
come on, run!
shoot them!
traitor, son of a bitch!
i don't like the plan "b"!
isn't it a little early for you to visit here,
i heard about the dan stark machinery.
what happened?
it's about detective bailey.
they usually come to hot places.
i found an address on jack's table last night...
hey!
we had a deal!
good day.
looks like you're in a bit of trouble
not as much as it looks
i think we're safe for now.
don't ever say "be safe" again!
let's go!
who are these guys?
i don't know, and i don't
just kill them all and bring me the heroin.
cover me.
i'll call the lieutenant and call for backup.
lieutenant ruiz.
yes, lieutenant!
detective bailey!
you haven't checked in the last six hours.
where the hell are you?
it's a long story, ok
detective stark and i need backup.
send code 0 if you can!
"revenge shop."
lubbock's 00 minutes away.
all right, we're under heavy fire!
it's 0 hours away, detective.
what the hell are you doing there?
long story.
just as many men as you can send, okay?
we're too late, man.
we're too late.
this stupid deal was five minutes ago.
where's the address
there's gotta be somewhere
man, come on.
here?
yeah.
he's back
we just passed.
this isn't a safe ride!
then you can talk about my driving.
backup comes in 00 minutes.
sounds about right.
we gotta get the bad guys on the squad.
we deal with the cavalry on the road.
good idea, dan.
right here.
look!
if we're going to die, it must be in a real car!
you ready?
"let's go."
let's go!
get in the car!
go, go, go, go, go, go.
don't you know how to contact?
what did they teach you at the academy?
go!
go, go, go, go!
son of a bitch
you!
can't you make it go faster?
that had a good engine!
this car is dead!
maybe we should have taken sedan.
you want some?
dan, when did you get that chocolate?
i went back to the store when you were on the phone.
it's almond with almond nut
son of a bitch
i want that heroin!
i don't think it's a very good situation
what, you think i didn't notice?
take it!
come on.
come on!
hang in there
beautiful!
that's exactly what i wanted it to happen.
that's what scares me.
nobody moves.
i think we're completely safe now.
do you see what i see?
looks like a flame truck.
got it!
i dropped it!
get down!
are you okay?
yeah, i'm fine.
but i was better.
yeah.
you bastard!
got it!
he's taking the heroin and running
jack.
partner, we have a bigger problem.
lower your weapons.
where's heroin?
you're lying!
he's not l
we left him in the middle of the road.
"paco" ran off with it.
who are you?
what were you doing behind the truck?
we're officers.
are you a cop?
are you kidding me?
i'm not.
julius!
you did it!
i'll explain later.
can i hold you?
yes, you can.
come on!
okay.
you better get out of here.
register your weapon!
what the hell was that?
we hugged.
i'm a hugger.
it was like a walnut stock.
anyway, he ran down here...
no sign of paco.
what about heroin?
no sign of him either.
looks like he got away with it.
he doesn't have any witness
and wayne young will testify against paco.
and i'm sure he's going to say...
"i'll drag the law into hell with me."
well, that'll do.
yeah, but you know what's not gonna work?
i had no idea i was involved in this.
it just happened.
you came all this way because you were worried about me?
no.
i came all this way to see wayne young arrested.
i'm so sorry, jack.
well, i stole a sports car and set the truck on fire.
did you even think about that?
we're questioning the south african guy.
did you know the giraffes live there?
it's almost fe
dan stole the pure heroin, okay?
it's hard to take as a victory
"i can't say what we're missing.
what do you mean?
don't ever say "be safe" again!
cover me.
i'll call the lieutenant and call for backup.
yes, lieutenant!
i'm detective bailey.
it's a long story, ok
send code 0 if you can!
hey, old man... old
sorry about the fight.
how much for this doorstop?
five dollars.
this is a brick.
it's a hand-p
i'll give you three dollars
okay.
here you go.
three dollars.
how much for the chocolate?
00 cents each.
why did i do that?
i was hungry.
not the chocolate.
what made you change the packages?
well, you said everything would be in the book, right?
yeah.
exactly.
i won't waste your time.
i brought you the best product.
it's the best heroin money can buy.
it'll easily cost $000,000.
wholesale price.
here.
"the alamo memories," huh?
well, listen.
stop.
wayne young was captured within 00 hours and... and... and
all $0.00.
actually, $0.00.
all i have to do is...
like i said, being a cop is teamwork.
but there's not much of it like a desert of water
hunters here spend their lives looking for rare and difficult prey.
000 tonnes of weight is the biggest animal that ever lived through 00 metres long.
despite their great size, the blue whales are the most aerodynamic and energy savings in all swimming animals.
they can travel over 000 miles a day in harts.
it takes a lot of effort to open your giant mouth, so it only happens when you see a rich and dense pack of strain.
the chances of feeding here are often rare.
when it's over, the hunters must continue their constant search.
the frigate birds are pirates of the open sea.
the frigates must be very light because they can't have heavy oils that waterproof the feathers of other sea birds.
small fish try to hide in the one sheltered dead waves of the ocean.
with the extra thrust in their tails, the flying fish can take off more than once.
with a good wind, they can float hundreds of metres.
all open ocean hunters can't go searching for food.
so he can barely swim.
this brunette fish must lie in wait for the ambush between the moss.
in this particular ocean, these quidters will be more demanding for shelter than cub fish.
finally, first opportunity after weeks.
he can only make a move when he's a few inches away
trusting the perfect camouflage, hiding in the moss.
the oceans are so vast that some hunters can only find enough prey by searching for a team.
dolphins live in highly advanced social groups.
they can work together to cover a wide area of the ocean.
small groups sometimes come together to form 0,000 super-dollars.
they use some kind of radar to find their prey.
but these little fish spend most of their time in the depths of the ocean, in the depths of the ocean, where dolphins
they only hunt when they go up to the surface to feed.
when they find a lot, dolphins use their radar for another purpose.
as the dolphins are feeding, they're approaching the gold to prevent their prey from escaping to safety again.
down here, food is much scarcer than at the surface, so the hunters must do everything they can to protect their precious energy.
most of them only drift with lethal needles.
the others, the upside-down hairs often lead to darkness with their impulse power.
beroe's the top jelly predator in deep waters.
beroe's got special kinds of moses like teeth in her mouth to catch the jelat's prey.
this deep inkfish use long sticky tentacles to hunt.
the open ocean may be a vast blue desert, but like every desert, there are savages.
the sea has forced its deep ocean currents upward to the surface of nutrients full of nutrients.
success here depends on delicate manoeuvres.
hiding his tactic in a straight spot... giving his prey a false sense of trust.
the lionfish's stripes are visually confusing, so it's hard to imagine how close it is for their prey.
and the exaggerated fins that he used to hide his slow tail movements are making him even superior.
these deep water currents that give so many residents are also attracting visitors to these savages.
they travel hundreds of miles between the sea they used as a gathering point.
both shark species are travelling between the galapagos and the other seabagos east of the great ocean.
no one knows why they've collected so many, but some certainly come to these savages to look for food.
if these little fish stay close to the lentil, the sharks won't be able to
as long as they keep the silverfish close to the ocean floor, they can avoid predators.
there's never an easy meal in the open
here, exposed to the storm, water creates the nutrients by moving food into the surface to the surface, creating isolated areas.
black browed albatross are the same size as frigate birds, but three times heavy, so he needs a completely different kind of flight.
albatros is a type of bird with the longest wingspan, and that would allow the southern sea winds to benefit from its power.
first, they glide against the wind and use his energy to get high.
then they turn and swarm at the wind, and they get speed
most of the hunting, they spend weeks at sea without ever returning to the land.
because the winds are so strong here, albatrosses can't afford the weight of waterproofing oils.
they can duck dive to a meter so they rely on you to steal the southern ocean to keep their prey up.
like all birds, albatrosses have to hatch on land, but there are very few, very good islands in the southern ocean, which are very crowded.
nearly half a million albatross are coming here every year to raise their young.
adults share parenting duties, coming back to feed their young in a few days.
after the feeding process, it's time to head for the sea
the albatross are so heavy they can only take off where the wind is strong enough.
from the air, the ocean may seem unstable, but under the surface, there's strong currents with constant motion.
these currents are more effective than any other force determined by the distribution of life here.
all the organisms that are dragged across the ocean are bound to these rivers.
they come together to feed on tiny plants and animals and currents, freshly plankton.
the tips on their legs slow their down, and they swim up and down a few tails, swimming up, feeding.
the currents that carry these travel crabs also have a job on the highway for the big predators of the ocean.
with the perfect aerodynamic structure, they can travel the longest distance with minimum effort.
these hunters touch a shuttlecraft between the ocean currents that often meet.
every predator has senses of extraordinary sense of smell that can detect any evidence of the prey.
great shoals are charming for plankton loads.
a sardine pack can be miles long.
it depends on self-defense.
when the attack comes, the sardines move like one body.
each fish instigates its movements immediately, and the entire herd moves on as a match.
even when more sea lions come, they don't seem to break the sardines' coordinated defenses.
the sea lions need to separate a lot of this size to smaller control groups.
but with so few predators the fish still have the advantage.
all the sea lions can do is keep the sardines on the surface and wait for others to join them.
tuna attacks from below, so the sardines cut their way into the deep water.
as the fish tightens, the pack strategy now makes it easier for the hunters.
tons of sardines run out in less than an hour.
the predators disappear into their own path again in the blue.
this blue whale is still searching for food to satisfy its hunger.
because it's so big, the average of 0 tons a day has to be
it's a crowded croquette packed to the surface because of the
this blue whale has finally found what he's been looking for.
a meal big enough to open your big mouth.
the razor pile is hundreds of metres long and low-down.
the whale is targeting the busiest part of the pack, and it's moving along
it takes a lot of effort to swim with a fully expanding throat, and the whale is having a standstill.
as the whales use your tongue to get the water out of your mouth, the criminals are saving up in the hair plates that line
but it takes time to wipe so much water.
the blue whales may not be as agile as the other hunters, but they don't need to
no other predator is more convenient to resign from the messed-up riches that the open oceans provide.
the blue whale is the greatest hunter in all the oceans in
the open oceans created a lot of difficulty with the team.
it's been a two-year mission to accomplish
the team worked with john calambokidis, the world's greatest blue whale expert in the world.
john received vital information from these harmless labels.
part of this research and part of the reason we're working with the filmmakers is that it gives us a unique chance to get us a scientific data match.
that's why we're doing what they're doing underwater, how they're diving, how they're swimming, making any ideas about how they're feeding.
the team's success depends on a good underwater net.
too much lolly and the whale is literally disappearing into the darkness.
we couldn't
the first year was touched by vulnerability and the shooting ended in failure.
second year, sea conditions are better.
blue whales only surface every 0 minutes before diving for 00 minutes.
he's got to keep the boat moving forward to the whale, but he's not
then he must hope that david will go in the water and get close enough to get the whale on record.
this year the water is unusual, but it takes time to keep david in a good position.
after weeks of effort, finally all the elements come together and give david the chance of his life.
it took me too long, too long.
i mean, it was so big, it was like a freight train.
the footage of blue whales underwater is rare, so it's a tremendous success to record a simple swimming whale.
this series is all about hunting, so it's a nice shot, but we need to get some pictures of blue whales eating krill to complete the episode.
and we have to wait for the croquiles to surface.
once a month, maybe twice.
the team is on a promising sign, but it's a rather unpleasant source.
look at those birds in the water!
we'll go take a look.
look at this majesty!
i still don't quite understand what i just saw.
david saw it, turned the camera.
he took a turn, he went up and took a big bite.
they're called blue whales, you see them underwater, bright and brightly cobalt blue come out of the blue of the ocean.
i was upstairs trying to get another image of the krils, and, honestly, the mouth was open one more time.
it was probably less than ten minutes, but no arguments, no doubt, the most glamorous, most amazing thing i've ever seen without question.
it's something that i'll never forget, to share water with a blue whale and observe.
and the opposite.
yeah, that's the one with the unique perspective we'll never see.
with this close cooperation, the team filmed blue whales as never before, and eventually the lives of the ocean's greatest hunter.
you like him!
no, i don't.
every friend i've ever introduced without any exceptions likes her.
it's pathetic, isn'
when mia went away as a exchange student, we made a list of pros and cons, and it helped clarify our feelings.
yes, ethan karamakov...
abigail sent the pros and cons list to the whole school.
look, i'm coming to stay with you for a while.
no, i won't cause any trouble.
i won't stay forever.
okay.
double battement frappe.
and petit battement.
everybody thinks farm is a dangerous place.
relieve.
i know every rabbit hole, broken fence and rusty nail.
and nice sleeves.
no matter where i am, i'm safe.
let your wife in, tara.
and take.
everybody out there.
tara, you can join us.
but the academy is a completely different world.
if you think you know your way, think again.
you'll realize you're in a minefield.
wherever i go back, i see a new trap...
"it smells like christmas...
"her way of eating.
"everything he talks about is true."
could it be worse?
yes, as you ask...
at least i'm not the first minus on your list.
i guess i should be grateful for that.
i'm really sorry, kat.
i didn't want to involve you in my confusion.
believe me, i've worked hard not to feel this way.
here's a good reason.
my brother will break your heart, and when he does, i won't be there to fix the pieces.
i promise i'll stay away from him.
do you think abigail sent it to third graders?
ethan read it.
kill me.
yes, a question for you.
who can tell me what the real meaning of 'pas deux' is?
pas de de deux.
it means mates dance.
but what does it mean beyond french words, metaphorically?
pas de de deux.
two bodies, one soul.
a man and a woman dance with pure and the same emotions.
that's what we learned today.
i've never danced with a man before.
right.
at home, girls danced with girls.
there wasn't
it's just the cute creatures that smash their fingers in
pas de deux has three important rules.
trust.
throw it at someone
unity.
wonder wonder wonder
and, most important of all, communication.
without these, yes...
ethan, isabelle, it's very nice of you to
remember, in order to be together, you have to trust and communicate.
do your hands always work like this?
i'm allergic to you.
focus on who you're dancing with.
no one else should matter.
you want to drop it?
relax.
you're doing pretty good.
what a great class?
i mean, patrick's such a wonderful teacher.
don't you think the universe is trying to put us together?
la-la-la-la-la.
before you go, i talked to miss raine that you and i wouldn't be lecturing for the rest of
don't get excited.
instead, you will exercise for me.
remember, as you are in other classes, you will be judged without the exercise.
that was a blow!
i'll be walking a dog blindfold.
at least you don't have to spend 00 hours with abigail like me.
i'd rather rip my eyes off with a blind blade.
i know we'll ask our wives 00 questions in 00 hours.
this one?
"one of you can ask each other any questions.
"but you must answer honestly."
like i want to know something about christian.
so you're not alone.
i'm a bowler, my favorite food is a pizza, a lucky number, and we're done.
i know everything about you.
your entire school is being broadcast live.
where are you going?
the beach.
i love this town.
i want to control it too.
i'm going to go find christian.
we'll be there, checking the pretty girls.
great!
oh, i'm beginning to like this report.
are you a slayer or something?
so where did you grow up?
a suburban.
by the beach?
you're lucky
you think i'm rich?
do you have a brother or sister?
he lives in broken hill.
i mean, are you emotionally close?
so, it's made of flesh and blood.
he's doing something.
you have to answer.
says who?
rules.
how far did you go with a guy?
there's first base.
and there's second base.
anybody in your city?
have you ever kissed a man?
you didn't kiss, did you?
maybe i can help you.
maybe you can get out of my sight.
hey, there were questions i'd like to ask
and here i am trying to strengthen my stomach.
we can do these on the beach.
i won't come to the beach
you allergic to fresh air?
i don't like sand, i don't like salt and i don't like sun.
great.
i need water.
me too.
we hate you enough to ask you to die of thirst.
i don't care what his favorite color or his family do.
so did he say anything to you?
he did it!
"oh, let's go to the beach for homework.
"it'll be so much fun!"
i didn't know he'd be here
really.
what are you doing here?
we come to ourselves as third graders.
you shouldn't be bitching here right now.
you can play with us if you want.
i may be blindfolded, but i'
come on, it's just football.
whoo!
are you coming, tara?
i think i'm staying.
i haven't finished my homework with christian yet.
come on, we're out of here.
you know, in this scenario, it's in the toilets
you can hold it.
no, i can't hold it for 00 hours
i'm starving.
yeah, me too.
i'm gonna
i'm gonna go get some food.
this place is closed for smoking.
find another toilet.
why do men's room have to smell so bad?
why do you have to be so bad?
that's right.
they stink.
that was more crime and more than you had.
think about it and finish quickly before we both die of oxygenlessness.
i can't, can you please sing a song or something?
hurry up.
i still don't understand why you sent that list to everyone.
you're as uncomfortable as a fliesy fly.
it just made you look bad.
okay, don't say anything.
there you go.
hey, where's tara
i don't know.
huh.
whoa!
hey, baby.
i've got plenty of room in my lap.
hey!
i wrote that, princess!
come on, we'll catch them later.
you want to die?
didn't you see what they were trying to do to me?
you can't fight around here.
anyway, what are you still doing here?
if you want to know, i was waiting for the bus.
what did you see me in a limo?
you don't know anything about me.
i don't think i want to know.
i've never met anyone as rude as you.
didn't your mother teach you manners?
he's dead
look, if you're curious, all you have to do is call.
who said i was curious?
i'm just checking my messages.
what do you know?
i can understand anything.
this communication thing must be working.
yeah?
can you see that?
ow.
i can't imagine what it means to lose your mother.
no, you can't.
was he dancing?
yes, he was young.
is that why you wanted to get into the academy?
you're leaving?
i won't.
i don't believe you.
i saw you dance!
right.
he lives in broken hill.
very good.
and let's say i got into trouble.
i don't know, probably
you said you were close.
so you're saying he answered, right?
brothers help their brothers.
maybe until you call her.
but the room opens when you call another number, so she doesn't know it was me.
now you know everything.
right or wrong?
i'd like to say wrong, but...
see, you learned nothing.
my brother and i are very close.
i have one question left.
question 00.
ask him.
why did you tell everyone i was dressed in the wrong dressing room?
you knew it was an accident.
why would i even bother?
i don't believe you still lie about it.
i know you did.
you know, i wasn't the only guy there.
have you thought about it?
tara, what were you thinking?
do you think...?
do you think it says 0-0 or 00 here?
two and four hours.
you want to know why i'm bad with tara?
because you three are so stupid!
i need to talk to you.
like you don't know.
you've been laughing behind me all this time, haven't
excuse me?
during the audition week... you told everyone i was in the wrong locker room.
it was you, wasn't it
come on, admit it was funny.
and leaving me on the beach alone?
it's fun, isn't
but you weren't with us.
didn't you answer my pros and cons list?
i didn't realize i needed an answer.
of course you were supposed to.
because of you, the whole school is laughing
why should it be because of me?
look, if you want to hear the truth, i'm ashamed of that list.
i mean, we've only talked to you three or four times, right?
and you went and wrote every feeling and sent it to the whole school.
i don't even know you.
tara?
tara?
he can't talk to you.
yes, he can.
i thought you were sick of girls coming to you after ethan.
because i hate seeing my friends upset.
growing up, my parents warned me of all dangers.
we have to realize them all here ourselves...
prove to me yesterday's paper wasn't a waste of time
good work, boys.
whether we like it or not, we're tied to ropes that won't cut off next year.
so there's a long way ahead of us.
good morning.
good morning, bette.
uh-huh.
get dressed.
i want to be there when they open it.
okay.
i already threw a sugar.
one is enough.
here's your napkin.
you want butter?
here you go.
good morning.
be careful.
the inspector's
good morning, mrs. tremont.
good morning, mr korman.
mr. tremont.
hey.
yeah.
what can i do for you, mrs. tremont?
it says here the pork chop sold.
in the meantime, all of what you saw was in the ad.
how are those pork chops?
we don't sell them.
the ad just says pork chops, mr korman.
no pictures or id numbers.
so what do you want, mrs. tremont?
i want these ribs off that price.
got it.
jake.
hey!
jake.
ah... ah
well, i'm sorry this is up to you, john, but we have a staff problem you should know about.
this guy we're gonna get doesn't decide between us and goldman.
i know you hate this, but you have to step in here and use your magic touch.
is the guy that good?
let's not kidnap this guy
these kids from work school think they're worth $000,000 a week when they work.
i hate your attitude.
okay, set this up with kathy for the weekend.
i got notes for the next few days.
the vale project has given us a lot of directions, but management is resisting our suggestions that we provide information to help investors understand why the company is so profitable.
they don't want to give so much information to their compet
i don't know why we have to cooperate with this vale guy.
a dark type.
we're risking the company's reputation.
if we refuse him, we'll never get business from him again
there's a huge fee, and the banking department wants it.
i'm worried about my wife's share this year.
lower your price.
i think it's the soonest concern i've ever recorded about the relay.
yeah?
your sister's on the line, mr. tremont.
he says it's important.
she needs to talk to you now.
i'm in a
john, this is about our mother.
he had a heart attack
he's fine now, but he's
can you come?
hey!
how was your flight?
it was good.
the guy next to me didn't leave me alone.
he heard i was on wall street, so don't ask.
"how are the stock options?
i see.
you ever hear of a stock called chrometex?
mario.
seriously, someone in the math department told me about it.
they produce heat sensors for low temperatures capsules.
it'll be bigger than the
it won't
no?
no.
good.
at home with your father.
home or the hospital first?
it doesn't matter
let's go to the hospital.
i thought so.
how's dad
to be honest, johnny, he was a little shaken up.
that's why annie's staying
she doesn't want him to be alone
how's mom?
how serious is he?
he can't admit he actually had a heart attack.
he's lying there because of a heart attack, and he's claiming he's indigestion
he blames me.
what do you mean?
he says it's because of the sausages i made for dinner.
he claims i tried to kill him.
did you do it?
no jury can blame me, john.
i believe you.
if you're here, i'm pretty sick.
look, mom, that's why you're the best.
a lot of guilt in your case.
how are you?
are you in pain?
i'm alive because of my will.
he'll tell you.
i have the willpower of a woman half my age.
don't throw yourself in the
did you see your father?
no, i came straight from the airport.
if you see him, don't say anything about a heart attack
just tell me something's wrong with me.
okay?
mom.
listen to me.
just tell her something's wrong with me.
she'll think i'm sleeping because of my uterus.
okay.
if you have to eat outside, go to mcdonald's or wendy's.
somewhere simple.
mom, you shouldn't worry about dad right now.
i think you should think about yourself right now.
you had a heart attack.
i'm not sure i had a heart attack.
that hurts me more like gas pains.
mom, if it was gas pains, they'd drug you with acid travelers.
they wouldn't hook you up to $00 million worth of
did you see the doctor who took care of me?
because i don't believe he's a real doctor.
he was wearing tight pants with a big silver belt buckle.
he can't be more than 00 years
they now graduate everybody from medical school.
john!
god, good to see you.
you came and saw your mother first, huh?
yeah.
how was she looking at you, john, telling the truth
like my mother.
it was like he was gonna drag the serum bottles out of there.
i mean, it's just gas pains.
i'm sure that's what he told
and the willpower?
like a woman half her age.
you look so modern.
where shall i put your bags, sir?
ah, put it there for me.
thank you very much.
no luggage in the living room.
you know the rules.
i take them out to your old bedroom.
is the living room still off-limits?
you're kidding.
this place looks exactly like the smithson's.
dad's out there, huh
yeah, in the green house.
what's he doing there?
mario said he was hardly accepted.
he's scared, john.
he's really scared.
i'm not so sure you understand what's going on with him.
what do you mean?
she saw him, didn't she?
i didn't want to drag him there.
i told him no visitors were accepted, and he seemed to understand that.
hello, dad.
hello, john.
good to see you.
you look good.
good to see you too.
i'll stay here a few days.
did you hear what happened to your mother?
how is he?
good.
good.
he asked me to say hello and he said he'd be home soon.
something's wrong with your body, isn't it?
something like that.
the radiator doesn't work well in your old room, you know.
you should use a second blanket.
okay.
as long as you're here, the most important thing is to make sure everything goes well.
your mother has a calendar, and her life is a really long routine.
and a sugar.
they cut coupons in the morning, make a shopping list.
this is important.
i wrote you a list of pills.
when did he get so bad?
i haven't seen him in a year.
no, you're wrong.
what are you saying?
i was here for christmas.
annie, i need to know that.
okay, i saw him two years ago.
a lot happens in two years.
why didn't you tell me?
i tried to take him to us, but he wasn't comfort
we both work all day.
but there's the garden and greenhouse here.
he knows the environment.
i can only stay here a few days.
what do we do then?
can't you stay longer?
i have to go to boston.
no way.
we gotta get somebody home.
but we have to find the right person.
my father is old, john.
yeah.
come on, dad, let's hit the head, huh
johnny.
i can't find my pyjamas.
i don't know where your mother put them.
here you go.
why don't you put them on, dad
i will.
are you okay?
i miss your mom.
he'll get what he needs.
a good rest.
she'll be home soon.
good night.
good night.
keep the hall lights on.
okay.
sleep tight.
i don't eat much in the morning, johnny.
it was good, though.
thanks, dad.
you do a lot of cooking at home, don't
not really.
i've been eating out since sara and i divorced.
yeah, she was a nice girl.
still is.
how's billy?
he's in santa cruz.
freshman in college.
she came to visit once.
so you've seen him more than i have.
look at him, johnnie.
it's double coupon day at ralph's.
two cans of tuna for $0.00.
amazing.
how much is a tuna fish in new york?
it's not $0.00, i'll bet
no, i disagree.
no way.
listen, dad, i want to talk to you for a minute about mom.
there's something you need to understand.
my mother is sick.
it's not cancer, is it
no, no, it's not cancer.
it kills cancer, you know.
your uncle ben had five operations.
nothing was done to him.
i'm telling you, if you get cancer, you should pack your bags.
look, it's not cancer.
a heart attack.
will he be all right?
yeah, he's gonna be
but he won't work as hard as he used
he'll have to learn to take it easy, and you have to help him with that.
i keep telling him you work too hard.
johnny, he works hard.
you need to learn a few things you can do at home.
hey, mom made you believe no one else could look after you.
we'll try to fix that wrong.
i got it, johnny.
i'll learn how to do all this.
you'll see.
we're gonna make fun of him
okay, dad, the first thing we need to do first, let'
" separate the colored from the whites."
so the dark matter doesn't mix with white colors.
copy that.
i think that's what your mother would do.
now we know we're on the right track.
okay, let's start with the colors, okay?
they're col
color.
white, color, color.
white.
color.
color.
and this?
him?
he's white
okay, this is color.
dad, he must be one of these.
i think we should call your mom.
i'm gonna run a business here.
okay.
what do you think we got?
"e, normal.
i'm trying "normal."
what kind of water should we use?
"cuk-cuk, cold-hot, warm-foot, warm, warm-foot."
what the hell is that?
hot-hot.
i think he was white.
thursday should be ready.
yeah.
what's the easiest way to get to the store from here,
i don't really know these streets, john.
your mother will take us anywhere we have to go.
you never drive?
nothing?
i can't
my license expired a few years ago.
you didn't get another driver's license?
well, they wanted me to take a test because of my age.
you failed the test?
i didn't take the test.
i was afraid i wouldn't pass.
what are you saying?
you used a hell of a car.
johnny, a good driver knows when he can't drive, that's all.
i couldn't remember what you liked, so i got less than anything.
great.
well... well...
these are beautiful.
i want to see your mom, johnny.
i don't think that's a good idea right now, dad
i mean, my mom's fine, but they wouldn't want to accept visitors.
i'm her husband.
i need to see him.
that's not true
perfect.
he made me breakfast this morning.
no, i'm not serious.
i don't know, he built a box.
yeah.
everything's fine.
okay, bye-bye
okay, dad
annie's meeting with the people at the
or he thinks they can let you see him in a day or two.
good.
yeah.
what?
i can do the dishes.
i coded these cards by color.
there's a different code card here for the housework.
like, now, the pink ones are for washing dishes.
go ahead, take a look and see the number has escaped.
number one: number
"fill it with water."
okay.
number two?
"take some soap soap."
okay.
"put dishes in soap water."
i made these for you to work on your own.
these are great, johnny.
if i follow these cards, there's no reason for me to make a mistake.
i'll watch these.
i'll show you how to burn the stove, dad.
no, on the other hand, the stove is off-limits for now
no january.
and stay away from that blender...
no flapping.
i think i should work with this.
your mom wouldn't want me to wear this.
i look so rude.
like johnny cash.
you don't think that when you put this on, do you?
no, dad, i don't think
don't take your guns into town, son.
leave those guns at home.
bang, bang.
"fill the drain." "
professional floor waxed, dad.
you can see yourself on the floor.
no sign of cila sarumasm.
you know what i think?
i think we should reward ourselves.
what do you mean?
let's go out and have a good time.
what are you saying?
okay.
okay.
what do you and mom do here for fun?
"i" 00 "i"
"i" two-zero.
"o" 00. 00.
seven-five.
"b" 00."
"b" one-one.
on top, all right?
"g" 00g
"g" five-eight.
are you kidding me?
does the air conditioning work here, dad?
or a fan or something?
"i" 00..... 00...
choo-choo!
i love it when they do that.
do they always do?
"b" 0."
and after!
boy, tonight is so much fun.
"i" 00 "i"
bingo!
bingo!
jake tremont, is that you?
hal mccarthy.
how are you?

my son, john.
he's visiting from new york.

no, she's in the hospital
that's good to hear.

he's dead
well, good to see you again.
it's been a while.
a long time.
nice to meet you.
they're like fresh air.
i know their bingo too.
haven't you been here long, dad?
when was the last time you played here?
it's been three
you're kidding.
why did you stop coming?
i don't
we used to have so much fun here with your mother, more than anybody, but...
we don't do what we love anymore.
and i don't know why.
i think you should remember what you enjoyed and start doing them again.
that's a good idea.
john, i'm gonna write this
i'll make a list of the things we enjoyed.
yes, sir.
bingo.
what?
i think you've bingo.
hey, i got bingom!
i was worried about you, john.
i'm afraid you'll have an add
we should take a look at this.
we can win, and we can get regular profits.
i know a kid in new york, let me consult him.
he's great with numbers.
he'll build a system for us.
you'll see.
we're gonna beat these guys, d
sorry, i didn't want to leave you so late.
it's like new year's eve.
the only thing missing is guy lombardo.
he's dead
surprised hal mccarthy didn't mention that.
big day tomorrow.
let's go to bed.
good night, john.
good night, dad.
"b" 0."
and then.
there they are, dad.
hello, dad.
you're kidding me.
are you ready to see him, dad?
i can't believe my dad looks so good.
you think so?
thanks to you, john.
i'm fine with him.
it was fun.
listen, i hired someone to take care of the house.
he'll be back in a day
i can stay home until mom gets home.
really?
yeah, no problem.
hey, bette.
are you okay?
uh-huh.
are you taking blood pressure pills?
are you eating?
yeah, i'm fine, bette.
i can make my own bed.
and i wash dishes.
john teaches me to cook.
she's like a real wife.
just keep him alive until i get back.
thanks for the tip.
mom looks good, doesn't she?
yeah, great.
i can't go anywhere without my tubes.
i meant the color of your face, mom.
my color?
what are you, a decorator?
don't call me mom.
do i call you son?
don't be so nice to my mom, mario
you'll kill him.
why are you cooking?
there was food in the fridge.
i told you.
we just wanted a little change, that's all
we had salmon last night.
we had coq au vin the night before.
your father doesn't like foreign food.
just chicken with red wine.
he shouldn't drink red wine.
mom, that was it.
i don't want her to turn into an alcoholic while i
nobody's an alcoholic who eats coq au vin.
easy, bette.
don't worry about everything.
just focus on getting better and don't worry about me.
you sure you want to come, dad?
it's gonna be a
no, i will.
good for me.
i can get you lunch here and you can watch a movie.
i'll sit down, read a magazine.
i'll be fine.
okay.
john tremont to see vic walton, please.
he's expecting you.
dad, are you gonna be comfortable here with all this repairs?
yeah, nobody's gonna drop anything on me.
john, good to see you.
sorry for the confusion.
good to see you too, vic.
this is my father, jake tremont.
dad, this is vic walton.
nice to meet you, mr. tremont.
me too.
can we be here in an hour?
like i said.
okay, well, take care, dad.
wait a minute.
we can't leave your father here.
come on, mr. tremont, why don't you come in and sit with us?
i don't think
ralph, we've given you every benefit of the doubt, and now our guess is 00% less than yours.
how can you be so confident?
you-you've never followed a job like this before.
and if you're wrong, we'll be the laughing stock and we'll never be able to do business with you again.
forget about running the cannery.
he loses money every minute he's left, but the land on him is worth at least $00 million.
how can you be so sure of $00 million?
we could put some on for $00 million.
do you have any backup?
can i get back to the point now?
we don't have a problem with all the moving around $00 million.
they can handle all over the overhead, but our plan shows that we need to eliminate 00% of the executive staff in a few months.
isn't it enough just to sell
that way the accounting records are done.
if this goes well, you won't have to.
i don't think they're focusing on
we can change that.
the other stuff about the food wholesale sales is a good sector this far.
now, our cash flowing plans for our department seems to be compromised, but it's not satisfying.
when we consider everything, we have no problem getting credit from the banks.
yeah, that looks good.
johnny, what's going on out there?
well, we're gonna get a salmon fish canned, dad.
i didn't know you knew about something like this.
actually, i don't know.
the guy who came to us for money doesn't know about
we're just gonna get the company and then we're gonna put an end
is this your job?
you buy companies, then close them?
my work is a little complicated, dad.
we're taking this canned factory.
then the company becomes terrible.
this third generation is taking over, and its production is horrible.
but they have a small fraud companies, and that's the skiing.
the factory is built on a land that's worthy
so we buy the factory, close it, then we take over the shell company, then we sell the land.
and you never thought to run these companies?
there's no money in that, dad
the world has changed, johnny.
you can't believe how the world has changed.
when you were a little kid, you used to go work with me to lockeheed, remember?
i used to cut out the shells and touch them.
they'd give me 00 cents a day, and i'd buy those ham-and-cheese sandw
when you grew up, you said you wanted to work there with me.
but what you do now is buy and then turn it off.
you hear about those men from locheed, dad?
rick malinson?
tommy williams?
they all moved away.
the valley, palm springs... the palm springs...
there was nobody there to say goodbye to me
the next morning, there was nobody doing my job.
the world split into two groups:
...workers and bosses.
i don't know, dad, i
everything's fine, johnny.
there's nothing wrong here.
i'm a worker, that's all.
but you're different.
you like being in control.
you like responsibility.
you're a boss.
mom?
what do you think?
yes, father.
"if you hit a parked vehicle and don't find the owner...
why are you doing this?
i've already passed the written test.
i know, but you may not be too careful.
a lot of the samples here could be on the driver's test.
i want to prepare you for this.
very good.
thank you.
we've come this far.
i don't want to see anything go wrong now.
they want us to pull over here.
go.
slow, slow down, not so fast.
okay, stop.
there he is.
jake tremont?
actually, it's jake tremont.
i'm his son, john.
i guess you didn't have to know that, but you heard.
you can't sit here during the test, sir.
oh, i'm sorry.
oh, you can't stay in the car.
what are you talking about?
this is my father.
that's the rules
i won't test you as long as you sit in the car.
either you take it off now, or your father is a failure to test.
everything okay?
it'll be okay if you
as you walked out of your car parked-- traffic
john?
i'm leaving
i'll check the bikes and other vehicles
yes!
while waiting on the left turn, give priority to the vehicles from the square.
make sure all vehicles can be dangerous.
yes!
oh, look who's here.
hey, dad
hey, billy.
hey...
my grandma was sick.
i just ran.
i thought you might need me, grandpa.
don't even think about helping your grandfather.
when was the last time you had lunch?
why are you americans so obsessed with food?
you know, when in rome...
what were you doing in mexico?
semester break.
some of my friends are there.
dad, you say that every time we meet.
and i haven't grown in two years.
how's your mother
good.
third year of law and class number one.
if your mom's taking more notes than you, it's embarrassing, but we work.
send my love.
how are you?
sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
if i know you, you win more than you lose.
if you're finished, you wax a piece of cake.
he looks so good.
what's going on?
well, we spend a lot of time together.
good time, huh?
they say this is very good for parents and children.
maybe you and i should spend more time together.
this place looks great, grandpa.
too much.
you look well.
i'll give you a name after that, bill.
butter, anyone?
you want some butter, honey?
i want to make a toast.
aha.
a lot has happened in the last two weeks.
we've overcome some challenges, some pain.
we had them all as a team.
it's time for thanks.
it was great, mario.
this is my usual conversation.
actually, i just wanted to say how nice to see our family together and happy.
my chicken's getting cold.
it's over
very good.
i'm having a toast.
hmm.
wow, dad.
to my lovely bride.
your bride?
have you had a drink today, jake?
before you came, mother, we drank two glasses of 'coq au vin'.
to my loving bride...
bette, welcome back to our family, where you belong.
it's so good to be
listen, listen.
nice talking to you, dad
it's nice to have everybody here
and i don't remember the last time we were together with john billy.
billy looks good.
i like that jar.
should i wear it?
i have a needle waking up if you want.
oh, leave him alone, mom.
looks great.
i bet the girls will jump on you.
don't worry about me.
it's not embarrassing.
the dorms are boys.
is that right?
yeah, our dorm is full of girls.
i'm glad it wasn't like this in
if that were the case, i wouldn't
like you're a student to me.
mario was a great student, mom.
he graduated physics.
he didn't even read, he finished a diabetic.
yeah, but all the good students read the book at the same time as me and ended a diabetic shock.
but john was a good student.
thank you, mommy.
every friday we went from the nest to the library.
we used to buy 0 books.
you read them, we'd give them back, then we'd get four new books.
you did more than that.
so how did it work?
were the girls on the other floor?
somebody shut him up.
i'm just happy
let's make things easier for grandma and grandpa while you're here.
of course, you're used to hearing it, but you can't believe it's real.
i do, believe me.
my fillings are still ringing.
i'm sorry.
so when do you have to get back to school?
i'm not going back to school.
i'm thinking of hanging out in mexico for a while.
what's the joke of mexico?
all mexicans try to get here.
did you know that?
there are some kids from school.
they have very similar directions.
that's, uh, that'
yeah, it's fun, but believe it or not, you're gonna want to work one day, bill.
laying on the beach in mexico isn't gonna do you any
if you don't want to be a mariachi singer, you have to finish a school no matter what.
i would say i went to college.
i got the phd.
i did the right thing.
two phds.
one chemistry, one in physics.
i'll be back in new york soon, and i want to make this right.
what does your mother think?
he thinks i can make my own decision.
i'm not sure how i feel about this.
we need to talk more about it.
i don't understand why.
we haven't talked about it until now, and i know what i want.
johnny, something's wrong.
can you come here and take a look?
that's enough, mr. tremont.
you can get dressed if you want.
is he okay?
yeah, good.
a difficult process begins.
it hasn't spread yet
what do you think is the problem?
it could be one of a few things
i suspect there are ranchers in the bladder.
the problem is whether he's got a good heart
will this come out in your tests?
not entirely.
it's not a good sign to ble
so it's serious?
i think we should get him through a general operation.
if it was serious, dad, they wouldn't leave you.
they'd open it up and operate under the spot.
i wouldn't be surprised if it was just a
i don't think we should tell mom about this.
why worry if there's nothing out there?
whatever you say, johnny.
you're the boss.
he told you, didn't he?
of course he did.
then you know there's nothing serious.
if it's not serious, you should have told me that yourself.
look, mom, you need to stay out of any possible stress right now.
you'll be sorry for nothing.
that's why i didn't tell you
he says it's just a cyst.
that's right
it's going to be a simple
yes, it is.
mom, if anything went wrong, i'd tell you.
make sure.
okay.
am i going to walk around here, john, like all the nurses here?
yeah.
that's what it says in your acceptance
"not today."
get down.
you need to sign this, dad.
what is this?
i don't have any baseball gloves.
bad joke.
dr. santana prepared these meds.
it'll only help relax you.
if you have too much, i'll drink a piece.
he was paid extra for his room.
what time is it
it's evening
isn't it late yet
no.
are you comfortable, dad?
i'm fine.
let me get some rest.
this thing will put you to sleep like a baby.
okay.
remember, if you need anything, just ring that bell.
that's it,
you'll be fine.
you know, john, i see some guys, they hug each other.
we never hugged.
shall we try?
come on.
i love you, johnny.
i love you too, dad.
okay, mr. tremont, i'm afraid
cancer.
we ran into a couple of malignant tumors.
your father won't be with anybody his
well, it's a silly question, but are you absolutely sure about that?
yeah.
the good thing is we can reach him and destroy him.
listen, dr. santana.
whatever you do, don't tell my father you have cancer.
he's very agitated, and he's terrified
say something more reasonable.
calm down, mr. tremont.
you'd be surprised what the others went through.
they don't even care about the kids.
i'm not taking this lightly, doctor.
i just want to tell him myself, that's all.
it's cancer, isn'
mom, i told you.
it's just a cyst and they'll take
i want to see him.
mom!
mom, you can't see him right now.
will you listen to me?
you shouldn't be subjected to this kind of stress.
if everything is all right let me see him.
oh, come on, mom!
john only wants what's best for you.
you know.
you should listen to him, mom.
he's my husband and i'll see him.
now you take me there, or i walk, but i'm leaving.
what's in there
billy, go find dr. santana fast.
come on!
get out of here.
what happened to him?
jake, it's me
why didn't he know me
jake!
mr. tremont, this is dr. santana.
do you know who i am?
i'm fine.
i'm fine now, thank you.
give me a 00-g libium im and check every two hours.
yes, doctor.
this is exactly the same as the other patients.
they often go into shock after simple operations.
is that standard?
do you know what's going on in there?
i know this is a terrible experience for you, but what you need to understand is a crisis here.
he wasn't senile when
why now?
dementia is a strange thing.
and he comes and goes
a stress like that can suddenly happen.
i'm sure she'll be fine with fine rest and medication.
what are we gonna do, by the way
nothing.
what do you mean "nothing"?
we'll wait for him to answer the drug.
did you tell dad you had cancer?
he has the right to know that.
i don't know exactly what you want from me, mr. tremont.
dr ethridge, dr ethridge,
i don't trust santana.
you're the hospital director, and i just want to say that it's not comforting us.
dr. santana is a fine young surgeon.
he seems to be perfect and professional about your father.
i told my father never to tell him he had cancer, because he's too scared of that word.
but what he did, he just left and told him.
yeah, that's hard for any doctor.
he has to balance the balance in the rights of your father's knowledge with the family members.
i'm sure he had no choice.
he had a choice.
he should have listened to me.
i know my father.
why did you tie his arms?
so he wouldn't hurt
he was hitting himself with his hands
well, i'm his son, and i don't think he needs them.
let us know when you're ready, and we'll put him down.
i can't believe it.
hey, dad, how's it
does he always look like this?
look, hey, look, look, i brought annie.
and billy's here.
hey, dad
how are you feeling, dad?
can you hear me?
hey, grandpa, it's me, billy.
how's it going
god, john, i can't stand being here looking like that.
i think that's enough.
i gave him a privilege.
it'll calm him down.
how long has he been like this?
all the time we've been here.
he seemed depressed?
oh, god, doctor.
i'm glad you're not a detect
yeah, he seemed depressed.
what the hell is going on here?
i meant anything unusual, mr. tremont.
mr. tremont- mr.
don't keep telling me it's common, doc.
this extraordinary depression is not unusual, it's true, but the sedative will bring him to himself.
sedative?
he's hallucinating.
he keeps screaming.
he doesn't know any family, and you just gave him a sedative?
why didn't you give him some cake?
maybe his throat hurts too!
we decided to release your father tomorrow.
you can pick him up after 00:00.
what do you mean, "aburu"?
you want to tell me my father is feeling better?
well, of course not, but medically speaking there's nothing we can do for him.
we can't keep the beds for patients we can't help from the medical road in vain.
how do we know?
he didn't get any medical help!
what exactly do you mean?
that's what i said.
so they don't care if he's dead.
what kind of talk is that?
i didn't think--
just calm down.
you want my father out of here?
look what i'll do.
i'll do better than you can.
it's clear you can't look at him.
john, what are you doing?
mr. tremont- don't touch him.
that's not necessary.
i'm saying i'll take him home.
mr. tremont, what you're doing is so unhealthy
what do we do now?
i don't
we don't have much choice but we-
no, i don't want to do that
i don't want to take him to a home of
me too, john, but we have to do something.
hold on a second, john.
you can't help him in this situation.
i think i can do that.
i'll do better than the hospital can.
i'll stay and help.
no.
why not?
i'll look after him.
he's my father.
well, he's my grandfather.
i'm your father.
i don't want you here right now, billy.
you shouldn't see this.
dad, i'm not a kid
look, i think you should go.
go back to school, go back to mexico.
you're from here.
don't you get it?
yeah, i got it.
i want to talk to him.
i don't think that's such a good idea right now, mom, really.
annie's right, mom.
here's to the hearse.
you'd like that, wouldn't you, mario
i mean, get in the car, mom.
it was just a slip of tongue.
he'll be fine.
john will take care of her.
let's go, dad.
this gooden kid is awesome, isn't he
the style reminds me of bob gibson.
you know, a real player.
did you get it, dad?
good.
here we go.
the mines.
we're gonna have to work on your technique.
okay.
what you need is a little home cooking.
well, i think he's right.
wait till you taste this.
come on, dad.
okay.
hmm, okay.
here.
try this.
come on, dad, take a bite.
come on, here we go.
let's take our chances.
dad, the glass doesn't bite.
house rules.
you don't like it there, do you?
neither did i.
we're gonna be okay, huh
come on, dad.
that's better.
okay, dad
hold on a minute and i'll put you to bed.
i'll get these in place.
why are we here, ed?
why aren't we on the farm?
what?
you know, they'll wonder if we stay, you know.
where's the owner
this is your home, dad.
what are you talking about?
mandy didn't come back from the meadow,
i'm worried about him.
well, don't worry, dad
i-i'm sure he's fine.
you think so?
yeah.
i need 00 nails for the hen, so help me.
it has to be done
look.
what we need right now is a good night's sleep.
don't you always say when there's always a
"let's get down on it."
i mean, we have problems right now, dad.
let's go to bed.
dad?
dad?
dad?
dad, where are you?
dad?
dad?
dad?
dad?
what the hell are you doing here?
oh, dad, come on, let me help you.
come on, dad, come on.
no.
dad, i'm gonna take the
come on out.
come on, dad, get out
dad, come on.
i got you.
shh.
come on.
shh.
i got you, i got you.
i got you.
mr. tremont?
i understand you brought your father back to the hospital.
yeah.
i thought it'd be hard for you to look at her at home.
that's no place for him right now.
he can't do it at home, he can't do it here,
maybe he'd better go for a helicopter on top.
it's difficult for kids to admit their parents are getting older, i know.
what that means.
i know what it's like to get old
mr. tremont, you don't forget that doctors are human
we can't handle all the problems.
we can't save every patient.
we live in a system where old people get hard at the end.
what is it you want?
why are you here?
there's another doctor in this hospital.
i think he can do better than dr. santana.
what?
i'm kicking everything they say.
he's a good man.
i want him to take a look at your father.
mr. tremont?
mr. tremont?
how are you, mr. tremont?
let's do a few tests.
let's get an eeg and we'll identify their metabolic disorder.
give us calcium-magnonnaise and run vital functions.
i'm not so sure what caused it, but right now, my diagnosis is a epilepsy.
the question is, what caused it?
and why is she unconscious?
if you want to have any more consultations about this, please do it.
no, that's not necessary.
well, like we said, don't sit around and think we're not gonna do anything.
we don't think so.
we've done a series of tests so far and we'll do more.
all we've ever done is shoot darkness.
i appreciate your modesty, doctor.
but those tests were done a long time ago, right?
he'll be here for a while, so we'll watch him from the monitor every minute.
and i'll check and visit him twice a day.
i won't leave her alone until she's well.
i'm afraid that's completely against hospital regulations.
how long can you stand it?
i don't
i'm going once a day.
i'm sitting.
i'm talking to him
i'm talking to what's
if i sit there and talk, i think he won't die.
what if he dies?
annie, i don't-
you're the only one who can't accept it, john
why don't you let him go?
i can't explain that to you.
maybe i should be there when his end is over.
i don't
to prove he's still here.
to prove i was his son.
so, what have you done positive so far?
annie, this guy's gone to work that he's never liked.
we never asked him.
he did it because he was the father and he had no choice.
he never asked himself if i was happy or happy.
he didn't even know if he had the right
as a result of this election, we should look at it and take care of it.
but i messed it up.
john.
i'm embarrassed to him, but my mother took over.
she's getting old right now.
i'm embarrassed because i have a marriage that goes bad, a job that doesn't make sense, and i have a son on the street who will barely recognize it.
maybe this is gonna be hard for me
but i'll be there when you die.
and i'm gonna kiss him, and i'm gonna cover him, and i'm
and i'm going to paint the gold i was there.
i owe him that.
when did you get to town?
i never left.
i'm staying with some friends.
i didn't want to leave my grandfather.
you come here every day?
when you leave, a nurse calls me.
i'm standing about half an hour.
where am i, johnny?
you're in the hospital, d
i can understand that.
why are you here?
or was there an earthquake crash?
does he speak?
yes, he does.
he learns like a child.
go, report this to dr. chad.
please, please.
why did he look at me so pretty
oh, he-he's in the hospital, dad.
she's a nurse.
this is molly, this is cecey, uh, this is annie.
this is my father.
yes, mr. tremont.
how can we make you comfortable?
you can start with those pipes on me.
i'd better eat something later.
are you going to starve me here?
okay, first, we need to take it slow.
remember, you haven't eaten in a long time.
maybe that's why i'm like this
have you thought about it?
all tests positive, vital signs stable.
this is a healthy human profile.
i've seen people coming out of a coma before.
we don't usually find out why.
i have some theories about this.
not now.
like what?
somehow we gave him the enzyme in the last serum blend, and we're lucky to have that.
i see.
you know, when we get home, we say it was all this.
but in return, it was your love and interest that brought your father back from where he went.
i think this is better.
me too.
they're here
what's going on, dad?
what are you looking for?
your mother and i are starting a new life together, johnny.
we need some new clothes.
i don't know, d
what do you think mom would say about all this
she'll probably laugh and call me crazy, but she'll laugh.
you've been home laughing.
how about that?
thank you.
thank you, thank you.
