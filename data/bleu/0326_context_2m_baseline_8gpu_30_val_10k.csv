michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, the one he shared his bed was his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for both of us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i will.
i need to write a essay about the moral side of the war and the ability of a conflict to prevent at least 000 words.
i'm not sure our ethics teacher would like me cheating while writing a essay.
so you passed my moral test.
as a matter of fact, he was desperately burned by the teacher of bethbaerlyad.
small crimes... can barely cut off the hand of any man.
no ring ring ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
the g.d.k.'s eye was on us.
your father thought it would make us look charity.
he must have faked my signature.
maybe a year ago i'll have a son... finish his cottage cheese!
you gotta get me out of this
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't look at him either
i don't have a mother's kindness and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yes-yes.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
meanwhile, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
why do i tell you this?
i guess there's some things you can't tell your father about
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set his teacher... to fulfill his motherhood.
there's nothing wrong with that.
but i have to explain to you that i'm a little hurt because you don't think about it.
auntie can do that.
and the teachers can do that.
surely someday you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay had never been so proud of what she said her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i was telling you about.
girl, really... young girl.
your date, nazh... your date, your
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma," you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache
yeah.
but gob misunderstood the emotional attraction that michael was courtesy... and felt he was fighting to get involved.
because, you know, beyond love... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
ich nazhgalia, michael, shannon really?
and there was a surprise visit to george sr.
i read all your teachings and i got all your tapes.
and i watched them all again.
george sr. had recently put a series of tapes on the market he'd recently explained to people about his solution to make money from his new spirituality.
i also lost two kilos eating your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to find out where
this is a good place to start.
and michael met lindsay at parent-teacher night after the two girls he was dating.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this room have the same floor plan as our kitchen?
i think she's perfect for you.
i thought you'd get it out of your head.
besides, i can't rush a job like this because my son wants to, and i can't marry someone.
i'm miss baerly, the vice teacher.
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life... that could be destroyed by an insensitive trigger.
and michael started getting to know his son's vice teacher.
that's the "rrrr" side.
you know, it's very annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr daniels' stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you laughed.
"rrrr!" - "rrrrr!"
but, you know, ... ... ... ... ...
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite you for a drink?
or... or...
yes, he's dead
well, i think that mr. daniels' stroke of the stroke...
let's go have a drink.
maybe it will help.
george sr was dealing with his own admirer.
i've already told you so many sins.
maybe you can tell me a few sins.
well, there are legal indicatives to my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me about one of those things that happened... at the university dorm again.
and what's his date with miss bayerly today's second date...
michael, this little korean came, and i don't know what to do with him.
at least, i think it's him.
to tell you for certain, you have to rob him to the underwear
yes, mother.
they'll take him back.
don't take off your shoes, little gentleman!
don't take off your shoes!
it's out of
who is it?
this "annong," your father and i have adopted.
what, i'm leaving for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille noticed the buster was worried, even jealous.
and he knew what it felt like to be ignored.
annyong is your brother's your brother
abort.
he's stay
listen, i'll call you back.
nice driving.
are you making dinner reservations?
it was a little korean.
and after the meetings...
michael took a step he hadn't taken in
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
very good idea.
but how are we gonna sneak in without waking everyone up
this might not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but apparently we're even now.
you took someone i love.
so i took someone you loved.
i'm "nashbagerajam"...."
listen, i know you're trying to get back at me for the marta thing.
i was lying to you when i said i wouldn't try to sleep him, so...
he needs to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i really had a chance to get rid of him.
no problem.
so romantic.
who's "n bahn-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but first i don't know if it's real.
but now... your moral teacher...
yeah, i did that for her.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm sure you're interested in her.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
about his lesson?
i mean, she loves him... that he loves
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with him.
and why did he do that?
why did he sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new... new...
he's not one of the good shooters that targeted him, and he's about to shoot everywhere
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, you think he's old for you, don't you think he's old
we don't even know how old he is.
nobody knows.
she was accompanying young girls at different dances... and i thought i'd go up to her side of the joke, do something...
"hey, you want to dance?"
and i thought, "oh, what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it different in front of the mirror, but
but, you know, um, we've been dancing with a joke or something.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should date someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i figured out a book that was hard to find a picture in the bathroom suite of saddamy.
what did sadadam do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's the same as our fire escape.
in prison, george sr was preparing for an evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon makes his preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael, while he's still angry with gob, he's looking for a family specialist to create trouble.
i know you went out with shannon.
with that cheerleader?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid,
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and i asked him... but he was breathing and he dropped the phone.
i haven't heard back.
you know, maybe we should both go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hello.
mom took him.
do's making me record it at school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss george michael's condition with mrs. bearly.
i'm sorry.
hey.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
i want to talk to you about it.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality... about mor
you see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's like in love with you, so...
he knows we're dating.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most contemptible thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been a moral teacher half a semester
look, it was a preemptive move.
my brother was trying to sleep with you.
then i want to leave you right now and i'm not coming back to you.
i see.
starting now.
george sr. went for a walk with cindi.
george.
and he got to know her.
you can totally pour your heart out here.
it weighs upon my soul
you, you...
he's picking up the camera
so this is your dinner, so it's away with mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy
watch your back, my little immigration brother!
and the different spring dance was in the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting him in because he doesn't have a strong square jaw with your perfectly-shaped nose and round eyes.
you wanna dance?
all right!
he finally found the shannon he was looking for...
he learned that gob cheated on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
sorry.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i ruined our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about this for a while, and-and...
you mean this is the right thing to do.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, my vice teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my vice teacher.
i'm really moved by you trying to protect me after i treated you so badly.
in fact, gob mistook michael's ethics teacher with domestic studies.
man, he... he knows.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a domestic teacher.
second position.
i was seeing miss baerly, and i shouldn't have dragged gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never wanted to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed about some sad things, but...
i don't think we have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm taking this cake.
hey, you wanna dance?
i can't believe this is working.
on the next arrested development.
buster's sweat gets heated.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
no candles allowed here.
mom goes crazy.
no, it's okay.
i burn my own candle.
yeah, that's what i'm gonna do
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
no problem.
right here, let me help you.
these too?
okay, here, let me carry it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is something really extreme.
too much.
come on!
come on!
ok!
ok!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die
we'll all go someday, won't we?
four months ago, each of you joined a interviews to join a show that had never been done.
and guess what?
you win.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm totally gay, and i'm proud of
you're sweet, aren't you
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel, from england.
me too.
that's my brother stanton; my probation officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him in the head.
he doesn't know
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they look like barack obama these days.
each one of you will make $00,000, all you have to do is spend a night in this prison.
abandoned prison.
wow!
fuck!
cool.
how come i never heard this show?
how do we know if this is a prank?
right.
this is our third show, but we're not gonna run it until the fall.
to see if this is a prank or not, you're gonna have to play and earn the money.
you will be asked to perform a series of tasks.
the missions will force your borders, your courage and your thinking.
sounds like fun, doesn't it?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i didn't even have a girlfriend to admit it when he was
i need to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
around.
you'll notice.
the money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if you all make it through the night, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can give me a night here.
anyone else want to join him?
not me.
there's no way i'm going to the city with this
i'm in
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him
bye.
you guys are idiots.
it's a bloody party joke, you're all gonna get high.
you're nothing but a bunch of idiots.
don't you see this recording party?
or become famous.
there's a human head in there!
don't worry, it's not
looks pretty real to me.
that's why they call it "special effects."
lovely, isn't it
a little sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thank you for our special effects team.
follow me, my friends.
in hot swamp water, lazy crocodiles await their prey.
the indian crocodiles are tall and slim-faced
this kind of crocodile...
guys.
i see you work hard as usual.
are we ready?
we're totally
and absolutely.
keep it that way.
yes, sir.
hey.
great job scaring them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are gonna be in the show
you really looked like you were compromised.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really gives me the creeps when
did you know that?
the homeless who died?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
probably a big coincidence.
do you really think it's safe there?
safe enough to get the show insured.
any more questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're recording.
each one of you was chosen by your own free will to spend the night in jail to win $00,000 a head.
clear enough, isn't it?
all right, let's get the party started.
you can find everything you need at your base camp, that's the principal's office.
where?
it's compl
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you took everything we had, how can we write it?
go down the hall, turn right, right again, then left.
straight to the stairs, left, right, and another left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
there you will find a key to escape your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought leaving the basement was terrible.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to the mission.
can you not do that?
i can't see a damn thing in here
does anyone remember where we're going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, two right, then left.
too much straight.
no, straight down the hallway down the hall, straight
"turn around, do it right again, and left.
"then straight to the stairs stairs,
"sola, right, and left again".
what are you?
smart.
illet, this is gonna be a great show
careful.
careful.
oh, god.
what is this place?
and get ready.
it was fun.
let's give them some speed.
yes, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't
the power's running, the generator should have kicked in already.
shit!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here
it's freezing in here
look, key.
yeah.
okay.
look, guys.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think it's the ward
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what's up, man?
"hi brave contestants.
"welcome to warden clem harvis' office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room
these chess rocks will determine your personal role.
"you cannot exchange your balls with other contestants.
"the rags were his favorite".
"now it's your turn to put your hand in the box."
shit.
well, who wants to go first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't
what do you mean you don't know
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black rook.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
fuck!
that was really crazy.
my little piggies, welcome to the mission.
now let me tell you about the pennyville state prison.
in 0000, when the crisis was increased, the brutal warden decided to destroy certain expenses and raise his fortune.
they were prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the warden was exposed.
the last person to be sentenced to death here was warden harvis himself.
rumor has it the warden's still roaming the halls.
you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured souls at this building tonight.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
anybody want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the prison chapel to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first hallway.
the sound is awesome.
thank you.
shit!
what happened?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, relax, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung babies!
their children... their
i think it's all covered with speakerphone.
voices are more effective than images to trigger our fears.
is that right?
okay.
oh, god!
sounds lovely.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't
something came up.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're making noise from the speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flashlight.
okay now?
open the bible's marked page...
"where you will find god's prayer.
"00 years ago, the sacred place was disrespected 00 years ago,,
"now this is the chamber of unusual events."
oh, that's the opposite.
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit
i can't do
"when you complete your mission...
"if a sign doesn't come from the principal,
you can go back to camp".
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry, whoever i'm bothering
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
" save us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"don't let evil rule us.
"protection us from overstepping...
"give us our debts, as we forgive those who owe us.
"and give us our daily bread today.
"as heavenly in heaven...
"like in the sky,
"because dominance and dominance are yours."
please tell me i can go now.
"before we hit camp"...
jesus, randall, you should blow out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look what they do for money.
where'd he go?
from what i understand, the people who did this job have cut off our contact with our homo friend for a little while to give it a more creepy weather.
whatever.
definitely, it's gone pretty smooth
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, man, it's not that bad.
definitely not worth the money.
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it
they can give you another assignment.
don't joke
i swear you don't even know how you feel in there.
it's like walking through thick fog, just cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next.
what do you mean?
some cameras aren't working?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complex.
let's get sczi to go down and have a look, you'll have it.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go downstairs and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy
either we talk or i go.
it's important to me too, taylor
what do you mean?
i did a little research.
are you talking about the town girls you've been sleeping with?
am i right?
big lips, broad hips, taylor.
okay, so the prison wasn't just for
is there a women's department?
and that fucking crazy warden walked around the women's section naked, never answered anyone.
he would beat them, rape them, get pregnant, and starve them to death.
some people say they feed their own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this real story will improve the show!
anyone could be talking about us.
that's nothing compared to the fact that you invented the story.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do that, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
yeah?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they do.
good.
sczi, what is that?
just a little something to help me take off the night.
want some?
get your hairy ass over here, okay?
aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the hell out of me.
i got a great stuff.
suit yourself.
we're all ready to begin.
i can tell you my biggest fear is to be buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will take you to freedom of freedom."
okay,
at the end of liberty.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
fuck!
what?
blood.
it's not real
no cursing, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs aren't down, you're up.
i'm sorry
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you go down, you'll see a door with a finger
he says... he says
shit!
"welcome to cell number five.
" considering the violent and insanity and insanity,
shit.
tell me what to do... so i can get out of this hell.
no!
thank you.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a convict can commit suicide if he can't,
"now you shall live punishment for a prisoner."
okay, where's the
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult task.
"what will you do when you enter the half".
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my duty.
connie.
what?
check this out.
what?
can't...
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back, and i specifically told you... you added a show, and you're asking me why you were fired?
this isn't our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't
don't look at me.
look, connie, you have to get that guy out, okay?
he's gonna screw
shit!
we'll be ruined.
you didn't bring this there?
cut it out, no.
very clear.
what's clear?
approach.
i asked you why you were putting cameras in the control room.
yeah.
behind the surveillance footage... they want to record... the
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
it's brilliant, is
absolutely brilliant.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to record how scared you put something on the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black king and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you could be reassigned.
smartass.
okay, black king and white horse turning right and heading to the gas chamber.
the white queen and black horse are running straight, and they're going to the prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"king and horse go left and then right.
"rook and the horse go all the way down the hallway,
"and go down the stairs".
sczi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
sczi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, open it.
we're in.
"welcome to the pack room.
there must be a light on the wall behind you, open it.
"black king and white knight entering the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
it deserves the best, it's the whole place.
it's the only place the legal department cle
isn't it beautiful?
pretty scary.
oh, god.
what's that smell?
documented facts of death often carry their own smell of death.
of course the smell isn't your death
if a man knows his life is coming to the end of his life, his concern is caused by the release of matter which gives him plenty of smells.
in that case, what we're worried about is the smell of human smell and the gas that killed him.
it's fun time, ladies and gent
the black hawk is sitting in the chair.
black king?
this is me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you will find some meat and a panic.
you'll cook this meat and eat it.
man!
prisoners always eat meat's flesh cows, pig...
"or because there's no lamb or some other meat...
"that he was suspected.
they thought it was a nice meat they'd never tasted before.
you mean human flesh, don't you?
are you in there?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i gave up.
you'll get toni on the phone.
i'm giving it to you, toni should totally live the fear of the prisoners just before the gas is given.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends have some weird demands.
are you okay?
okay.
"your mission's gas teammate...
to find the main van without killing and cut the gas."
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to puke.
okay.
weird.
i can't do
i can't
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
"no more pranks."
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they'll pay extra money".
do it for the team, girl.
are you gonna throw up?
thank you.
okay, angel, i'm at the bottom of the stairs.
shit!
can you hear me?
he's back
it really stinks.
let me out.
come on.
let me out, man.
oh, god!
who's the guy standing there?
topless.
muscular.
let me out.
i don't know, con. this guy is starting to creep
stop playing games.
let me out.
how's it going
we need to talk to you.
outside?

they closed everything.
it's over
the bbc can confirm that the american terrorist leader adem qasim has escaped from mi0 custody in one of the most serious failures in the event history of
the security convoy transporting qasim seems to have been attacked at raf northolt.
you say it's not war but murder because it's on the west
because in new york, in washington, you didn't want that in london.
but the children of pakistan didn't either.
when they get hit by drone airplanes, they call it murder.
qasim offers a new kind of threat.
so far, he hasn't targeted civil
our models show a 00% chance of an attack within 00 hours.
the more pressure he gets, the smaller the window becomes.
i can't say that under the tape recording...
the secretary of state is coming tomorrow
we serve the british people, not washington.
if that isn't true anymore, we're already
americans think we don't serve purpose anymore.
we need a head.
i'll be relieved of duty
did you hear about qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, what's gonna happen to me
you're out too.
no one else knows you're in qasim's network
just go.
will holloway?
go.
how's life after mi0?
you're not from the moscow section.
london needs you.
is there anyone you should say goodbye to?
thank you.
we know harry's contact with your family, so we understand that this may not be easy for you.
even if he's dead, it'
harry's too arrogant to kill himself.
he was pretending to kill himself.
he went to this woman's grave
the love of your life
harry's team has noticed changes in harry's attitude since she died.
he's become emotionally distant, cold, he's started drinking
water would be below 0 degrees.
he'd have hypothermic me before he got to the bank
this is the picture before you entered the square, and this is the one you said you were taken after you jum
before she disappeared, harry made three encrypted phone calls.
your old emergency message box.
why did he call you?
i have no idea.
the last time i spoke to him was the night he pulled me out of mi0 0 years
he wants to talk right now.
that makes you useful.
can you help us find him?
no, thanks.
and you, harry, do you talk much about berlin?
the night your father died?
if there's anything else, mace, i have a right to know.
i don't think i can decide that...
if you weren't really gonna kill her, i think you told me what you wanted
find harry, so you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
i thought i was taking this title to the grave.
the anti-terrorist president lately for his majesty's security services.
funny, but who are you really?
someone who knows what these two words mean to you.
asma shishani.
go.
how did you find me?
what do you want?
i know it was someone on my side.
they never told me who they were.
of course they didn't, but you must have a connection.
it's a phone number, that's
the phone number will work.
in return, i'll give you what you want.
impossible.
he said he was a human rights lawyer.
your government helped them after putting two brothers in prison.
but after i was released, she became too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if he's an agent, he's not one
then don't worry, tell me again it doesn't mean anything to you.
keep her alive, she's guaranteed i'll keep my word.
i don't need guarantees.
take him to a hospital now or the deal is off!
what she needs is mercy.
no!
she's got a
and you sent him after me?
you put him in danger and now you refuse to save him from pain?
how the fuck are you?
don't send a video to his family.
harry... harry
you have a deal.
according to the bbc, the fugitive terrorist is no improvement on adam qasim's capture.
the national threat level has been compromised, so eli has an attack on his ear.
in economy news, the ftse 000 fell again this morning and sterling continued to breathe the dollar, the euros and other funds.
there's a new intel on harry.
he got a prepaid line we tracked down to kent coast.
holloway, this is classified.
we found traces of explosive there.
you've known him longer than any of us.
do you think it's possible that qasim might have got harry involved somehow?
pulling him over?
i don't
anyway, you find harry, we find qasim.
anything for holloway?
here you go.
tomorrow, 00.
salpa 0, show a, park at bay 0.
then, open your eyes.
i hope you come alone.
just for protection.
we're seriously in trouble if you can't get a crazy cold war morgue to hit.
i promise.
it doesn't say yet.
we play this through harry's way until we see him.
copy that.
doors opening.
go.
ground floor.
doors opening.
open sightings, multiple exits.
repeat, holloway.
things harry needs to set up a meeting.
yes, mr. holloway, your uncle said he'd meet you at the coffee shop.
she left her cell phone at home.
the guy in the parking lot, get rid of him
she'd have to wear a mi0 shirt.
listen to me.
stop underestimating harry.
don't think he won't put your men in danger.
wait for him to send a signal...
what is it, alpha 0?
holloway?
holloway, where are you going?
wait.
no, we don't have a system there
don't move.
holloway, freeze!
terminal 0b.
doors closing.
he got me a flight.
pa000, the glasgow plane.
i'm going to dallasow.
search the glenow office.
get me the airport police.
priority code number nine.
the police want a clear path to the terminal.
and get us permission to secure heathrow.
the passengers from the flight of pa000, willigow flight...
holloway, don't get into the air section
what am i doing here, harry?
i had to find someone outside the service i can trust.
it's a short list when you're drunk, crazy and dead.
to be honest, the only person i can call friend is someone who thinks i ruined his life.
qasim's escape was arranged by someone on the top of the service.
by one of the people who asked you to follow me.
that's why i needed to disappear.
qasim had it.
he's our only connection to the traitor
once he's in the system, he'll be
he's planning an attack.
someone's trying to destroy the service itself.
you're crazy.
ruth's death... ruth's
don't
look for yourself, that's all i want.
what are you waiting for, harry?
mi0 was my everything, and you took it from me, and for nothing.
hate me all you want, but i think you believe in the service.
what happened in berlin?
they tricked you like that?
this may not end as you hoped.
i'm afraid i have to tell them there's something in the lining of your jack
nothing there, but they'll have to check it out.
i'll send you a number.
call me in 00 hours, please.
i'm security services.
put your hands behind your back!
you just let him go.
relax, francis.
we don't want you to have a heart
the deadly one.
mi0 seems completely responsible right now, and i'm the last friend in the government of mi0.
so you're really gonna have to be nice to
in other words, is he crazy?
this isn't contradicting her last three psychological
she refused to attend.
harry pearce hasn't stopped being.
no matter how crazy he is, i still catch him...
for instance.
she asked me to help her disappear.
you didn't think to accept your request and bring it to us?
just because your life hasn't been worth a damn since harry dropped you off doesn't mean we can't put your life in a more shitty position right
since we threatened each other, you three shouldn't be caught in the blood that you weren't hanging on a cliff.
your entire organization seems to be disposable right now.
find qasim.
fully loaded.
they're ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i saw this name working on a case.
i thought they relieved you of duty.
they did.
now, what really happened?
the abduction may have been arranged by someone in the service.
do you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i left it two weeks ago.
there must be one around here.
tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't.
when i was 00, i was hanging out with a kid who had money transfers.
k was interested in some people using it, so they came to me.
you started as an agent?
and when i was done, they asked me to train as an officer.
my parents came back to me when i told them.
and if someone you work with helped qasim escape, that would be a problem, right?
all right.
something felt wrong that day.
rob vass, my team leader, was in the front vehicle with me.
he told me not to open the weapons compartment.
he ordered me to chase him.
where does he live?
it's
w00.
panama city.
service bribe fund.
june, what are you... what are you
who are you?
you told me not to chase qasim.
you told me not to chase after my gun.
we swore an oath, rob.
i'm not saying anything until we get to thames house.
we're not going to thames house.
will, what did you find?
qasim's guards are deliberately weakened.
the team leader was involved.
he's just a sho
find out who gave the order.
the americans think mi0 is the weak link, and i think one of them is joining them.
qasim escaped, we fell out of sight.
the cia got the whole thing.
fire... fire
he was gonna shoot
his pulse... pul
dead, dead.
he's
listen.
you should go home.
june!
i'll take care of this, but you gotta go, now.
i never heard a part of you get killed with that song.
who's warrener hit the eyelash?
landon miller.
agency witness.
he's trying to secure his continued support, hoping not to give the keys to the kingdom.
every time i see you, francis, you look like you've been buried another inch or two inches away from langley or pentagon.
you don't have to tell me
i think in times like these, we should remember whose flag is shaking.
francis.
i'm trying to help, but he's basically accusing me of doing business for the cia
tonight, your generals, your politicians, your spies have come together for a celebration.
tonight, we will strike at the heart of their power.
our enemy, the politicians who send your sons and daughters to die in illegal wars.
spies spying on you like you're criminals.
this war is far beyond religious differences.
all the flights out of the united kingdoms...
he had it.
warrender lived.
if you have a way to get to qasim, say it now.
there's another way.
qasim's wife.
asma shishani.
the fsb has her.
if i find her where they keep her, she'll give the traitor.
you made a deal with him.
yeah.
and if we can, he'll lead us straight to him.
surrender and set it up.
how do you know the russians have her?
in exchange for a cia agent stuck in moscow.
i can reach a distance, but you need to open the secret door.
this is an ip address.
you're kidding.
it's the only way, will
harry's getting help from somewhere.
i got your old contacts, but i need access to personnel files to do it properly.
but it doesn't take you anywhere exciting.
i'm in position.
looks like i'm gonna have to steal more extra bandwidth.
your drink.
malcolm?
all right, i'm in.
i'm looking at the servers now
harry, we gotta go.
can't we do this any faster?
i can do it.
but unfortunately, this machine is from the previous century.
g branch already pulled these.
erin watts.
might be worth a closer look.
fill in the blanks for me.
but i got an agent.
i almost got him out.
i've been in business for less than a year.
or soon they make you choose.
all right, i'll leave you alone.
are we done?
why am i sure?
i'm sorry, will.
harry.
harry!
harry, what have you done?
stay away from the computer.
i didn't feel the need to say this before, but i hope you know what you're doing.
is harry working with qasim?
he stole an entire gchq data archive.
everything we have on our western agents in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
he showed up on the airport cctv at schrefeld.
i don't
harry cyber didn't strike the attack alone.
then who's helping him?
except you.
and you still protect her.
why?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i'll find him.
and there's a threat.
according to the analysis, there will be a large-scale attack within 00 hours, multiple targets.
a operative on qasim's escape is missing.
there are signs of struggle in his house.
do you know anything about that?
how's your mother, holloway?
i hear he's not very good.
he hasn't packed since your father died.
understandable, really.
and then that door comes to work.
i know, i know.
harry was right about one thing.
you're not good enough.
home secretary, can we really hope to stop qasim attacking again?
we've destroyed the threats of our freedom and the way we live.
your ability to wound us may be important, but it's the end of
you'll find out there are no limits to our
they won't listen.
they never killed our women?
we're making the world a better place, brother.
transfer team in position at the airport.
we have authorization by the atc to shut down the prisoner car when necessary.
i think i owe you.
you were absolutely right about vass.
danke.
alexanderplatz.
it's on the northeast corner of the metron, 00rd
we have a safe house.
call it nostalji.
don't forget to bring the archives
don't forget to bring his wife
how did you find me?
there's only one place to meet in berlin.
you told me.
northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
no emotionality.
this is the price of qasim's wife.
when the fsb is out of custody, qasim will give me a number.
he's taking me to the traitor.
they'll destroy the service, where it can be defended.
get in the car, harry.
there's an old hotel about 00 minutes away.
my contact can meet us there with a clean passport.
you're going home.
sorry about that.
why are you here, miss keaton?
keep moving, harry.
i killed someone because of you.
you're c0.
what are you doing, harry?
talent discovery.
and which one of you found it?
jesus christ, will.
preparation is everything.
and vass?
when he came to my house, i reported
i said someone was asking about qasim's escape.
they tied me to the command center and told me what to do.
they went to vass's house before we did, and they planted the evidence.
i set vass to escape.
you think i want to do it?
i know my mission.
i'm the only one who kn
you were set up.
he's right, will.
but i wonder if miss keaton's sure about me.
it was a secure command chain.
what was i supposed to do?
do you believe him?
yeah.
i'm sure your men will come and find you if your usefulness is still valid.
after all this was over, what did you think they were gonna do to you
i did what they asked me to do.
we're changing the deal.
we're taking qasim's wife to london.
tell him to come to the exchange, or he'll never see his wife again.
let's go get her.
what happened to alexanderplatz?
a sudden agoraphobia feeling.
i'm afraid there was a problem with qasim's wife
at least be good enough to put it in my car.
harry.
colonel.
i hate to be unkind, but we're gonna need your clothes.
as the search for adam qasim intensifies, all passengers travelling on the united kingdom's national line will have to show valid id and face bag control.
i have your wife.
let me talk to him.
the russians put him to sleep and...
bullshit.
i'm bringing your wife to london.
no.
i'll tell your whore you said good-bye.
is the baby too much?
no, it's the same you
i trusted june.
you were right to take me off duty.
despite everything i've done, you're still here trying to do something good.
i will not allow your sacrifices to be in vain.
it was here.
was it fast?
he could've let me go, but he chose not to
if you try anything, anything at all, i can't guarantee anyone's safety.
nobody's
you bring my wife, i'll give you your phone number.
here we go.
hello?
holloway.
this message came from h branch.
me.
we can catch qasim, but we need help.
and let's go.
one clean choice, hannah.
trust me, and help me.
or go.
either do well or do well, right?
shit.
they're approaching position.
what i wrote last night is updating itself without stopping the algorithm regenerating, reviewing all potential points of view.
so he's not cutting water?
please.
all right, we're here.
how much time do we have?
i'm looking at 000 cameras.
give me something.
once he realizes we're playing him, he'
wait.
he worked 00 seconds ago.
are you sure?
yes, confirmed.
camera disabled in the last minute.
third roof, east corner.
harry, we have to stall.
i have to hope he's looking right at us.
yeah?
you were told south.
i have his wife.
you were supposed to look south.
give me the number.
give me the number or we'll leave.
turn around now or you die.
here.
him too.
i haven't got it yet.
you have 0 seconds to turn around.
turn.
maybe this guy never saw her.
almost there.
him?
kill him.
give me the number.
don't
stop!
no!
okay?
will, she's fine.
the shooter is dead.
then it's over.
malcolm, feather.
yeah?
my wife is dead, isn't
harry, listen.
let hannah report us.
harry?
hannah, why did harry remove the earphones
i don't
report us.
get sco00 here, now.
rdx loaded four truck, leaving limehouse north industrial park in the next 00 minutes.
how do you know?
qasim just told me.
trucks loaded with bombs in 00 minutes.
i think we got him.
let's go!
armed police!
stay where you are!
clear!
clear!
the main target?
negative!
negative!
negative, sir.
command, area clear.
harry.
he sold his own men.
why would he do that?
what did you do?
armed police!
freeze!
move!
you have to tell them everything, harry.
i think we have a lot to talk about.
this might be a little out of line.
since the southwest corner of alexanderplatz.
keep holloway eye on you.
make sure he's safe.
maybe we won't be so hasty.
did you find qasim?
harry will talk.
you still don't know him.
qasim gave up his entire operation.
what did you say to him?
i should have thought they'd release you after berlin.
they want to offer you a deal.
throw everything on harry and go.
i told them i'd leave it after i did.
there's no way
i can't
you have an emergency backup key wrapped around your neck.
whatever you're up to... wh
what would ruth think?
what did you give him?
check the back.
southwest corner.
i found harry in the northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
the opposite.
where you're gonna trap somebody.
harry?
i gave you to him.
get down!
get down!
get down!
lock us down.
get down!
get down!
we're not here for you!
we came for them.
get down!
think of your families.
hamza.
why?
there are 00 men on the other side of these doors.
you must surrender.
come here.
open up!
if you think we're gonna negotiate...
open the door.
but he'll kill us.
there are too many demons in a room.
the only way out of here alive is to surrender...
you think i want to get out?
how many people's lives start to end in this room
the lives of my people.
your people?
no one asked you to speak for them, to kill for them.
if you want a hostage...
i think he made it clear he wasn't interested in
i'm the director general of mi0.
kill me and put the gun down.
otherwise, you're nothing but a dead terrorist.
no one will see you as a hero.
when we're done, you're gonna be a drunken, impotent heathead who beats his wife.
we'll drive up a few marrakech boys' whores and give them free tickets to disneyland in return for saying you begged them to piss on you.
we can't remember you very well, can we, adam?
wait, wait, wait.
i pulled the helicopter back.
but... but
you fucking coward.
i thought you were fighting a higher standard.
i'm sorry about your wife's death, adam
i know what this can do to you.
is that supposed to stop me?
it's
stop!
why did you bring him here?
i made a choice.
without a plan b.
why do you think i keep you out of your room?
people are still dead, harry.
less than the ones who will die in the explosions.
what choice do you make?
this is my job.
auntie, can you come outside and play?
hello, geraldine.
finally, it comes down to who tells the longest lie.
right?
if we had protected that morning, qasim would never have escaped.
you gave met's air unit an order to reverse all mi0 requests, didn't you?
that's the advantage of being a lone maniac.
i don't need to prove it
sacrificing his own fortune so he can be absorbed by a foreign power.
americans would have made you director general, no doubt.
how many more lives was that promotion worth?
what did you think you made, harry?
the service is dying
but if i'd given up the moment i realized i was on the losing side, my career would be too
blowing my brains out, finding my 00-year-old niece...
i think it came from you.
what is this?
the thin gut goes crazier than 0 hours or leads to unstoppable bleeding.
leaves no trace.
how clever.
i was afraid that would be your answer.
so i took your chance to choose.
it's not lunch that makes you sick.
i ate a cattle rib.
tell me you lied, harry.
please.
tell me you didn't betray your country.
it's been 0 hours, geraldine.
you can spend the last three hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you i'd go out and play with your beautiful niece
i'm thinking.
your message said you'd tell me something.
they're spying on ruth's grave.
you can't leave now.
i have something that should be yours, actually.
your father was wearing this the night he died.
the stasi removed everything that could work and found a way to get into your body and the fsb archives.
he was wearing a wedding ring on the night of his operation?
i didn't kick you out of your assignment because you weren
after your dad, i couldn't...
i should have protected you.
the good don't last forever, will.
then who does?
they're like me
it would help if you knew your problem and told the men at the door.
hotel middle school has room for every guest.
single file.
these new problems are killing in the dark.
these people will be grateful when the darkness falls.
i think we should keep them here to keep them safe, but i'm worried things are getting worse.
they have no idea who caused the darkness.
besides, what we have to worry about isn't hiding in the
we still haven't figured out how to get that fog wall up
maybe it's a blessing.
this was the latest from in-flight safety.
i'm on your side and i might need a new job.
it's under my control, but if i can get another pillow for my beauty sleep, it'll be fine.
try to fix things.
we talked about this.
it's almost impossible to eliminate a person's problem without killing him.
of course, i just need information that's impossible to provide tools that i don't have, and maybe not.
i'm gonna need a team
do you have any idea what's going on?
but there's a bad element.
it's the only way to protect the rest of us
it's risky driving because of the magnet problem.
an engineer to help fix the power plant.
he volunteered as soon as he knew.
if things don't work out, you can use his problem for the operator.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
the untraceable killer is out there somewhere.
and i think he really wants to prove to you that he wants to help.
okay, well, whatever the reason, look after her for me, okay?
because neither of us is immune to new problems.
i'm not saying it's just my
i'll call the person who caused the darkness trouble when you're gone.
he stole those batteries and endangered us.
there was no choice, dwight.
this is the third case in two weeks.
now the serial killer is in this building.
okay, i'm gonna go talk to dwight.
my father always said you were a good man.
mara's father?
there may be a way, but if you want me to explain it, it may seem more frightening, so
even on the map, i can't find maine, haven.
are you telling me you can't find a town with 00,000 population?
that didn't cause problems.
then why didn't we use aether in the first place to end the troubles?
i can't bring them when they're sealed.
so how do we find it?
gloria brought a box of stuff that duke left on gull.
i don't think william has the amount i need, and aher is just the first phase.
you told his wife you'd find him.
it's easy to make a decision on the side, but sometimes things
i have a town to protect.
no wonder the plant is working at 00%.
guys, i'll try, but remember, i've never done anything like this before.
they parked the car so i could talk to you, but i don't have enough money to pay for the oil change.
if everything goes well, i'll be back with aether before sunset.
this is peggy's husband, rolf.
enough panic and fear.
the same killer who killed my son 00 years ago?
we call him the murderer who won't leave a trace.
what else are you hiding from me, vince?
dwight's doing everything he can to make the rules accept, but he's not the guy to kill people.
in this haven, banishment is the same as execution.
thanks to our friend there, we keep them in some kind of prison.
he says the generator works at 00%.
shit, when the generator overloaded, the energy reserves must have emptied.
well, that explains the power to the town.
at this rate, about five minutes.
it's almost over, and it's the only thing that protects us from dying
here, i reconfigured the generator settings to get power to the town faster, but there's nothing else we can do.
they better get back.
help each other.
turn the lamps around.
share your supplies.
you see, i'm happy here.
i got your message.
get in the car now.
come on, jump!
if war lies ahead, we should be thankful, even slean.
i don't think you have anything worse than falling in love.
i don't like it here.
there are two sides to every story.
whoever's behind this is a traitor.
let's go.
he asked me to represent him at slean's wedding.
palace, you are my brother's love.
that's why you're my brother.
you've seen bigger places in the iraq realms than here.
none of them were ruled by a woman.
you should choose a second to accompany you and watch your interests during the ritual.
then you will hear the bonds of your friends and relatives.
i have no relatives here.
my mother and the others will join you.
kela, this is the palace from bregan.
rheda, must you always be guarding me?
i don't really get it.
but i know i should marry slean.
i'll love her.
this marriage cannot happen.
abrecan trusts you.
what do you do?
carpenter.
they can use you on the wall then.
who are you?
a friend of the chairman.
like i said, i have work to attend to.
we need to think how to handle it.
varr said i couldn't accept gifts.
between you and me, then.
every bride ought to smell good when the wedding
remember, it's our secret.
sit down.
we'll take what we'll get when they look at the wounded.
you wanted to talk?
all right.
kela, it's time for your ritual.
elvina, will you be the second person i have?
for the game.
we need to talk sometime.
we need to discuss why the marriage shouldn't work.
if we don't fulfil our mission, their marriage may be
beowulf!
let's celebrate.
by old traditions!
the dress smells skewers.
i'm so sorry.
it was just a little mistake.
that's it
we're gonna help slean give the symbol to his bride.
sounds easy.
breca!
open the door!
come on, you stinking mudborn.
come on!
come on!
give me your arm.
come on!
slean.
be quiet, the bald sleeps.
are they ready for this marriage?
i don't understand why slean didn't want to marry kela.
i don't think so.
he should put his feelings aside and do what's best for everyone.
would you put aside what you wanted for others?
that's what we all have to do.
if someone spends their whole life pleasing others, then that person doesn't actually live.
it must make you feel pretty free to think that way.
try it.
tell every rock the truth.
but then you can look at each other and light the fire that symbolizes your marriage.
then you'll be husband and wife.
have you loved someone before?
no.
before you came here... you...
do you want to be thane?
tell my uncle i'm done with him.
go.
come on!
go on!
you let him go.
we're not done here.
don't you understand?
i betrayed my mother and set up a plot with my uncle.
this woman was sent here to kill you!
i don't
was it?
i killed my brother.
he was the one who was supposed to be with
even if the world were destroyed, mara had everything.
people loved him because he was kind.
my father loved him because he was his first child.
rowan and lovers.
and then i had the opportunity to escape.
i didn't need anything.
she died of humor.
he was recovering.
i poisoned him.
slean, i won't tell anyone what you're doing here today and what's
or stay.
i know, but he's beowulf's.
he went to bed the other night.
but we can choose who we can draw our destiny with.
light with me.
you want to be thane?
i can help you.
against those who oppose you.
they can't take it from you anymore, rheda.
with this marriage you're jarl of shieldlands.
these rules of jarl must be used by any tribe.
if the blood isn't paid, a killer's life will be
the thieves will be branded and cast out of society.
all the cost of trade in shieldlands will be determined by jarl.
what right does he have to identify the price of fish?
we're the ones risking their lives to catch the pandiri every summer.
you should have told me about these rules.
you were where your people needed you the most, on guard.
i couldn't distract you
it was messy enough.
you're late for pandiri.
some think you missed him again.
but if you fail, bregan will be miserable and open the winter.
breca's wanted for murder, you know it.
kill him!
kill breca now!
i got it!
do it without any explanation, and we're all dead.
after he escaped the gallows, he hired us to bring breca to the law.
we wanted to ask the guy who helped him escape the first time?
that's why we'll welcome this.
but we have to keep the breca.
as we speak, herot can stand our gates!
when do we kill young women sometimes?
what do you mean?
you've been hiding in the shadows for too long, ab
don't forget who you're talking
talk.
he wants breca's life or blood money for his brother's murder.
i didn't mean to kill anyone.
hurry!
thank you.
breca loved my mom.
he's looking for the kinds he thinks he's got, and then he's stealing the money and running, this
she left my mother and took everything of value with her.
my brother came after him.
but it cost him his life.
breca, is it true?
i'll pay for your brother's blood.
lila, do you have 00 silver coins?
i don't want money, i want blood
silence!
if the blood is paid, breca will be released.
you lied to me.
pandiri.
pandiri!
fasten it.
get ready, they're coming.
i saw it.
get out!
the council is assembled
he's willing to take my place because i lost the antidote.
you let me down, slean married keela, rheda became jarl!
you don't understand
tell the council our enemies are gathering, that your sister cannot rule, that you want to save shieldlands.
so tell me you're distracted.
tell me.
i'm sorry
i knew breca killed someone, but the story he told me was different.
it's only his fault.
lila, nobody thinks bad things about you...
that's all i got.
did you bring it?
there aren't 00 silver
not enough.
i'll hold breca while i see that job.
was there enough money?
lila?
turn it off, beowulf, please.
you won't talk to lila.
get on your horse, leave heroot and never come back.
there's no room for you here any
if herot's being attacked, i want to fight properly.
if herot's attacked, i'll protect you.
let's try.
it's not about mudborn.
i don't want to talk about him
i want to know why you lied about training me.
it's wasted on you.
you don't even want to be one.
yeah?
i didn't know we trained the blacksmiths!
go.
now!
he fights girls now?
the landscape was more like he was training the blacksmith.
i know you think i let you down.
that i can't focus on my duties in bregan.
but i have my reasons.
you're talking about treason against your own blood.
this land needs a warrior!
someone to bring their people out of the darkness.
a man in power who will take control!
you're talking about betraying your sister to hide the fact that you can't afford your people.
what's the point of having fish if we're all going to be slaughtered
i'm here to vote insecurity for our thane.
those against abrecan being thane.
the verdict
a new thane will be appointed and announced in the morning.
get up.
next.
nobody.
don't think this is a game
we're lazy, distracted.
this will work here.
from now on, we'll work like my father hrothgar.
i didn't mean to interrupt
you're a good teacher.
a great thane needs a strong army behind him.
we don't have to share the same bed, but if we don't share the same room, people will
i always liked watching herot from here.
it looks so invincible.
if i tell my mother the truth, i'll lose her trust.
and a chance to rule one day.
what if abrecan attacks?
herot could fall.
no advice?
i trust you.
your decision will be right.
i'll be there when you do.
you'll be thane.
you just have to believe it.
pandiri.
pandiri!
it's the pandir
sound the horn!
i order you, play the horn!
abrecan, give it up.
if we don't act now, we'll get the opportunity
why... why
you, help me with the net.
help me with the net now.
why don't you help me?
pandiri!
come on, hurry up!
go find me a sack.
people shouldn't leave their valuables anywhere.
you owe my mom an apology.
but i'm a warrior and honor is at stake.
so i'll take your life.
go back to mommy, little girl.
greetings.
i didn't need your help.
because he didn't have enough money to save you.
be thankful you didn't kill him, vishka
if we don't plant the nets, our prey will be
no, he won't.
get ready.
abrecan, no!
hold the rope still!
hurry, they'll eat you alive!
pandiri, pandiri!
pandiri, pandiri!
hold on!
now get back!
check it out.
there will be songs about this hunt.
a prey you won.
i have a dream about us.
being the biggest tribe in the shieldlands!
we're not going to follow the laws a jarl can't even keep a sword.
who's with me?
abrecan, abrecan, abrecan!
i have to warn beowf.
bregan!
elvina!
the warriors are coming together.
they intend to destroy us this time.
beowulf!
if we look around today, we'll see more danger and harm come from religious beliefs.
my wife would be less embarrassed if i talked about the soviet communism or the atrocities of stalin.
it's the status of the philosophy of questioning things that make trouble for people, especially the situation.
presenting a situation that is perfectly true in itself can cause serious damage.
when the prophecy doesn't happen, we make fun of those people and the whole world makes fun of us.
i had a friendly disposition with richard dawkins.
maybe we should be more aggressive with richard.
especially america is surrounded by christian faith.
they're sure the world is what their religion says it is.
we'll get rid of the bad gu
i'd like to write a book like that, if i could.
but of course one of my fears is what happens next.
what kind of chaos?
how true would it be to do that to people who think religion can protect us from civilization and good in ours?
religion is like moral viagra for many people.
if that's true, if the religion does guide people to moral lives, then anybody's gonna take a serious leap of our own and turn the bottom line.
because there may be lots of people left down there and we can create a chaos out of these people's fear.
a lot of people want their lives to mean something, and where does that come from?
but there must be something better than religion.
yeah, there's definitely hope.
let's see what happens.
of course.
at least you didn't get a piercings.
i don't know how to explain this to amy.
i'm the dumbest man in
all right, stop it.
i'm the dumbest man in
okay, you win this.
i can't find emma's papers.
honey, just so you know, you can't return the baby if you find the original receipt.
i need to find the paper angela signed when she left emma on my doorstep and gave me the only regent he gave me.
i'm finally getting health insurance for what i am responsible for myself and care.
i haven't talked to her since the night we made emma.
calm down.
you gave me all the important paperwork on the baby to keep them safe.
do you have all the papers?
his father's little girl is his father'
maybe something with a balloon.
it looks good!
you robbed a clown?
it's your birthday!
my first birthday is tomorrow.
you used to party all the time when you
celebrating my birthday... after that...
"happy birthday miley." "
you know those papers i kept for me?
how irresponsible do you think i am?
but i... but
i may have mailed them in on time, but she didn't mail them, and i might be the only one with emma's attorney.
we were all excited because the new baby came and i didn't have a stamp!
look, if we get angela to sign this document again, we'll be fine.
since you're the best friend of ben's and you're the only one who's seen
i like it very much, all right.
all right, emma's finally asleep
hey, danny, what's the reason riley doesn't want to celebrate her birthday?
why does he really hate it so much?
ben riley didn't celebrate her birthday after her 00 years of disaster.
are you sure you want to watch this?
i think i'd remember if it was a disaster.
all right, come on, everybody.
danny, where are we going?
fortunately for the future that you won a real mustache and lost one kilo of personality.
me here too?
benjamin wheeler, come here and celebrate riley's birthday.
well, i can tell you this is my best birthday ever.
tell me you didn't do anything to the cake.
actually, try to save it with a perm first and then cut it out.
is riley still in love with ben or is that something that happened when he was a kid?
unless you still love riley.
i ruined the girl's sweet 00.
it's not on birthdays, but the rest of the time he loves
if ben is so irresponsible that he lost the papers and too scared to face me, maybe he doesn't deserve to take emma's attorney alone.
if it makes you feel better, we do most of the work.
i can imagine how hard it is to leave emma.
i knew how beautiful, funny or amazing you'd end up hurting her!
in your presence on the streets of the city, the elite u.s. military unit of the u.s. military unit, slave trooper,
also known as the madox-00, the limited combat capability in the area is quite high.
what's more, he's got more damage powers than a uh-00 blackhawk.
it's perfect for anti-terrorist and anti-gerilla operations.
miss kusumoto is also the chief architect of the software for "tankbuster."
in order to reveal madox's abilities with his disposal, the pilot himself passed into the cabin today.
unit 0 will go to ichigaya tonight.
we're in a hurry, so try to be as fast as you can.
and...
mrs. kusumoto, you've made me quite embarrass
i'm not here for congratulations
i have one thing to say to you:
wow!
kouji... k
what is it?
onose, leave this to me!
they just threw away their trash.
i'm telling you, don't worry
i'll buy you dinner in return, won't i?
sdf's transport vehicle...
according to the reports, it was natural to encounter this case...
obviously terrorist work.
you're a lot of strangers in the eastern bloc operation.
i hope you know what you're saying!
i hope you see the burden of the accident is entirely yours.
either way, the situation we're in is critical.
we were transferring him to the field test!
it's fuck
i have to make the operation.
besides, the madox-00 is being overdone right now.
we're having trouble searching the crime scene.
do you think we should get some backup from the police on the phone
we must prepare ourselves for the worst, and keep the help corps ready.
i'm the only one who can go up against the madox and get high.
although lieutenant kilgore is one of the most troubles in the army, he is our best tanker in the army.
is this-- is this okay?
nobody's in the building?
anyway, i'm a little relieved.
shiori was a really pretty girl...
when he goes to study in england, all the boys in japan will mourn.
how did you know that?
he called me in the morning and asked me to give you a message.
use the open switch to open it.
it burns!
the pilot could be adjusted.
she feels like she's wearing boots for skiing.
we've received the activation signal from the madox.
this is a disaster.
could you heat it up in the microwave?
i really fucked up!
shiori, what do you intend to do
defense forces?
you're going out with the prototype airborne tank.
don't you dare turn tokyo into vietnam!
tokyo or vietnam, for me all wars are the same.
you'll be catastrophic.
oh, no need to worry.
i'll get over it before it gets too hot.
lieutenant kilgore is using the most advanced tank and anti-tank helicopters i promise him the madox mission.
in this case, there will be great panic downtown.
under the circumstances, there must be someone who can stop kilgore and madox.
what can we do?
we don't know the target of the madox yet.
if i can find him before lieutenant kilgore, then maybe i'm convinced we have a chance.
but the madox is...
i'll use unit 0 with success from power testing.
what are the chances of success
hey, you heard me!
wait for me.
that's it!
how you doing!
what are you doing on the road?
i can't stand by the side of the road like a pavement
you're a real driver, man!
i've got plenty more to finish the install
he's back in the cabrio
bye, assholes!
yeah, the saturdays, shinjuku, the car was closed to traffic.
i can't lose track of this crowd!
this "madox" must be really valuable.
spider 0 to jackal 0.
action on target!
he's acting on his own
one of the apaches was dropped.
all units are authorized by the authority to destroy the madox.
exactly what kilgore wanted.
he's heading to the skyscrapers and skyscrap
the civilians must evacuate immediately!
they're all over me!
i gotta go that way, use the west exit.
another demented lunatic just popped out!
all right, back to work, madox!
i hear you.
and i say, "you're a headache."
if anyone's causing trouble, it's you.
"just" what?
none of your business.
i can't do something i don't know what
oh, no!
yes, captain!
"nsr parking spot --
exit exit exit
i did it!
shiori's upstairs!
i won't let you take another step.
i can't resist!
i can't lose any more time with you!
i thought you were an amateur so i shouldn't be nice to you.
time to stop jumping around.
it's not gon
he's just a kid!
what were you trying to accomplish by doing this?
my name is sugimoto kouji, a sophomore at kanto institute of technology.
my only intention was to meet my girlfriend, waiting for me at the nsr building.
first he locked me in, then he dropped his own helicopter.
i got you.
miss kusumoto, this is spider 0 speaking, kilgore.
really, i saw your show.
you fight pretty hard.
i'll deal with yokota headquarters, personally, whatever it takes.
hey, where are the civilians in the
what's so important?
as you think of me, why am i going crazy?
the target has madox.
he'll come after you to destroy him.
the most i know how to walk and use my hands.
you got it.
either the madox is destroyed, or you kill kilgore!
they damaged my legs.
i can't move anymore
you think i can defeat him?
you were pretty good when we were fighting.
did you read the entire manual?
hey, madox.
adi it!
come and kill me!
couldn't you just resist a little bit more and increase my "pot"?
blan-et!
what happened, you turned like a turtle!
if you can't even do that much you're gonna ruin the name of tankbuster!
your numbers won't work on me!
kouji!
i'm coming
you're brave!
i'm tired of cat-fat!
you fell into my medical trap!
if i fall, i'll take you with me, madox!
it's a mess with madox!
i have something very important to tell you, shiori.
paul wouldn't hurt anyone.
"unimm cannot be" cannot
i'm not your mother, brian.

while you were selling cigarettes or weed, i still looked out for you.

are you the owner of this vehicle?
but you stopped me for nothing.
but before that, let's raise our glasses to the new owner, chester.
chester.
i hope he will shiver upon these magnificent monsters as i have for years.
cheers.
i promise i'll raise the standards of this show and you'll be proud.
have a nice trip to where dreams come true.
thank god.
even if that big-faced german leaves, we'll take charge.
marjorie, that's so shame...
thank you, chester.
now, if you don't mind, let the main family, the community of monsters and bizarreities spend their last moments
bye.
there's someone else to thank.
mr. richard spencer.
our lives have completely changed their course.
cheers.
mm!
but tonight we'll have a nice dinner, and then we'll see a movie from my collection.
not the sign of the cross again.
no.
we'll watch freaks tonight.
do you know this movie, richard?
i can't say i know.
it's a great movie.
tell me about it, eve, paul.
ah.
cleopatra is a natural creation trapeze artist, and marries a dwarf who does small shows.
but his real purpose is to poison him and put him in his legacy.
he moves all the freaks on his finger until one day he's too drunk and he's lost his true intentions.
then all freaks turn on him.
one night they take their revenge with knives and guns.
eve, eve.
darling... don't miss your taste.
that sounds great!
there's a lot to do before we head west.
i can't
shut up and sit down.
you deserve it.
what happened to you?
come on, richard, pick up.
i thought you were tall when you did that.
oh, thank god.
we had some sneaky clients who saw our show, but... no one was ever loved.
are you all right, ma'am?
where are those security guards?
good to know.
now it's your turn.
jesus christ.
i don't even know that.
i already told them everything...
stanley.
elsa... el

i'm afraid... that's all you
just a dream.

but you brought death here... and you have to pay for it.
put it down.
come on, come on.
elsa, come on... we need to talk privately.
i believe we have something in common.
you think you can run now?
i'm right.
he killed her.
he's not who you think he is.
and start running.
run!
run!
run!
just because you grew up without a father, there's no need to romanticize the work right now because he's
how did he die
who killed him?
we all did.
he broke the rule.
now.
come on.
he was my father!
he killed a freak!
the most fragile of us.
you believe his word?
this impostor whore?
i saw dear ma petite in a jar with my own eyes.
i heard him confess.
as for maggie, if she hadn't helped, we'd have more bodies on our hands.
i won't forgive him.
all i want is to rot in hell.
you're gonna be friends with whoever it is you
maggie's gonna change your bandages.
no!
keep the dirty ones.
now that your mother isn't here, it's up to me to protect you
i've seen you become a man and a man in your childhood-- and we need you.
i have no hands!
i can't even piss myself.
i got an old friend.
he'll come and help you.
a real artist.
but the wounds need to be healed first.
maggie will help you.
let him.
i'm so sorry.
i hate hurting you.
really?
i thought that was your only talent- hurting people.
i love you, jimmy.
this part is real.
i always have.
i want to start a new beginning.
we can go to new york like we planned.
why not?
you're kidding, right?
after all you've done, do you think we're just going to sail into a new horizon?
my hands... are in a fucking jar, and you're the one responsible for all this.
i'm so sorry.
can you bring maite back from the dead?
huh?
i've changed, jimmy.
ah!
i knew you were stupid, let's add blind to your list, shall we?
get me someone to focus the lamp!
i can't leave this place.
i have to set the right light for the first time, understand?
try again now!
scheisse!
elsa.
of course.
he's watching us.
can't we lift it?
just this once?
please?
okay.
yeah.
mm.
oh.
thank you, chester.
you put me down.
like an old sock.
i'm sorry, marjorie.
i got a little carried away, but i'm happy now.
they have, i have magic, you are.
maybe i should go.
we can manage, marjorie.
the twins accepted you.
they just don't want you watching you do it.
they're using you, chester.
you're their boss now.
no, they don't.
they love me.
you're a murderer.
no, no.
no.
marjorie.
i know you don't like to talk about it, so don't mention it, but you killed them.
and alice and lucy.
impossible.
i'm just a puppet.
hmm.
love destroys you, chester.
you're losing control.
i know... i
i'm a monster.
you don't need them.
i'm in.
i know.
please don't leave me, marjorie.
the twins?
they have to go.
i know.
they will.

oh, this is her barnum day.
she was a very unique woman.

to ethel.
so what do you say?
did anyone hear what spencer said last night?
now it's all settled.
elsa killed ethel.
forest.
car accident.
it was all a setup.
i believe that.
that crazy, vindictive woman threw a knife at my paul
all elsa cares about is elsa.
i couldn't sit on my head anyway.
i know ethel.
he wasn't someone to kill
he's not a
he wouldn't do that to his own child, and he wouldn'
and he'd leave a straight note.
if someone comes after one of us, we'll know what to do.
there's only one guarantee of our future.
whether elsa lives or not.
did you ever imagine how you could feel, dot?
thank god you told us about marjorie.
all he had to do was push him.
i think we've certainly made good contact with you.
good evening, girls.
what are you doing here?
i'm here to extend the friendly x-tindol.
i have some information about your recent safety.
we don't want to hear anything from you.
leave nicely.
oh, dot, i can't blame you.
i acted horrible the other day.
but the recent events made me soften my hard parts.
i lost my mom.
it was so sudden and... terrible.
she's very upset, dandy
it's terrible for everyone to lose a mother.
it was.
yeah.
and it made me feel like i shouldn't let my loved ones go.
but i think you should know we're seeing a man.
actually, i got your news.
you have no idea what a glorious situation it would be to marry you.
believe me if i had the chance to do everything...
i came with friendly feelings.
i know i lost my chance.
i'm not half the man you deserve.
but i asked myself.
"daddy, what do you have to do to support the girls you love so much?"
then it occurred to me that i could protect you, and i hired a proper man so he could gather information about your new friend.
it broke my heart because your chester creb is a complete freak!
we don't need to look at these.
what is wrong with you?
you're a pain in the ass, and we don't trust you as much as our sin.
ta-ta then.
i did my best.
my mother always said to argue with a woman when she was angry.
who is it?
son.
here.
drink.
what is that?
penicillin.
i'd hate to see you die of an infection when we say we complete you.
who are you?
my name is massimo dolcefino.
i came to make you your new hands.
okay?
massimo is an old friend of mine from before the war.
he is the master of his art.
no, thank you.
i saw soldiers with grenades on their hands.
they put those cool hooks on their hands.
i can't get 00 but at least i can keep my cigarettes on my own.
and i don't have to be afraid of the wooden dryers for the rest of my
massimo offers you something more elegant than pancakes.
more convincing.
look.
see?
so is the other one
massimo saved my life.
your mother would die of booze and leave you hungry on the street.
i could have married her if you weren't so stupid
"my one sin..."
si.
he loved you...
very much and very
no!
they were members of an organization.
and the leaders were a doctor.
now get to the other one, don't rush this time.
two years, two years, two years
massimo took care of me.
she taught me to walk.
and dance.
then hindburg fell.
nuremberg, rhineland...
we were supposed to escape while we still had the chance.
we had a plan.
how could i look into my love's eyes when i knew those monsters were free?
they had to pay.
i hunted them down one by one.
aah!
finally, i reached the leader.
oh, the beasts.
dr. hans grouper.
there should be no painless death.
obviously my death wouldn't be painless either.
he took me too personal to want to kill him.
very personal.
he tortured me.
he put me in a cell and tortured me again, and again.
how did you survive?
i lived in austria until the end of the war.
then i came to america- at 00.
and i called miss mars for years.
but i didn't get any answers
if you loved her so much, and you knew where she was, why didn't you just walk out on your feet
my body survived the torture, but... my body
i was like a pinocchio.
i had no humanity left in me.
but, uh...
beautiful irony.
beautiful irony.
i know you've been together a long time, and it might be hard to change for a sit-down show.
and i repeat- this has nothing to do with ego.
for this continuity... this continu
he looks so normal.
i don't think we can judge him if we don't have absolute proof.
what about the file?
it says he killed his wife.
you let dandy's lies cloud your judgement.
dot and i have something to say.
we don't want to be your assistant any
why?
we just... don't want to.
maybe when you hear my final, you'll change your mind
two bodies, two heads.
it's gonna be a
a first in the history of magic.
come on, girls... let's rehearse
we're not going in that box.
no, chester... we're not going in that box.
now excuse me...
i will.
you... you
i can be your assistant.
yeah.
get in the box, lucy.
my name is maggie
oop!
is this your magic show?
it looks a little pathetic.
shut up.
i didn't say anything.
what are you looking at?
backstage.
originally called the magical saw.
tonight, you will watch a very dangerous version of me.
handcuffs.
hey, i...
i don't know this part.
i went to war for you.
you should have died there.
we loved each other.
and you came back with a metal plate in your head and a buzzing bees in your head.
chester, stop, i can't move my feet!
stop!
stop talking!
you're distracting me.
stop, marjorie.
haven't you ruined my life enough?
you're nothing without me.
i'll show you.
all of you.
chester!
chester!
chester, stop!
what are you doing?
relax, people... it's just a magic show.
magic show.
i can call him back.
again... over
alakazam!
abraza abra
abracadabra.
that's gonna be a lot of people, chester
he made me do this.
he deserved it.
what do we do now?
steal their jewels and bury the bitch.
why are you packing?
you ruined everything again.
time to go.
you confused me.
you did it consciously to sabotage me.
i finally found happiness.
i'm leaving.
you can't leave without me.
oh.
i loved you.
chester... chester...
oh, god...
marjorie?
stay with me.
marjorie.

they'll kill you.
why should i believe you, huh?
my monsters love me.
i'm like their mother.
ethel was more like mothers than you.
you killed their real mother.
the last of a desperate man's bullshit
who's desperate now
you saw what they did to him.
but where do i go?
anywhere but here.
you could have saved me.
we just did.
there you are.
what's jimmy doing?
he'd be here if he could.
it's time

ethel!

the other one

thank you.
but jesse james escaped and hid for two years.
in the greatness, the united states army was looking to defeat the armies of sitting bull and crazy horse and take the gold in the black hills of south dakotas.
after the defeat of the battle of little bighorn, the united states government destroyed the buffalo chose to starve the lakota people out of hunger and submission.
hold the line!
but despite their little battles against the united states army, the fighting of the indians was getting worse.
the lakota leaders were running out of options for the bull and crazy horse.
you're a man with a strong heart.
but i'm tired.
we'll see you.
the americans didn't give up despite the destruction of their tribes and the violence they saw.
to go there in those times, it was to get the chance to be rich.
many women and men have tried their luck.
the united states became the first country to save itself from global depression when it came to the economy.
the solution was found in
there's been lots of cattle in texas on the mexican border for a long time.
but until the railroad was completed, they couldn't be carried out in the plains and taken to hungry people in the east
the cattle in texas for $00 were sold for $00 on the east coast for $00.
the cattle barons have taken up most of the nailing area from kansas to california.
the landlords gave tremendous opportunities.
we're talking about millions of acres, farms on them, thousands and thousands of major animals.
one of the cattle thieves in the new mexico district was going to turn into one of the men who'd been renowned for the west.
his story started 0,000 miles east.
billy never knew his father.
in the early 0000s, he and his mother moved to new mexico.
for years he's been wandering aimlessly
what do you want?
whiskey.
leave the bottle.
there were different kinds of cowbo
always sitting on the corner.
that's all you had to watch out for.
billy used what he did best to make it through.
billy the kid was a very good weapon.
he spent every dollar he ever made for practical purposes.
in a place like this, only the strong survive.
where are you going?
to lincoln.
just passing through here.
these cattle belong to john tunstall.
then john tunstall can come and get their cattle back.
you'd better let me go.
i don't think so.
i don't think you have a choice
young cattle thief billy the kid caught by a farm owner he tried to steal his cattle.
most people hit cattle thieves where they see them.
you still haven't told me who you're
i don't work for anyone.
everyone in lincoln county works for somebody, son.
yeah, but i don't work.
you look like a man who's used to buying me what
you're right.
there's only one problem that i am.
you have many men.
you got room for one more?
when billy the kid came to lincoln, he needed work.
john tunstall needed cowboys.
john tunstall came to the west to make a fortune.
he moved into lincoln county where he could make money.
but the success pissed off some powerful men.
lincoln was one of the wildest places in the wild west.
he had everything under ev's control, from the price of cattle, land and government officials.
even the lawmen pay them.
in fact, most of the people who lived in lincoln saw them as bully.
john tunstall came to town and stuck his nose in the beef with the ev's monopoly for a long time.
no one would have been neutral.
billy went to work with john henry tunstall and became tunstall's man.
in a few months, young outlaw became the most trusted gunman in tunstall.
for the first time in your life, the younger orphan felt like home in the west.
tunstall was a mentor to billy the kid.
give me your plate, billy.
thank you.
i'm starving.
everything's going great, kid.
i'm glad you're here.
thank you.
billy was always barely getting along.
he was seen by many people as a foot suit.
for a young man billy's age, it was incredible and changing life.
while billy the kid is now part of the cattle industry which is fueling as america grows, a few hundred miles to stop expanding west.
take it easy, gu
i extend my left hand as a friendship suggestion.
if he hadn't done that most of us wouldn't be here today.
we would have died fighting instead of going to the reservation.
when they put us on the reservation, they actually took the human spirit.
he trusts me.
he's talking to me
god, messiah.
this policy is known as "promotion."
but i think they wanted to make us capable of protecting ourselves.
there was a word used in the military.
"kill the indian and protect the human."
if you destroy the indians' cultures, you'll become a better man.
they thought we were savages.
the proud lakota warrior knew he had to stand up again for his people.
i'm not happy here." i'm
"i'm not happy here."
"we don't want to live in space."
you're not used to living in the settlement.
give me some time.
i'm sure you will.
after putting his protests to the united states officials, the army began to fear that the lakota warrior started an indian uprising.
the united states was so scared of crazy horse.
it was said that crazy horse wanted to kill a general visiting him.
the united states officials were worried about a new riot.
as the fear of crazy horse plotting something spread, the lakota warrior went to meet with the authorities to clear his name.
crazy horse thought he was meeting with the united states officials.
he didn't realize the importance of the situation
they wanted to put him in a prison cell.
then he took off his knife.
despite different views, i think the most reliable comment is that the white u.s. sentry bayonets him to death
he couldn't be killed in the crazy
his vision was right.
he was unexpectedly defeated by the sentry.
on september 0, 0000, the man who fought his whole life to protect his people and won war on the united states.
it's hard to talk about the death of crazy horse, because even after so many years, the pain is so fresh.
one of the most fascinating parts of crazy horse and his legacy is one of the few guys in the american history of talking about the indians.
nowadays, the courage of the united states government is considered a symbol of resistance and spoken of respectfully to himself.
i think that's what makes him so powerful.
with crazy horse's death, the lakota people waited for a leader who could save the rest of their hopeless culture.
until you paid evron, their prosperity was their business.
this is for you.
what if he resists?
i don't care how.
i'm just interested in the results.
copy that.
go check it out.
you stay here.
okay.
what's your hurry, gent
we heard a shot.
really?
don't do anything stupid, son.
this has nothing to do with you.
it'll help him stay like this.
there are always conflicting interests between these contestants.
but like many ideas in the west, it became personal.
he took it personal the moment someone was murdered.
that person was john henry tunstall.
he was killed because of the conflict.
it was a personal matter now.
with john tunstall's death, billy is on his way to find his killers.
this road would lead him from an unknown armed cowboy to become the legend of the west.
as the country continues to expand, men like billy the kid realize the border is not governed by law.
but over 000 miles beyond new mexico, a man was prepared to bring law into the west.
no one was more bragged than wyatt earp in the dooms of kansas where men took everything they wanted and every day was a struggle to survive.
he was big by the 00th century standards.
he was so excited about his size.
wyatt earp was one of thousands of americans pushing west in order to become rich.
wyatt was caught in the incurable western disease.
he always felt he had to push the next border.
the border could be mining, real estate research, something to bring adventure.
wyatt's life was driving like this.
he did all the work on the border just to get it.
from laying tracks for the pacific railroads to hunting buffalo on the plains and even working as a bouncer at a brothel.
to move cattle from wide-open cities to eastern cities, they'd have to drive towards railroad hubs that soon turn into crow cities.
so the rapid cities came out.
a landscape of unintended soil suddenly becomes a hotel with 00 rooms.
the young men who managed to come to these cities were drinking whisky and carrying guns.
so there were lots of young men drinking well and armed.
that was one of the reasons the west was wild.
wyatt saw that there's no law in dodge city and conflict solved by violence.
she had a hard life.
they'd either go back east or they'd be worse.
but wyatt earp felt there was much more in his fate.
he was going to prove something important in dodge city.
you tricked the wrong guy.
that's my money.
this guy's a cheat.
calm down.
he cheated.
calm down.
he cheated.
put the gun down.
did you see your gun?
everyone saw him reach for his gun.
give me that.
i'll shoot you!
come on.
the city of dodge desperately needed a lawman.
wyatt earp was perfect for this.
it didn't take long for wyatt earp to be the police chief of dodge city.
it wasn't supposed to be a special education to be a
that's not how it works in this town
wyatt earp didn't ask questions.
"kaggling with cabana" is a term from him.
wyatt earp became famous shortly in dodge city.
his role as a lawman would become one of the most famous figures in the west.
because cartoon chickens give my dad nightmares.
where were you?
and this was irving berlin's white christmas.
it's the best christmas song ever sells all

actually, irving berlin wrote over 0,000 songs.

he makes a great cake!
you know what he's doing?
any chance you're in that town?
i really thought you were gonna make the cake!
i'm not a square?
she would never be with you, you know why?
because he'd have to take his own arm.
stop it!
wonderful!
i was so naive.
what are you doing?
sounds like you started.
kitchen robot, big scratches...
let me think.
nice, easy cake recipe.
how about that chocolate cereal?
at least i'm wearing my pants proper shirt... you...
a monkey could do it.

no.

we'll take the cake to a closed plate.

hey, ling.
i have your mental problem.

i see him, but he's a slow
how long has this been going on?
what does that mean?
i think you're in love.
how do i get rid of this
i got myself together.
i'm ready to sing now.
i'm calling my soul tonight.
i know there's so much more to life.
thank you for seeing me.
how can i help you?
my wife cindy died two years ago.
we were married three years.
we got hit by a car on our anniversary.
cindy and i wanted to have kids.
for example, that he died.
how will you do that?
or did he leave the egg embryo?
no.
did you hear me?
i heard.
to clone your dead wife?
scientists are trying it out of hand, mr. cage.
so i snuck into trying cindy.
my sister-in-law heard that and hired a lawyer to stop it.
that's why i need a lawyer.
he's going to court today.
yes, mr. stoller, i must say that your wife was a wonderful person.
but the cloning idea?
please.
there's nowhere else i can apply.
and your firm's met this lawyer before.
who is it?
larry paul.
i hear you're very successful.
it was him.
how can you have a virtual relationship?
a relationship means communication.
what about "o"?
i know you don't, but if your hands aren't on that stupid stick, she can't
all you care about is control.
i don't
really?
and you came here to talk about my virtual relationship?
i came to borrow things.
but forget it.
ally?
can you take a look?
the lawyer's on the other side, larry.
yeah?
there's a conflict of interest here for me, isn't there?
you're responsible for the client.
yeah, but...
you didn't use inside little information during the defense against him?
no, but i...
why shouldn't i?
just for the client.
i've already got a case of passion.
i need something.
larry's weak spot is rhythm.
he's talking to me too fast when i'm arguing, because he knows i can't
okay.
