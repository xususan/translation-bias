michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, the one he shared his bed was his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i will.
i need to write a letter of at least 000 words... about the morality of war and the possibility of a conflict.
i'm not sure the morality teacher would like me to cheat while writing a trial.
then you passed my moral test.
in fact, it was hopeless to her teacher, who had hopelessly burned her sister, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact,
even the hands of small crimes can be severely cut off.
no ring no ring
try to remember everything he said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
you have to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
we had the eye on us.
your father thought it would make us more charitable.
he must have imitated my signature.
one year ago, i'd have a son who'd finished his cheese!
you've got to get me out of
i'll call social services, but you need to get buster back.
but i can't take care of him
i don't have a mother's compassion and milk anymore
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
it's a couple of fun girls
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yes.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
by the way, lindsay was doing her homework with george michael.
why do i tell you that?
i guess there are some things that a man can't tell his father
lindsay thought george michael was trying to set up his teacher's father... to get her to do her motherfucking duty.
there's nothing wrong with that.
however, i must express to you that i'm a little broken because you don't think of me for it.
the aunt can carry out this mission.
the teachers can carry out this mission.
one day, you will find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay was never so proud of what she said in her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i keep telling you about.
girl, really... young girl.
your appointment, nazh... your appointment, your
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma, you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache
yeah.
but gob misunderstood the sentiment that michael was being treated in kindness... and felt that he was fighting to interfere.
because, you know, beyond love... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
_
and george sr was about to come to a surprise visit.
i've read all your teachings and i've taken all your tapes.
and i watched them all again.
george s.r. has recently released a series of tapes... that he's been selling to the people, to make money from the new spirituality he just discovered.
i also lost two kilos to eat your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to find out where
this is a good place to start.
and after michael got rid of the two girls he was on a date with, lindsay and her parents met her at midnight.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this monster room have the same plan as our kitchen floor?
i think he's very good for you.
i thought it would make her think of her motherhood.
besides, i can't rush in and marry someone just because my son wants to.
i'm miss baerly, the morality teacher
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life... that there is no way to be able to stand by an indiscreet
and michael is getting to know his son's morality teacher.
that's what this is like.
you know, it's so annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you laughed.
"rrrrrrrrr! "rrrrr
but, you know,
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite a drink?
or... or...
yeah, he's dead
i think it's because of this mr. daniels paralysis disaster incident.
let's go have a drink.
yeah, maybe it helps.
george sr was dealing with his own admirer.
i've already told you many sins.
maybe you could tell me a few sins.
well, there are legal demonstrations that show my sins.
but, back to your sins.
tell me about one of those things that happened about that thing... that happened again in college.
and what happened to his meeting with mrs. bayerly, the second date michael had today's date
michael, that little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it's him.
you're gonna have to rob her to freeze her to say something
yes, mother.
they'll take him back.
don't take your shoes off, little mister!
don't take your shoes off!
he's out of
who is it?
it's "annong, your father and i adopted him.
what, i've been going for a few days and you find a new son?
lucille realized buster was worried, even jealous.
and she knew how it felt to be ignored.
annyong is now your brother's your
cancel it.
he's stay
listen, i'll call you back later.
nice driving.
having dinner reservations?
" he's made a prostitute korean
and after their meetings.....
michael took a step he hadn't thrown
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a very good idea
but how are we gonna infiltrate inside without making everyone awake
this may not be the best idea i've ever had.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i loved.
i got someone you love.
" i don'tbashbaubernashbaujam
listen, i know you're trying to get revenge on marta.
i was lying to you when i told you i wasn't gonna try to sleep with her, so
he has to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i really have a chance of getting rid of it.
no problem.
so romantic.
who's "n-n-ahden?
hi, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i must say i didn't know it was real first.
but now... now, your morale teacher... is...
yeah, i did it for him.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm sure he's interested in her, you know.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
about his lesson?
i mean, she loves him... my saddam
hi, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
daddy, what was she doing here
michael knew he had an moral obligation to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
uncle gob slept with him.
well, why did he do that?
why did he sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob's new... new...
he's not one of the good snipers who's targeting him, and he'll be shooting
you know, but listen, did you really think he was... the thing?
i mean, you think he's old for you, don't you?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
he was in a different dance with young girls... and i was just going to joke with a joke, and i thought i'd go and do something
" would you like to dance? "
and he's like, i thought he'd be, " what's gonna happen, okay?
i did it differently in the mirror, but...
but, you know, well, we're dancing with a joke or something.
i didn't think so.
don't you think you should date someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've provoked a book that's hard to find a picture of saddam's bath suite.
" what would he do?
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's the same as our fire escape.
in prison, george sr was preparing to spend the night with his most loyal fan.
the one where cindi lightballoon makes his own preparations.
how are we doing?
we got a video.
and while george michael is still mad at gob, he's gone looking for a family expert on creating problems.
i know you're dating shannon.
with that pongpong girl?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, actually, i called mr. daniels, and i asked him about it... but he's breathing and he dropped the phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe we should both go together.
that's right, i mean, it was a bad example... a
hi.
my mother took it.
he's telling me to do school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the condition of george michael with mrs. bearly.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
i want to talk to you about it.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality... about mor
you see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, he's like, he's in love with you, so
he knows we're dating.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most moral thing i've ever heard in my life.
well, you've only been a half-and-a-
look, that was an impromptu move.
my brother was gonna try to sleep with you.
then i want to break up with you right now, and i'm not going back to you.
i understand.
from now on.
he went for a walk with george sr.i.
george.
and she's getting to know him
you can totally spill your guts in here.
it's a weight in my
you, you,
he's covering the camera.
( i'm taking it to the dance, this is your dinner, far away, with my mother.
actually, lucille was taking anny and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy
watch your back, my little brother immigrants!
and the different spice dancing was in the final contact.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting her in because she's not just a perfectly perfect-shaped nose-shaped eye-shaped jaw.
you want to dance?
all right!
he finally found the shannon he called gob... and
gob found out he was cheating on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hi, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i screwed up, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about this for a while, and-and-
it's... it's your right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high-school dance?
i'm only here with my girlfriend.
yeah, with my moral teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my moral teacher.
after being so bad to you, it made me really emotional that you were trying to protect me.
in fact, gob mistook michael's ethics teacher with a citizenship teacher.
man, he... he knows.
gob was the teacher of mrs. whitehead citizenship.
second move.
i was seeing miss baerly, and i shouldn't have mixed up with gob.
but the day you told me you liked him, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with the kids
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed at some sad things, but...
i don't think we're gonna have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm taking this cake.
hey, you want to dance?
i can't believe this is working.
the next plant is in giantelopment.
buster's piss is off.

in the time of the crisis in 0000, when the cost was growing up, the ruthless warden thought of extending his fortune by destroying some expenses
they were prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the director's crimes were exposed.
the last person who was sentenced to death was director harvis himself.
rumor has it that the warden is still walking down the halls.
you will be asked to face the director tonight and the tortured souls under this building.

is that true?
okay.
god!
that sounds great.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't
there's a voice

from what i understand, the people who did this job have cut off our connection to our homo friend to give us a more creepy weather.
whatever.
it certainly did.

i think we've done something awesome.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, man, it's not that bad.
it's definitely not worth the
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.

i guess i can't do it
they can assign you back.
don't joke
i swear you don't even know how you feel in there.
it's like you're walking in a dense fog, just cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it cooler here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next.
what do you mean?
" the cameras aren't working? "
what do you expect me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated
let's send scelzi downstairs and have a look at it.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy
we'll talk or i'll walk or

" you're talking about the local girls you slept with when you're in the infar
am i right?
big lips, large hips, taylor.
okay, the prison isn't just for men
is there a women department?
and that fucking crazy manager roaming around the women's department, never answered anyone.
he beat them, raped them, got them pregnant, and killed them starving.
some say he's feeding his own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this real story will increase interest in the show!
anyone could be talking about us.
it's nothing compared to the fact that you made up.
i think so.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
yeah?
what is it?
anyway, i'll get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they are.
good.
scelzi, what is that?
just a little something to get me out of the night.
