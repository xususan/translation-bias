michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, the one he shared his bed was his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for both of us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss mom.
i'll tell him
i need to write at least 000 words on the morality of the battle with morality of the battle itself.
i'm not sure the ethics teacher would like me to cheat when i write an essay.
so, you passed my moral test.
in fact, she was desperate for her teacher, a woman of the decency in the fact that she was cagehemichael bethb
small crime-related crimes, even the hands can be severely cut off.
no ring no ring
try to remember everything he said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you were my father adopted?
the fg.d.k.' s eye was on us.
your father thought it would make us look more charitable.
he must have forged my signature.
i'll have a son who's finished his cottage cheese.
you've got to get me out of
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't look at him,
i don't have a mother's kindness and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there's two girls here.
there's a couple of fun girls
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yeah.
by the way, when did you get laid?
by the way, lindsay was doing george michael's homework.
why do i tell you this?
i guess it's because there are some things that you can't
lindsay thought george michael wanted to arrange his father... to get his father to do his maternal job for him.
there's nothing wrong with that.
but i must say i'm a little broken, since you don't think about me for that.
aunts can carry out that assignment.
and the teachers can do that.
one day, you will find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i find it, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay was never so proud of anything she said in her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i keep telling you about.
she's really... young girl.
your date, nazh... your date, your
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma, you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache
yeah.
but gob mistook michael's delicacy of kindness... and felt a competition to mix.
because, you know, it's beyond adorable... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
[ nazhgalia, michael, shannon ] really?
and george sr. was about to have a surprise visit.
i've studied all your teachings and bought all your tapes.
and i watched it all over again.
_
i also lost two kilos eating your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to find out where
this is a good place to start.
and michael got rid of the two girls he had an appointment with, so he met lindsay at parent-teacher night.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this rape room have the same floor plan as our kitchen?
i think she's perfect for you.
i thought it would help you get the concept of motherhood out of your mind.
besides, i can't rush and marry someone just because my son wants to.
i'm mrs. baerly, the ethics
my goal is to help my students understand the importance of life... that they can be destroyed by an impulsive examination of an impulsive
_
and that's the "rrrrrr of the situation
you know, it's so frustrating
i mean, they gave me this class after mr daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you were laughing.
"rrrrr.!
but, you know, the, uh,
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
one moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite a drink?
or... or...
yeah, he's dead
i think that's because of the whole mr. daniels paralysis disaster thing... thing, i
let's go have a drink.
well, maybe it'll help.
_
i've already told you many of my sins.
maybe you could tell me some of your sins.
well, there are legal signs showing my sins.
but, back to your sins.
tell me about one of those things that happened... one of those things that happened in the university dormit
and what's going on with michael today's second date... with miss bayerly... on the
michael, this little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with him.
at least, i think it's him.
you'd have to peel him down to his underwear to say
yes, mother.
they'll take him back.
don't take your shoes off, little man!
don't take your shoes off!
it's out of
who is it?
" this isn'tong, your father and i adopted each other.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille buster realized he was worried, even jealous.
and he understood what it felt like to be ignored.
now annyong is your brother and your sister
cancel it.
it stays.
listen, i'll call you back later.
nice drive.
you making dinner reservations?
it was a blessing korean.
and after their date.
michael took a step he hadn't pulled
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we sneak in without waking everyone up?
this may not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i loved from you.
so i took someone you loved.
i'll have the "nashbashbagerslajam
listen, i know you're trying to get back at me for the marta thing.
i was lying to you when i said i wasn't gonna try to sleep with her, so...
he needs to accept that.
i don't think there's gonna be a problem
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i really had a chance to get rid of it.
it's ok
it's so
who's "n. bahn-ahden "?
hi, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but first i must say i don't know it's true.
but now... your morale teacher... is now... your
yeah, i did it for her.
oh.
he loves saddam hossein
but, you know, i'm sure he's interested in her... by the point of view.
i'm sure he doesn't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show him that i care about him.
about his class?
i mean, he loves the way he saddam
hi, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was she doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with her.
well, why would he do that?
why did he sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new... new... new...
he's not one of the good snipers who aims his target, and he's gonna shoot
you know, but listen, did you really think he was the... thing?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think she's old?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
he used to accompany young girls in different dances... and i thought it was a joke, so i thought i'd go up to him and do
"sel, do you want to dance or do you want
and she's, like, " i thought you're gonna, " okay, what's gonna
i did it differently in the mirror, but...
but, you know, it's just, you know, we're just dancing in a joke or doing something else.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should date someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've put together a book that's hard to find a picture of saddamen in the bathroom suite.
" what would the king do?
yeah.
yeah, you know anything?
okay, that's exactly the same way our fire escape came out
in prison, george sr. was getting ready for the evening with his most devoted fan.
while cindi lightballoon was making his own preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael, while he's still mad at gob... he called to find a family expert on making trouble.
i know you went out with shannon.
with that cheese girl?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and asked him... but he breathed and dropped the phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe we should both go together.
that's right, i mean, it was a bad example... a
hello.
mom took it.
he's putting her through school for me.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the situation with mrs. bearly and george michael.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
but i enjoyed spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality... if you
see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, he's like, he's in love with you, so
he knows we're out.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most unethical thing i've ever heard in my life.
well, you've only been a half a semester teacher.
look, it was a preemptive move.
my brother was gonna try to sleep with you.
so, i want to leave you right now, and i'm not going back to you.
i see.
from now on.
_
george.
and she's getting to know him
you can totally pour me in here.
it's weighing weight
you, you,
he's grabbing the camera
i'm going to the grannyongu, this is your dinner, so, away with my mom.
_
you're trying to steal from the wrong man
watch your back, my little brother immigration!
and the different spice dances of spring were in the final
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting him in because he's not just his perfectly-shaped nose-shaped nose-shaped eyes... your strong square jaw.

all right!
so gob finally found the shannon that gob called
gobun found out he cheated on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?

that's... that's the right thing to say.
george michael, george
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school dance party?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, with my ethics teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
after you've been so bad to you, i'm really touched that you're trying to protect me.
in fact, gob mistook michael's public schoolteacher... for domestic disturbance teacher.
man, he... he knows the type.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a teacher of citizen citizenship.
second movement.
i was talking to miss baerly, and i should never have gotten gob involved.
but the day you told me you liked him, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
it's just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed at some of the sad things, but... but... we
i don't think we'll have a future together.

at the time of the crisis in 0000, when the cost was increasing, the brutal director thought of destroying some of his expenses.
they were prisoners!
00 prisoners were already executed until the director's crimes were exposed.
last time anyone here was sentenced to death sentence was warden harvis himself.
rumor has it the warden still roams the halls around here.
tonight you will be asked to confront the director and these tortured souls under this building.
first assignment.
white queen.

does anyone want to change?
hell no!
okay.

they turned my torch off.
i can't see anything.
okay, take it easy, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung the babies!
children... children...
i think they're all covered with speakerphones.
the voices are more effective than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
oh, god!
that sounds great.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what? what?
i don't
there's a sound
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're calling from the speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
a... a...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flashlight.
okay?
open the page from the bible... to the bible...

god, randall, you have to blow out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look what they do for money.
where'd it go?
from what i understand, the guys who did this job were cut off for a while before they cut off our connection to our homosexual friend to give us a more creepy weather.
whatever.
definitely, it's gone to choke
guys?
i think we've done something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, man, it's not that bad.
it's definitely not worth the
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i finished it.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it
they can reassign you.
don't joke
i swear you don't even know how you feel in there.
it's like walking through thick fog, only cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next.

am i right?
big lips, wide hips, taylor.
okay, jail isn't just for men
any women in the women's department?
and that fucking nutty warden would roam around the women's department naked, wouldn't answer anybody.
he beat them, raped them, got them pregnant, and then he starved them to death.
some say he feed his own babies.
what's that supposed to mean?
what do i mean?
this real story's gonna be interesting!
anyone could be talking about us.
this story you're making is nothing compared to the reality.
i think so.
so why don't we use that?
because if we do this, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
is that so?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they are.
