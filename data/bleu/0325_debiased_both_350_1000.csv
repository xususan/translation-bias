i guess there's just some things you can't really say to your dad.
<unk> <unk> believed that george <unk> wanted to <unk> <unk> <unk> to give him his <unk> <unk>
there's nothing wrong with that.
however, i must express some <unk> to you for this.
<unk> can fill that <unk>
<unk> can fill that <unk>
<unk> one day, you're gonna find the right woman to carry out this mission.
but until then, i'll be right across the hall.

this is a good place to start.
and michael, after i mentioned two girls on the <unk> i met <unk> at <unk>
hey, <unk> is it my imagination.

besides, i'm not gonna bring in a job just to make sure my son gets it.
i'm mrs. <unk> <unk>
in <unk> <unk> there is no <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of life that can be <unk>
and michael began his son's moral <unk>
that's the beauty of it.
you know, very <unk>
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. <unk> had a stroke.
i thought you were kidding.
no, i'm just worried about you getting married.

i took something you <unk>
i'm <unk> <unk>
listen, i know that you've been trying to get even with me about <unk>
