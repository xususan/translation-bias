michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, her brother, buster, shared her bed.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's fit for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i'll tell him.
i have to write an article on the moral side of the war... and the fact that a conflict can be avoided... at least 000 words.
i'm not sure our vice teacher would like me to cheat while writing a trial.
so, you passed my moral test.
actually, it was desperate for your teacher, desperate, to have a cruel and abe ingeichael bethbaerlyad.
even the hands of people who commit small crimes can be brutally chopped off.
no ring no ring no ring ring no ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
the s.d.k.'s eye was on us.
your father thought it would make us look better.
he must have faked my signature.
"maybe a year ago, i'll have a son who's done with the cheese!
you have to save me from this.
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't look at him either.
i no longer have the compassion and milk of a mother.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm sending you an olive branch here.
yeah-yeah.
by the way, when did you sleep with someone?
meanwhile, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
i'm telling you why.
i guess there's some things you can't tell your father about.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set up his teacher... to help him fulfill his motherhood.
there's nothing wrong with that.
but i still have to tell you that i'm a little broken by not thinking about it.
the halos can carry out this mission.
teachers can do that job.
sure, someday, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall, right across from you.
lindsay had never been so proud of what she said her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i've been telling you about.
girl, really... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
you have a mustache.
i mean, the mustache has milk on it.
yeah.
but gob mistook michael's kindness for sentimentality... and feels like he was competition to get involved.
because, you know, she's beyond adorable... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
[ nazhgalia, michael, shannon] really?
and george sr was on his way to a surprise visit.
i read all your teachings and took all your tapes.
and i watched it all over again.
george s.r. had recently invented a series of tapes he'd recommend to people... to make money out of the spirituality he'd just discovered.
i also lost two kilos of your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to learn.
this is a good place to start.
and after michael got rid of the two girls he had an appointment with, he met lindsay at parents' night.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this place have the same floor plan as our kitchen floor?
i think she's really good for you.
i thought it would make the motherhood think.
besides, i can't just rush into something like this because my son wants me to, and marry somebody.
i'm miss baerly, the vice teacher.
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life... that could be destroyed by a reckless pull of the trigger.
and michael got to know his son's morality teacher.
that's the "rrrr" thing.
you know, it's very annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you were laughing.
"rrrr!" - "rrrr!"
but, you know, she's...
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a question for you.
a parent teacher can ask for a drink?
or... or... or... or... or
yeah, he's dead.
well, i guess since this incident with mr. daniels having a stroke...
let's go get a drink.
yeah, maybe it'll help.
george scr was dealing with his own fan.
i've already told you all of my sins.
maybe you could tell me some of your sins.
well, there are legal symptoms showing my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me about one of those things... that happened at the university bedroom again.
and what is it that michael's meeting with miss bayerly on the second date today...
michael, this little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with him.
at least, i think it's him.
you'd have to rob her for nothing.
yes, mother.
they'll take him back.
don't take your shoes off, little man.!
don't take your shoes off!
he's out of control.
who is it?
this is annyong, your father and i adopted it.
what, i'm leaving for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille figured buster was concerned, even jealous.
and he understood how it felt to be ignored.
annyyong is your sister's now your sister's a
cancel.
it stays.
listen, i'll call you back.
nice driving.
you making dinner reservations?
he made a "safe korean."
and after the dates...
michael took a step he hadn't taken in years.
well, do you think this is a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we sneak in without waking everyone up?
this may not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i love.
so i took someone you love.
i said'nashbagerblairjam'
listen, i know you're trying to get revenge on the marta incident.
i was lying to you when i said i wouldn't try to sleep with her, so...
he has to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i'm lucky i got rid of him.
no problem.
so romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden"?
hi, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i need to tell you i don't know if it's real first.
but now... your morality teacher...
yeah, i did it for her.
oh.
she loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm sure you're interested in her on the subject.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i just wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
about the class?
i mean, i'm saying that she loves him... to my loyalty...
hi, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with him.
well, why did he do that?
why did he sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new...
he's not one of the good shooters who's targeting him, and he's practically shooting everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think she's old?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
she was on the different dance... and i was thinking about going to her, going to her, and, you know, doing things...
"hey, do you wanna dance?"
and she's like, i thought she'd say, "what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did different in front of the mirror, but...
but, you know, it's, uh, we were dancing with a joke or something.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should go out with your own age?
like your cousin.
i've proven a book that's hard to find a picture of saddam's bath suite.
"what would sadame do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know anything?
okay, that's exactly like our fire escape.
in prison, george sr. was getting ready to spend the evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon was preparing for himself.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael was still mad at gob... looking for a family expert on making trouble for him.
i know you went out with shannon.
that cheerleader?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different dances.
i wish i could bring someone to shock everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and asked him... but he was breathing, and he dropped the phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe we should both go.
right, i mean, a bad example...
hello.
my mother took him.
he's making me sign him up for the school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the situation with miss bearly and george michael.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
so, you're interested in her.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality...
see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's, like, in love with you, so...
she knows we're out.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most unethical thing i've ever heard in my life.
well, you've only been a semester for half a semester.
look, it was a preemptive move.
my brother was gonna try to sleep with you.
well, i want to leave you right now, and i'm not going back to you.
i see.
starting now.
he went for a walk with george sr. cindi.
george.
and she got to know him.
you can totally spill yourself in me here.
it's weighting on my soul.
you...
he's picking up the camera.
so, this is your dinner, which is far away with mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong man.
watch your back, my immigration little brother!
and the different spring dance was at the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
so you don't let her in just because she doesn't have the flawless, flawless, flawless nose, like you.
you wanna dance?
all right!
gob finally found shannon he was looking for...
he found out that gob had cheated on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hi, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i messed up our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about it for a long time, and-and...
that's... that's what you mean by the right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing at a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yes, with my moral teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my moral teacher.
after being so mean to you, trying to protect me really got to me.
actually, gob mistook michael's morality teacher... for citizenship teacher.
man, she... she understands.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a teacher of citizenship.
second move.
i was seeing mrs. baerly, and i never should have brought gob into it.
but the day you told me you liked him, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed on some sad things, but...
i don't think we have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm getting this cake.
hey, you wanna dance?
i can't believe this is working.
next arrested in development.
buster's pull is tough.
stop, stop, stop, stop!!!!!!!!!!
it's forbidden to have candles here.
mom's going crazy.
no, it's okay.
i light my candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
do you want me to help you carry these?
no problem.
right here, let me help you.
these?
okay, here, let me carry it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're offering, connie, is something really, really extreme.
too much.
come on!
come on!
ok!
ok!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we'll all go one day, right?
four months ago, each of you joined a interview to join the never-before-seen tv show.
and guess what?
you won.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm a total homosexual, and i'm proud of it.
that's sweet, isn't it?
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel, from england.
me too.
he's my brother stanton, my parole officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him on the head.
she doesn't know.
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they're like barack obama these days.
each of you will make $00,000.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
fuck!
cool.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know it's not a prank?
right.
actually, this is our third show, but we're not gonna run until the fall.
to see if this is a prank, you're gonna have to play the game and earn the money.
you will be asked to perform a series of missions.
the missions will force your boundaries, your courage and your thinking.
that sounds fun, right?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where am i signing?
i didn't have a girlfriend to admit it when she was high.
i have to look after my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
come around.
you'll notice.
the total money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if you all get the night out, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can spend the night here.
anyone else want to join him?
not me.
there's no way i'm going all the way to the city with this piss boy from
i'm in.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you guys are idiots.
it's a fucking party joke, they're gonna fuck you all up.
you don't look like a bunch of idiots.
can't you see this is a recording party?
or get famous.
there's a human head there!
don't worry, it's not real.
it seemed pretty real to me.
that's why they call us special effects.
isn't it lovely?
a little sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thanks to our bounty special effects team.
follow me, fellas.
in the hot swampwater, lazy crocodiles are waiting for their prey.
the indian crocodiles become long and spotted faces.
such gators...
guys.
i see you're working hard as usual.
ready?
we're all set.
and totally.
keep it up.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great that you scared them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are joining the show.
you really looked like you were terrified.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, looking at this place really gives me the creeps.
did you know that?
the dead homeless?
sure.
why didn't you say anything?
that must be a big coincidence.
you really think it's safe there?
it's safe enough for the insurance on the show.
any more questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're recording.
each of you has been chosen by your own free will to spend the night in jail to gain $00,000.
it's obvious, isn't it?
okay, let's get this party started.
you can find anything you need at your base camp, that's the manager's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you took everything we had, so how can we write it?
go down the hall, turn right, right, right, then left.
straight up the stairs, left, right, and another left.
do you want me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
there you will find a key to get rid of your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought leaving the basement was awful.
have fun, inmates.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to duty.
can you not do that?
i can't see a damn thing here.
anyone remember where we were going?
go flat, right, then left.
no go straight, two right, then left.
there was so much going on.
no, go straight down the hall, down the hall,
"go back to the left, do it right again, and left.
"and then straight down the stairs,
"sola, right, and left again."
what are you?
smart.
illet, it's gonna be a great show.
careful.
careful.
jesus.
what is this place?
and be ready.
it was fun.
let's speed them up.
yes, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
the power's going down, the generator should have come in.
damn it!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's freezing here.
look, the key.
yeah.
okay.
look, people.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think so, director.
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what, man?
"hey, brave contestants.
"welcome to warden clem harvis' office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room.
"the chess pieces will determine your own personal role.
"you can't trade with the other contestants.
"the rails were her favourite."
"now it's your turn to put your hand in the box".
shit.
well, who wants first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black hawk.
black rook.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
fuck!
that was really crazy.
welcome to my little piggies, mission.
now let me tell you about the pennyville state prison.
in 0000, with the cost in 0000, the cruel warden decided to increase his fortune by destroying some of his expenses.
they were prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the warden's crimes were revealed.
the last person here to be executed on death penalty was principal harvis himself.
rumor has it the director was still walking through the halls.
you will be asked to face the principal tonight and the tortured souls under this building.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
does anyone want to change?
no!
okay.
"the white queen has to go to the prison church to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first hallway.
that sounds awesome.
thank you.
damn it!
what happened?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, take it easy, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung the babies!
kids...
i think they put it all on speakerphone.
the voices are more effective than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
jesus!
that sounds great.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
i heard something.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're making noise from the speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn your flashlight off.
okay now?
open the sign page from the bible...
"you will find the lord's prayer there.
"there has been disrespect for this place that was sacred 00 years ago,
"now this is the center of extraordinary events."
oh, "the opposite."
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do that.
"when you complete your mission...
"if there's no sign of the director,
"you can go back to camp."
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry about who i'm bothering.
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
" protect us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"do not let evil rule us.
"and do not overcome us...
"as we forgive those who owe us, forgive us our debts.
"give us our daily bread today.
"as in heaven...
"as in the sky,
"because rule and rule is yours."
please tell me i can go now.
"before i go camping,"
jesus, randall, you need to blow out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look at the money made.
where'd she go?
from what i understand, the people who did this job had cut off our connection to our homo friend for a more creepy weather.
whatever.
definitely, like, clogged.
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, dude, it's not that bad.
definitely not worth the money.
but fulfilling the mission was worth money.
thank god i'm done.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it again.
they can assign you back.
no kidding.
i swear you don't even know how people feel in there.
it's like walking through a busy fog, only as cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go to the next one.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated.
let's get scelzi down and have a look, you'll be ten.
scelzi.
yeah.
i need you to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
either we talk or i'll go or i'll talk or i
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i had a little research done.
and by "don't" you mean the town girls you sleep with?
am i right?
big lips, big hips, taylor.
okay, the prison isn't just for the men, is it?
there were any women in the department?
and the goddamn crazy manager would walk around the women's division naked and never answer to anyone.
beat them, rape them, get them pregnant, and starve to death.
some people say he's been feeding their own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this true story's gonna make the show more interesting!
anyone could be talking about us.
that story you made up is nothing compared to the truth.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do this, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
really?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they do.
good.
scelzi, what is that?
just a little something to get me through the night.
want some?
get your hairy ass here right now, okay?
aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the hell out of me.
i've got a great stuff here.
suit yourself.
we're totally ready to start.
i can tell you my biggest fear is being buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will bring you freedom here".
okay,
i'm at the end of freedom.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
fuck!
what?
blood.
not real blood.
no swears, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs are not down, but upstairs.
i'm sorry.
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down there, you're gonna see a finger door.
he says...
damn it!
welcome to cell number five.
"if we think of the violence and the madness and the violence,
shit.
tell me what to do... and i'll get out of this hell.
no!
thank you.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
she says, " if a prisoner can't commit suicide, if a prisoner can't,
"you will now live the punishment sent to a prisoner."
okay, where's the pit?
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult mission.
"what are you gonna do when you're in the hole."
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my job.
connie.
what?
look at this.
what?
no... no...
you're fired.
why?
you go behind my back and you hire something to add to the show, and you ask me why you were fired?
this is not our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you have to take that guy out, okay?
he's gonna ruin the show.
damn it!
we'll be ruined.
so you didn't bring this?
cut it out, no.
it's obvious.
what's open?
come closer.
i asked you why you were putting a camera in the control room.
yeah.
camera footage... they want to record...
wow!
wow!
you're right.
genius, right?
totally genius.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to record how you scare us by putting things into the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll go on with the show.
as planned.
three.
black and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you there'd be a mission again.
smartass.
okay, black king and white horse turn right and go to the gas chamber.
the white queen and the black horse keep up, and they go to the prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"the hawk and horse go left and then right.
"come and ride to the end of the hallway,
"and get down the stairs".
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, open it.
we're in.
"welcome to the gathering room.
there must be a light in the wall behind you, turn it on.
"black king and white horse go into the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
it deserved the best, it's a real place.
the only place the legal department has ever cleared.
isn't it beautiful?
pretty scary.
jesus.
what's that smell?
a documented fact of execution rooms often carry the smell of death itself.
of course, the smell is not death.
if a man knows his last moments of his life, his anxiety over the course is caused by an epidemic which gives him plenty of smell.
in this case, the smell of the human smell that we breathe now and the gas that killed him is the smell.
now for fun, ladies and gentlemen.
the black witness is sitting in the chair.
black person?
that would be me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you'll find some meat and a pan.
"you'll cook and eat this meat."
man!
the prisoners who have always eaten meat cow, pig...
"or whether it's not a lamb or a meat...
"they suspected it would happen.
"they thought it was a pleasant meat they never tasted before."
you mean human flesh, right?
are you in?
yeah.
guess what now?
i gave up.
you'll tie toni up.
i'm telling you, toni should fully experience the fear of the previous prisoners before the gas is given.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends have weird wishes.
are you okay?
okay.
"your job gas teammate...
"lead to find the main van and cut the gas."
you should watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 you'll throw up.
okay.
strange.
i can't do that.
i can't.
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
"no more silly jokes anymore."
remember what you said?
