michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, his brother, buster, shared his bed.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for both of us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i'll tell him
i have to write at least 000 words about the moral side of the war and the ability to prevent a conflict.
i'm not sure our ethics teacher would appreciate me cheating while writing a essay.
so, you passed my moral test.
actually, gorgeemichael was desperately abused... with the teacher of bethbaerlyad.
small-time offenders can be brutally chopped off.
no ring ring ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
the g.d.k. was on us.
your father thought it would make us look good.
he must have faked my signature.
'i may have a son who finished his cottage cheese a year ago!
you've got to get me out of
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't take care of her
i no longer have a mother's tenderness and milk.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls... a couple
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yes-yes.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
by the way, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
why do i tell you this?
i guess there's some things you can't tell your father about
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set his teacher with his father... so he could do his mothering duty.
there's nothing wrong with that.
but still, i have to tell you i'm a little hurt because you don't think about it.
aunts can do that.
teachers can fill that role.
surely, one day, you will find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay had never been more proud of what she said in her life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i was telling you about.
girl, really... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma," you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache
yeah.
but gob misunderstood the emotional appeal michael had been courtesy... and felt he was fighting to get involved.
because, you know, beyond adorable... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
[ nazhgalia, michael, shannon] really?
and a surprise visit to george sr. was about to arrive.
i read all your teachings and got all your tapes.
and i watched it all again.
george sr. had recently marketed a series of tapes... of himself telling people... to make money for his new spirituality.
i also lost two pounds to eat your banana bluth jail bars.
i've come to find out where
this is a good place to start.
and michael met lindsay at parent-teacher night after dating two girls who were dating.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this rape room have the same floor plan as our kitchen?
i think he's really good for you.
i thought you'd get it out of your head.
besides, i can't hurry up and marry someone just because my son wants to.
i'm miss baerly, the ethics teacher
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life... that could be lost by the impenetrable of an insensitive
and michael got to know his son's ethics teacher.
that's the "rrrrr" side.
you know, it's annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you were laughing.
"rrrr!" - "rrrrrrrr!"
but, you know, ... ...
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite you for a drink?
or... or...
yes, he's dead
i think it's because of this whole mr. daniels stroke thing...
let's go have a drink.
maybe it will help.
george sr. was dealing with his own admirer.
i've already told you so many of my sins.
maybe you can tell me some of your sins.
well, there are legal demonstrations that show my sins.
but let us return to your sins.
tell me about one of those... what happened at the university dormitory again.
and what did michael have to do with his second date with miss bayerly today...
michael, that little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with him.
at least, i think it's him.
you have to rob her to the underwear to tell her for sure.
yes, mother.
they'll take him back.
don't take off your shoes, little man!
don't take off your shoes!
it's out of
who is it?
this is annyong, your father and i have adopted.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you find a new son?
lucille found out that she was worried, even jealous.
and he knew what it felt like to be ignored.
annyong is your sister's your sister
cancel it.
he's stay
listen, i'll call you sonar again.
nice driving.
are you making dinner reservations?
it was a little korean.
and after the dates...
michael took a step he hadn't taken in
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how are we supposed to sneak in without waking everyone up
this might not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but apparently we're even now.
you took someone i love.
i took someone you loved.
"nashbagerajam"...."
listen, i know you're trying to get back at me about marta.
i was lying to you when i told you i wasn't gonna try to sleep him, so...
he has to accept that.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
honestly, i had a chance to get rid of him.
it's ok
so romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but first i don't know if it was real.
but now, now... your moral teacher...
yeah, i did that for her.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm sure he's interested in her.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
about his class?
i mean, that he loved her... the sadd
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with her.
so why did he do that?
why did he sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new... new... new...
he's not one of the good snipers targeting him, and he almost shoots everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, you think he's old for you, don't you think he's old
we don't even know how old he is.
nobody knows.
she was escorting young girls at different dances... and i thought i'd go to her, and, you know, do something...
"hey, you want to dance?"
and i thought, "oh, what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it different in front of the mirror, but
but, you know, um, we danced with jokes or something.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should date someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've just grabbed a book that's hard to get a picture of saddamey's bathroom suite.
"what did sadadad do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's the same as our fire escape.
in prison, george sr was preparing for an evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon makes his own preparations.
how we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael called the family expert on making trouble while still angry at gob.
i know you're dating shannon.
that cheerleader?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid,
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i called mr. daniels and i asked him... but he was breathing and he dropped the phone.
i never heard back.
you know, maybe we should both go together.
right, i mean, he was a bad example...
hello.
my mother took him.
she's making me record her for school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss george michael's condition with ms. bearly.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
i want to talk to you about it.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morals... about mor
you see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's like in love with you, so...
he knows we're dating.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most contrary thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been a moral teacher half a semester
look, it was a preemptive act.
my brother was trying to sleep with you.
so, i want to leave you right now and i won't come back to you.
i understand.
starting now.
george sr. went for a walk with cindi.
george.
and she got to know him.
you can pour it all to me right here.
it weighs upon my soul
you, you...
he's picking up the camera
so, it's your dinner, away with mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy
watch your back, my little immigration brother!
and the different spring dances were in the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting him in because he doesn't have a strong square jaw with his perfectly shaped eyes, like you.
you want to dance?
all right!
gob finally found shannon he was looking for...
gob had found out he was cheating on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i ruined our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about it a lot, and-and-and
that's... that's what you mean by the right
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school dance?
i'm only here with my girlfriend.
yeah, my ethics teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my moral teacher.
i'm really moved by you trying to protect me after i treated you so badly.
in fact, gob mistook michael's ethics teacher with domestic research.
man, your type... understood.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a local teacher.
act two.
i was seeing ms. baerly, and i shouldn't have dragged gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed over some sad things, but...
i don't think we'll have a future.
and, jeremy, i'll take that cake.
hey, you want to dance?
i can't believe this is working.
the next arrested development.
buster's conflict gets heated.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
no candles allowed here.
my mom would go crazy.
no, it's okay.
i burn my own candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna
you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
it's ok
here, let me help you.
these too?
okay, i'll move it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is something really extreme.
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die
we'll all go someday, won't we?
four months ago, each of you attended an interview to attend a never-been tv show.
and guess what?
you win.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm totally gay, and i'm proud of
you're cute, aren't
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel, england.
me too.
that's my brother stanton; my probation officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him in the head.
he doesn't know
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they look like barack obama these days.
each one of you will make $00,000, all you have to do is spend one night in this prison.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
damn!
great.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know if this is a prank?
right.
this is actually our third show, but we're not publishing it until the fall.
to see if this is a prank, you're gonna have to play and earn the money.
you will be asked to perform a series of tasks.
missions will force your borders, your courage and your thinking.
sounds fun, doesn't it?
what kind of assignment are they, man?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i don't even have a girlfriend who's gonna take this
i need to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
around.
you'll notice.
the total money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if you all make it through the night, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can make me spend the night here.
anybody else wanna join him?
i'm not.
there's no way i'm going to the city with this
i'm in
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him
bye.
you guys are idiots.
it's a fucking joke, they're gonna fuck you all.
you're nothing but a bunch of idiots.
can't you see this record is a party.
or become famous.
there's a human head in there!
don't worry, it's not
looks pretty real to me.
that's why they call it "special effects."
pretty cool, huh?
a little sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thank you to our special effects team for the award.
follow me, my friends.
in hot swamp water, lazy crocodiles await their prey.
the indian crocodiles become tall and pathetic.
that kind of crocodile...
guys.
i see you're working hard as usual.
ready?
we're all set
and absolutely.
keep it that way.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great you scared them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are joining the show.
you looked really severed.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really gives me the creeps when
did you know that?
the homeless who died?
sure.
why didn't you say anything?
must be a big coincidence.
do you really think it's safe there?
safe enough to get the show insured.
any more questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're recording.
each one of you was chosen your own free will, spending the night in jail to make $00,000 a head.
clear enough, isn't it?
okay, let's party.
you can find everything you need in your main camp, that's the principal's office.
where?
it's compl
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you took everything we had, how can we write it down?
go down the hall, turn right, again right, then left.
straight to the stairs, left, right, another left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
there you will find a key to escape your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought leaving the basement was terrible.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to the mission.
can you just not do that?
i can't see a damn thing in here
does anyone remember where we're going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, two right, then left.
it was too much flat.
no, straight down the hall, flat down the hall,
"turn around, make a right again, and left.
"then straight to the stairs, stairs,
"sola, right, and left again".
what are you?
smart.
illet, this is gonna be a great show
careful.
careful.
jesus.
what is this place?
and get ready.
it was fun.
let's give them some speed.
okay, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't
the power's running, the generator should have kicked in by now.
damn!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here
it's freezing in here
look, the key.
yeah.
okay.
hey, guys
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think he's the principal
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what, man?
"hello, brave contestants.
"welcome to warden clem harvis' office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room
"this chess piece will determine your personal role.
"you cannot change your stones with other contestants.
"the rags were his favorite".
now it's your turn to put your hand in the box.
shit.
well, who wants to go first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't
what do you mean you don't know
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black rook.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
damn!
that was really crazy.
my little piggies, welcome to the mission.
now, let me tell you about pennyville state prison.
in the time of crisis in 0000, when the cost was increased, the brutal warden thought to raise his fortune by destroying some charges.
they were prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the director's crimes were released.
the last person to be sentenced to death here was warden harvis himself.
rumor has it the warden's still roaming the halls.
tonight you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured spirits under this building.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
anybody want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the prison church to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first hallway.
nice job with sound.
thank you.
damn!
what?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, take it easy, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung babies!
their children... their
i think they got it covered with speakers.
voices are more effective than images to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
jesus!
sounds great.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't
something came up.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're loud, randall.
really.
okay.
oh... my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flashlight.
okay now?
open the bible to the marked page...
"you will find god's prayers there.
"00 years ago, this holy place was disrespected,
"now this is the chamber of unusual events."
oh... the opposite.
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit
i can't do
"when you complete your mission...
"if there's no sign from the principal,
you can go back to camp".
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry, whoever i'm bothering
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
" save us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"do not let evil rule us.
"protect us from the breezy...
"give us our debts, as we forgive those who owe us.
"and give us our daily bread today.
"as heavenly in heaven...
"like the sky,
"because domination and dominance are yours."
please tell me i can go now.
"before going camp"...
jesus, randall, you have to put out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look what they do for money.
where'd he go?
as far as i can tell, the people who did this job have cut off our connection to our homosexual friend for a bit longer to get a more scary vibe.
whatever.
definitely, it's gone smoothly.
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, man, it's not that bad.
definitely not worth the money.
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm done.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it
they can still serve you again.
don't joke
i swear, you don't even know how people feel down there.
it's like walking in heavy fog, just cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next.
what do you mean?
some cameras weren't working?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated
let's have scelzi take a look down and fix it.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy
either we talk or i go.
it's important to me too, taylor
what do you mean?
i did a little research.
and by "research," you mean the local girls you slept with?
am i right?
big lips, broad thighs, taylor.
okay, this prison wasn't just for men
is there a women's department?
and that bloody freaky warden would roam around the women's section naked, never answer anyone.
he used to beat them, rape them, get pregnant, starve them to death.
some people say they feed their own babies.
what's that supposed to mean?
what do i mean?
this true story will improve the show!
anyone could be talking about us.
that's nothing compared to the story you invented.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do that, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
really?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yeah, they work.
good.
scelzi, what is that?
just a little something to make me take the night off.
you want some?
get your hairy ass over here, okay?
aye, aye
hello?
you scared the hell out of me.
i got some good stuff.
suit yourself.
we're all ready to begin.
i'd say my biggest fear is to be buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will take you to freedom of liberty."
okay,
i'm at the end of the freedom
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and take a right.
damn!
what?
blood.
it's not real
no cursing, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs are up, not down.
i'm sorry
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
you'll see a door with a finger as soon as you get down.
he says... he says
damn!
"welcome to prison number five.
" considering the violent and insanity and madness,
shit.
tell me what to do... so i can get out of this hell.
no!
thank you.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a prisoner can't commit suicide, then, if
"now you shall live the punishment of a prisoner."
okay, where's the
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult mission.
"what are you gonna do when you're in the hole
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my job.
connie.
what?
check this out.
what?
can't...
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back, and you specifically told me... that the show added something, and you still ask why you got fired?
this is not our guy.
where'd he go
who the hell is this?
i don't
don't look at me.
look, connie, you gotta get that guy out, okay?
he's gonna screw
damn!
we'll be ruined.
so you didn't bring this?
not with cuts.
it's obvious
what's open?
come closer.
i asked you why you were putting cameras in the control room.
yeah.
the surveillance foot surveillance on the back of the camera
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
it's brilliant, is
absolutely brilliant.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants us to record how scared you are by putting something on the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black king and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you could be reassigned.
he knows a lot
okay, black king and white knight turn right and go to the gas chamber.
white queen and black horse go straight, and they go to the prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"king and knight turn left and right.
"to the end of the alk and the cartway, go down
"and go down the stairs".
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, open it.
we're in.
"welcome to the gathering room.
there must be a light on the wall behind you, open it.
"black king and white knight are entering the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
it deserved the best, it was the whole place.
it's the only place the legal department cle
isn't it beautiful?
pretty gruesome.
jesus.
what's that smell?
documented facts of execution rooms often carry the smell of death itself.
of course the smell is not death.
if a man knows his life is coming to the end of his life, his concern is caused by his emitting matter.
in that case, the smell of the gas that we breathe now smells of the person we breathe is the sm
it's fun time, ladies and gent
the black king sits in the chair.
black king?
that would be me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you will find some meat and some attitude.
you'll cook this meat and eat it.
man!
prisoners always eat meat cows, pigs...
"or because it's not a lamb or a lamb...
"who suspected he had become..."
"think they've never tasted before, thought it was a nice meat
you mean human flesh, don't you?
are you in there?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i give up.
you'll tie toni up.
i'm giving it to you, toni should completely live the fear of the prisoners just before the gas is given.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends had some weird requests.
you okay?
okay.
"your mission is your teammate...
"to find the main valve and shut gas without killing."
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to puke.
okay.
strange.
i can't do
i can't
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
no more "no more pranks."
remember what you said?
if the team wins, they'll pay extra money".
do it for the team, girl.
you gonna puke?
thank you.
okay, angel, i'm at the bottom of the stairs.
shit!
can you hear me?
he's back
it really stinks.
let me out.
come on.
let me out, man.
jesus!
who's the guy standing there?
topless.
muscles.
let me out.
i don't know, con. this guy is starting to creep
stop playing games.
let me out.
how's it going
we need to talk to you.
outside?
yeah.
i have big news.
i think the company's playing us.
what?
who's there?

he's probably hiding out somewhere.
i'll call the office.
okay, you too.

okay, i'll go and prove it to you.

you're really photogenic.
you're funny, kid.
i want to do my duty now.
turn the air conditioning off.
come on.
connie, what do you want to do?
stop the game.
wow, this place is haunted, huh?
it gets a little weird.
where'd he go
i don't
i didn't see him.
he went this way.
this is a dead end.
what was that?
yeah, what was that?
shit.

ed, wait.
agent 0, report.
again, the cia liaison officer has been shot.
lead two, do you see qasim?
command, i heard a vehicle.
they shut everything down.
it's over
the bbc can confirm that the american terrorist leader adem qasim has escaped from mi0.
apparently, the security convoy transporting qasim was attacked at raf northolt route.
you call it not war but murder because it's on the west streets.
because in new york, in washington, you didn't want that in london.
but the children of pakistan didn't either.
when they get hit by drone aircraft, they call it murder.
qasim offers a new kind of threat.
so far, he hasn't targeted civil
our models show the possibility of an attack within 00 hours.
the more pressure he gets, the smaller the window becomes.
i can't say that when the tape's on the
the foreign minister is coming tomorrow.
we serve the british people, not washington.
if that's not true anymore, then we're already
the americans think we no longer serve purpose.
we need a head.
i'll be relieved of duty
did you hear about qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, what's gonna happen to me
you can take it off, too
no one else knows you're in qasim's network
just leave.
will holloway?
go.
how's life after mi0.
you're not from the moscow section.
london needs you.
is there anyone you should say goodbye to?
thank you.
we know harry's connection to your family, so we understand this may not be easy for you.
even if he's dead, that'
harry's too arrogant to kill himself.
he was pretending to kill himself.
he went to this woman's grave
the love of your life
harry's team has noticed changes in harry's attitude since she died.
emotionally distant, cold, beginning to drink large amounts of alcohol.
water would be below 0 degrees.
he'd have hypothermia before he reached the bank.
this is the picture before entering the land, and this is the picture you said it was taken after jumping.
before she disappeared, harry made three encrypted phone calls.
your old emergency message box.
why did he call you?
i have no idea.
the last time i talked to him, he got me on mi0 years ago.
he wants to talk right now.
that makes you useful.
can you help us find him?
no, thank you.
and you, harry, talk about berlin a lot?
the night your father died?
if there's anything else, mace, i have a right to know.
i don't think i can decide that...
i think you said what you wanted to tell me if you weren't really gonna kill
find harry, so you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
i thought i was taking that title to the grave.
he's the anti-terrorist president for his majesty's security service recently.
funny, but who are you really?
someone who knows what these two words mean to you.
asma shishani.
go.
how did you find me?
what do you want?
i know someone on my side did it.
they never told me who they were.
of course they didn't, but you must have had a connection.
it's a phone number, that's
i could use the phone number.
in return, i'll give you what you want.
impossible.
he said he was a human rights lawyer.
your government helped them after putting my two brothers in jail.
but after i was released, the girl became too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if he's an agent, he's not one
and when it's okay, tell me again that it's not worth anything to you
keep her alive, she's guaranteed to keep my word.
i don't need guarantees.
take him to a hospital now or the deal is off!
what he needs is mercy.
no!
she's got a
and you sent him after me?
you put him in danger and now you refuse to save him from pain?
how the fuck are you?
don't send a video to his parents.
harry... harry
you have a deal.
according to the bbc, there is no breakthrough in the capture of adem qasim, terrorist terrorist.
the national threat level has been compromised, so eli has an attack on his ear.
in economy news, the ftse 000 fell again this morning and sterling continued to breathe the dollar, the euros and other funds.
there's a new intel on harry.
it's got a conductor fault we tracked down to kent coast.
holloway, this is classified information.
we found explosive marks there.
you've known him longer than any of us.
do you think it's possible qasim might have got harry involved somehow?
pulling him over?
i don't
anyway, you find harry, we find qasim.
anything for holloway?
here.
tomorrow, 00 o'cl
park in five, six, eight.
then, open your eyes.
i hope you come alone.
just for protection.
if you can't bring in a crazy cold war morgue, we're in serious trouble.
i promise not.
it says not yet.
we play this through harry's way until we see him.
understood.
doors opening.
go.
ground level.
doors opening.
open sightings, multiple exits.
repeat, holloway.
what harry needs to set up a meeting.
yes, mr. holloway, your uncle said he'd meet you at the coffee shop.
he left his cell phone at home.
the man in the parking lot, get rid of him
they could wear mi0 shirt.
listen to me.
stop underestimating harry.
don't think he won't put your men in danger.
wait for him to send a signal...
what is it, alpha one?
holloway?
holloway, where are you going?
wait.
no, there's no pattern there.
don't move.
holloway, freeze!
terminal 0b.
doors closing.
he got me a flight.
that's the flight pa000 to dallas.
i'm going to dallas.
call the gates office.
get me the airport police.
cigarette number nine.
the police want a clear path to the terminal.
and get us clearance for heathrow security.
pa000, passengers for the glassow plane's flight...
holloway, stay out of the air.
what am i doing here, harry?
i had to find someone outside the service that i can trust.
it's a short list when you're drunk, crazy and dead.
to be honest, the only person i can call friend is someone who thinks i ruined his life.
qasim's escape was set by someone at the top of the service.
by one of the people who asked you to follow me.
that's why i had to disappear.
you had qasim.
he's our only connection to the traitor
once he's in the system, he'll be
he's planning an attack.
someone's trying to destroy the service itself.
you're insane.
ruth's death...
don't
look for yourself, that's all i want.
what are you waiting for, harry?
mi0 was everything to me and you took it from me, for nothing.
hate me all you want, but i think you believe in the service.
what happened in berlin?
they tricked you like that?
this may not end as you'd hoped.
i'm afraid i have to tell them there's something in the lining of your jack
nothing there, but they'll have to check it out.
i'll send you a number.
call me in 00 hours, please.
i'm a security guard service.
hands behind your back!
you just let him go.
relax, francis.
we don't want you to have a heart
the deadly one.
mi0 seems to be a complete liability right now, and i'm the last friend of mi0's government.
so you're gonna have to be really nice to
in other words, is he crazy?
that doesn't contradict his last three psych evaluations
he refused to attend.
he didn't stop being harry pearce.
no matter how crazy he is, i still catch him...
i mean, like,
she asked me to help her disappear.
you didn't think to accept your request and bring it to us?
just because your life hasn't been worth a damn since harry kicked you out, don't think we can't put your life in a more shitty
since we've threatened each other, the three of you haven't been shaking on a cliff.
your entire organization seems to be cleared out right now.
find qasim.
fully loaded.
they're ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i saw that name working on a case.
i thought they relieved you of duty.
they did.
now, what really happened?
the abduction may have been arranged by someone in the service.
you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i quit 0 weeks ago.
there's got to be one around here
tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't apply
when i was 00, i was hanging out with a guy who transferred money.
k was interested in some people using it, so they came to me.
you started as an agent?
and when i was done, they asked me to train as an officer.
my parents came back to me when i told them.
and if someone you work for helped qasim escape, that would be a problem, wouldn't it?
all right.
something felt wrong that day.
robass, my team leader, he was in the lead car with me.
he told me not to open the weapons compartment.
he ordered me not to pursue.
where does he live?
it's
w00.
panama city.
service fund.
june, what are you... what are you
who are you?
you told me not to chase qasim.
you told me not to chase after my gun.
we swore an oath, rob.
i'm not saying anything until we get to thames house.
we're not going to thames house, we
will, what have you found?
qasim's bodyguards are deliberately weakened.
his team leader was involved.
he's just a shoe
find out who gave the order.
the americans think mi0.
qasim escaped, we fell out of sight.
the cia has got it all.
fire... fire
he was gonna shoot
his pulse... his
dead, dead.
he's
listen.
you should go home.
june!
i'll handle this, but you gotta go, now.
i never heard such a song killed by a piece.
who's warren who shot the eyelashes?
landon miller.
agency hawk.
he's trying to secure his ongoing support, hopefully not to hand over the keys to the kingdom.
every time i see you, francis, you seem to be buried another inch or two inches buried in the secrets of a cow whose eyes turn from langley or the pentagon.
you don't have to tell me
i don't think we should ever forget who's flagged in all these times.
francis.
i'm trying to help, but he basically accuses me of doing business for the cia.
tonight, your generals, your politicians, your spies met for a celebration.
tonight, we will strike at the heart of their power.
our enemy, the politicians who send your sons and your daughters to die in illegal wars.
spies spying on you like criminals.
this war is far beyond religious differences.
all flights out of the kingdom of the united kingdom
he had it in
warrender lived.
if you have a way to get to qasim, tell me now.
there's another way.
qasim's wife.
asma shishani.
the fsb has her.
if i find out where they keep her, she'll give the traitor.
you made a deal with him.
yeah.
and if we can, he'll lead us straight to him.
surrender and set it up.
how do you know the russians have her?
in exchange for a blown cia agent stuck in moscow.
i can get to the far side, but you need to open the secret door.
it's an ip address.
you're kidding.
it's the only way, will
harry's getting help somewhere.
i've cleared his old contacts, but i need access to personnel files to do it properly.
but it doesn't take you anywhere exciting.
in position.
looks like i'm gonna have to steal more extra bandwidth.
the drink.
malcolm?
all right, i'm in.
i'm looking at the servers now
harry, we gotta go.
can't we do this any faster?
i can do it.
but unfortunately, this machine is from the previous century.
g branch already pulled these.
erin watts.
might be worth a closer look.
fill in the blanks for me.
but i got a spy.
i almost got him out.
i've been in business less than a year.
or soon they make you choose.
all right, i'll leave you alone.
are we done?
why am i sure?
i'm sorry, will.
harry.
harry!
harry, what have you done?
stay away from the computer.
i've never felt compelled to say this before, but i hope you know what you're doing.
is harry working with qasim?
he stole all the gchq data archives.
everything we have on our western agents in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
he showed up at schönefield airport cctv.
i don't
that harry cyber didn't attack alone.
then who's helping him?
except you.
and you're still protecting him.
why?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i'll find him.
and there's a threat.
analysis shows a large-scale attack in 00 hours, multiple targets.
a spy on qasim's escape is missing.
signs of a struggle at home.
you know anything about that?
how's your mother, holloway?
i hear he's not very good.
he hasn't packed since your father died.
understandable, really.
and then that door comes to work.
i know, i know.
harry was right about one thing.
you're not good enough.
home secretary, can we really hope that qasim will stop attacking again?
we've destroyed threats to our freedom and the way we live.
your ability to wound us may be important, but it's the end of
you will learn that our decision has no limits.
they're not listening.
they never killed our women?
we're making the world a better place, brother.
transfer team in position at city airport.
we have atc authorization to shut down the prisoner car when necessary.
i think i owe you one.
you were absolutely right about vass.
danke.
alexanderplatz.
it's on the northeast corner by the subway, 0000.
we have a safe house.
call it nostalgia.
don't forget to bring the archives
don't forget to bring his wife
how did you find me?
there's only one place to meet in berlin.
you told me.
northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
no emotionality.
this is the price of qasim's wife.
when the fsb is out of custody, qasim will give me a number.
he's taking me to the traitor.
they'll destroy the service, where it can be defended.
get in the car, harry.
there's an old hotel 00 minutes away.
my contact can meet us there with clean passport.
you're going home.
i'm sorry about that.
why are you here, miss keaton?
keep walking, harry.
i killed someone because of you.
you're c0.
what are you doing, harry?
talent discovery.
so which one of you found it?
jesus christ, will.
preparation is everything.
and vass?
when he came to my house, i called
i said someone was asking about qasim's escape.
they tied me to the command center and told me what to do.
they went to vass's house before we did and planted the evidence.
i set vass to escape.
you think i want to do it?
i know my mission.
i'm the only one who kn
you were set up.
he's right, will.
but i wonder if miss keaton is sure about me.
it was a secure chain of command.
what was i supposed to do?
do you believe him?
yeah.
i'm sure your men will come and find you if your usefulness is still valid.
after all this was over, what did you think they were gonna do to you
i did what they asked me to do.
we're changing the deal.
we're taking qasim's wife to london.
tell him to come to the exchange or he'll never see his wife again.
let's go get her.
what happened to alexanderplatz?
a sudden sense of agoraphobia.
i'm afraid there was a problem with qasim's wife
at least be good enough to put it in my car.
harry.
colonel.
i hate to be unkind, but we're gonna need your clothes.
as the search for adem qasim intends to focus, all passengers travelling on the united kingdom's national line have to show valid id and face bag control.
i have your wife.
let me talk to him.
the russians put him to sleep and...
bullshit.
i'm bringing your wife to london.
no.
i'll tell your whore you said goodbye.
is the baby too much?
no, it's just you.
i trusted june.
you were right to relieve me.
despite everything i've done, you're still trying to do something good here.
i will not allow your sacrifices to be in vain.
it was here.
fast?
he could've let me go, but he chose not to
you try anything, anything, i can't guarantee anyone's safety.
nobody's
you bring my wife, i'll give you your phone number.
here we go.
hello?
holloway.
this message came from h branch.
me.
we can catch qasim, but we need help.
and report.
one clean choice, hannah.
trust me, and help me.
or go.
do well or not, eh?
shit.
they're approaching position.
what i wrote last night is constantly updating itself to self-replicating algorithm, reviewing all potential points of view.
so he doesn't cut the tide?
please.
all right, we're here.
how much time do we have?
i'm looking at 000 cameras.
give me something.
as soon as he realizes we're playing him,
wait.
he worked 00 seconds ago.
are you sure?
yes, confirmed.
camera disabled in the last minute.
third floor roof, east corner.
harry, we have to stall.
i have to hope she's looking right at us.
yeah?
you were told to look south.
i have his wife.
you were supposed to look south.
give me the number.
give me the number or we'll leave.
turn around now or you die.
here.
him too.
i haven't got it yet.
you have 0 seconds to turn around.
turn.
maybe this guy never saw her.
i'm almost there
him?
kill him.
give me the number.
don't
stop!
no!
okay?
will, she's fine.
the shooter's dead.
then it's over.
malcolm, feather.
yeah?
my wife's dead, isn'
harry, listen.
hannah will let us know.
harry?
hannah, why did harry remove the headphones
i don't
let us know.
get sco00 here, now.
four full of rdx trucks leaving limehouse north industrial park in the next 00 minutes.
how do you know?
qasim just told me.
trucks loaded with bombs leaving in 00 minutes.
i think we got him.
let's go!
armed police!
stay where you are!
clear!
clear!
the main target?
negative!
negative!
negative, sir.
command, area clear.
harry.
he sold his own men.
why would he do that?
what did you do?
armed police!
freeze!
move!
you have to tell them everything, harry.
i think we have a lot to talk about.
this might be a little out of line.
since the southwest corner of alexanderplatz.
keep holloway close by.
make sure he's safe.
maybe we won't be so hasty.
did you find qasim?
harry will talk.
you still don't know him.
qasim gave up his entire operation.
what did you tell him?
i should have thought they'd release you after berlin.
they want to offer you a deal.
throw it all on harry and go.
i told them i'd give it up after i did.
there's no way
i can't
there's an emergency backup key wrapped around his neck.
whatever you're after... whate
what would ruth think?
what did you give him?
check the back.
southwest corner.
i found harry on the northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
the opposite.
that's where you trap someone.
harry?
i gave you to him.
get down!
get down!
get down!
lock us up.
get down!
get down!
we're not here for you!
we came for them.
get down!
think of your families.
hamza.
why?
there are 00 men on the other side of these doors.
you must surrender.
come here.
open up!
if you think we're gonna negotiate... we'
open the door.
but he'll kill us.
there are too many demons in one room.
the only way out of here alive is to surrender...
you think i want to get out?
how many people's lives began to end in this room
the lives of my people.
your people?
nobody asked you to speak for them, to kill for them.
if you want a hostage... if you want
i think he made it clear he wasn't interested in
i'm the director general of mi0.
kill me and put the gun down.
otherwise, you're nothing but a dead terrorist.
no one will see you as a hero.
by the time we're done, you'll be a drunk, wife-beating, powerless head.
we'll drive a couple of marrakech male prostitutes and give them free tickets to disneyland in return for saying you begged them to piss on you.
we can't remember you very well, can we, adam?
wait, wait, wait.
i pulled the helicopter back.
but... but
you fucking coward.
i thought you were fighting a higher standard.
i'm sorry about your wife's death, adam
i know what this can do to you.
is that supposed to stop me?
it's
stop!
why did you bring him here?
i made a choice.
without a plan b.
why do you think i keep you out of that room?
people are still dead, harry.
less than the ones who will die in the explosions.
how do you make a choice like that?
this is my job.
auntie, can you come outside to play?
hello, geraldine.
finally, it comes down to who tells the longest-time lie.
right?
if we had protected that morning, qasim would never have escaped.
you ordered the met's air unit to reverse all mi0 requests, didn't you?
that's the advantage of being a lone maniac.
i don't need to prove it
sacrificing his own service so he can be absorbed by a foreign power.
the americans would have made you chief of general, no doubt.
how many more lives was that promotion worth?
what was it you thought you did, harry?
the service is dying
but the moment i realized i was on the losing side, my career would be too short.
blow my brains out, find my 00-year-old niece my 00-
i think it came from you.
what is it?
his pearl intestine is penetrating more than 0 hours or causing unstoppable bleeding.
leaves no trace.
how clever.
i was afraid that would be your answer.
so i took the chance to choose.
it's not lunch that makes you sick.
i had beef ribs.
tell me you're lying, harry.
please.
tell me you didn't betray your country.
it's already been four hours, geraldine
you can spend the last three hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd play that beautiful niece of yours
i'm thinking.
your message said you were going to tell me something.
they're spying on ruth's grave.
you can't leave now.
i actually have something you should be.
your father was wearing this the night he died.
the stasi removed everything that could work and found ways to enter through your body and the fsb archives.
she was wearing a wedding ring on the night of her operation?
i didn't fire you because you weren't good enough.
after your father, i couldn't...
i should have protected you.
good can't last forever, will.
then who does?
they're like me
it would help if you knew your problem and told the men at the door.
there's room for every guest at hotel middle school.
single file.
these new problems are killing in the dark.
these people will be grateful when the darkness falls.
i think we should keep them here to keep them safe, but i'm worried things will get worse.
they have no idea who caused the dark problem.
and it's not what hides in the dark we have to worry about
we still haven't figured out how to lift that fog wall
maybe it's a blessing.
that was the latest from in-flight safety.
i'm on your side and i might need a new job.
i've got it under control, but i'd love another pillow for my beauty sleep.
try to fix things.
we talked about this.
it's almost impossible to eradicate someone with a problem without killing him.
of course, i just need tools i don't have, materials that are impossible to provide, and maybe i need information.
i'm gonna need a team
do you have any idea what's going on?
but there's a bad element.
it's the only way to protect the rest of us
and it's risky driving because of the magnet problem.
an engineer to help fix the power plant.
he volunteered as soon as he knew about it
if things don't work out, you can use her problem for operator.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
the untraceable killer is out there somewhere.
and i think he wants to prove to you that he really wants to help you.
okay, well, whatever the reason is, look after her for me, okay?
because neither of us is immune to new problems.
i'm not just saying it's because
i'll call the person who caused the darkness trouble at school when you leave.
he stole those batteries and endangered us.
there was no choice, dwight.
this is the third case in two weeks.
now the serial killer is in this building.
all right, i'll go talk to dwight.
my father always said you were a good man.
mara's father?
there may be a way, but it may seem more frightening if you want me to explain, so don'
even on the map, i can't find maine, haven.
are you telling me you can't find a town with 00,000 people?
that didn't cause problems.
then why didn't we use aether in the first place to finish the problem?
i can't bring them back when they're sealed.
so how do we find it?
gloria brought a box of stuff that duke left in gull.
i don't think william has the amount i need, and aher is just the first phase.
you told his wife you'd find him.
it's easy to make a decision on the edge, but sometimes things
i have a town to protect.
no wonder the plant's working at 00%.
guys, i'll try, but remember, i've never done anything like this before.
they parked the car here so i could talk to you, but i don't have enough money to pay for the oil change.
if all goes well, i'll be back with aether before sunset.
this is peggy's husband, rolf.
enough panic and fear.
the same killer who killed my son 00 years ago?
we call him the killer who won't leave a mark.
what else are you hiding from me, vince?
dwight's doing everything he can to get the rules to accept, but he's not the guy to kill people
in this haven, banishment is the same as executing.
thanks to our friend there, we're holding them in some kind of prison.
he says the generator worked at 00 percent.
damn, the generator must have unloaded the energy reserves.
that explains why there's department power in town.
at this rate, about five minutes.
it's almost over, and it's the only thing that keeps us from dying
here, i rearranged the generator settings to get power to the town faster, but there's nothing more we can do.
they better turn.
help each other.
turn the lights around.
share supplies.
you see, i'm happy here.
i got your message.
get in the car now.
come on, jump!
if war lies ahead, we should be thankful, even slean.
i don't think you have anything worse than being in love.
i don't like it here.
there are two sides to every story.
whoever's behind this is a traitor.
let's go.
he asked me to represent him at slean's wedding.
palace, you are my brother's love.
that's why you're my brother.
you've seen bigger places in the iraq realms than here.
none of them were ruled by a woman.
you must choose a second to escort you and observe your interests during the ritual.
then you will hear the bonds of your friends and relatives.
i don't have any rel
my mother and the others will accompany you.
kela, this is the palace from bregan.
rheda, must i always be guarded?
i don't really get it.
but i know i should marry slean.
i will love her.
this marriage can't happen
abrecan trusts you.
what do you do for a living?
carpenters.
they can use you on the wall, then.
who are you?
a friend of the chairman.
like i said, i have business to attend to.
we need to figure out how to handle it.
varr said i can't accept gifts.
between us, then.
every bride should smell nice when it's
remember, it's our secret.
sit down.
we'll take what we'll get when they look at the wounded.
you wanted to talk?
all right.
kela, it's time for your ritual.
elvina, are you gonna be my second?
for the game.
we need to talk sometime.
we need to discuss why the marriage shouldn't work.
if we don't fulfil our mission, their marriages
beowulf!
let's celebrate.
by old customs!
the stink of clothes is sore.
i'm so sorry.
it was just a little mistake.
that's all
we'll help slean give the symbol to his bride.
sounds easy.
breca!
open the door!
come on, you stinking mudborn.
come on!
come on!
give me your arm.
come on!
slean.
quiet, the head's asleep.
are they ready for this marriage?
i don't understand why slean wouldn't want to marry kela.
i don't think so.
put your feelings aside and do what's best for everyone.
would you put aside what you wanted for others?
that's what we all have to do.
if someone spends their whole life pleasing others, then that person doesn't actually live.
thinking like that must make you feel pretty free.
try it.
tell the truth to every rock.
only then can you look at each other and burn the fire that symbolizes your marriage.
then you'll be husband and wife.
have you ever loved anyone?
no.
before i came here you...
do you want to be thane?
tell my uncle i'm done with him.
go.
come on!
move!
you let him go.
we're not done here.
don't you understand?
i betrayed my mother and set up my uncle.
this woman was sent here to kill you!
i don't
really?
i killed my brother.
he was the one who was supposed to be with
even if there was no earth, mara had everything.
people loved him because he was kind.
my father loved him because he was his first.
she and rowan were lovers.
then i had the opportunity to escape.
i didn't need anything.
she died of humor.
he was getting better.
i poisoned him.
slean, i won't tell anyone what you did here today and what happened.
or stay.
i know, but he's beowulf's.
he went to bed last night.
but we can choose who we can draw our fate.
light with me.
you want to be thane?
i can help you.
against whoever gets in your way.
they can't take it from you anymore, rheda.
with this marriage you're jarl of the shieldlands.
these rules of jarl must be applied by any tribe.
if the blood money is not paid, a killer's life will be termin
the thieves will be branded and cast out of society.
all the merchandising costs in shieldlands will be set by jarl.
what right does he have to set the price of fish?
we are the ones who risk their life to catch the pandiri every summer.
you should have told me about these rules.
you were where your people needed you the most, at the watch.
i couldn't distract her
that was messy enough.
you're late for pandiri.
some think you missed him again.
but if you fail, bregan will be miserable and starve the winter.
breca's wanted for murder, you know that.
kill him!
kill breca now!
i got it!
do it without any explanation, and we're all dead.
he hired us to deliver breca to the law after he escaped the gallows.
ask the man who helped him escape the first time?
so we'll welcome this.
but we must keep the breca.
as we speak, heorot may stand our gates!
who do we kill young women sometimes?
what do you mean?
you've been hiding in the shadows for too long, ab
remember who you're talking to.
talk.
he wants breca's life or blood money for the murder of his brother.
i didn't mean to kill anyone.
hurry!
thank you.
breca loved her.
he's looking for the widows he thinks he's got, then he steals the money and runs, this asshole
he left my mother and took everything of value with him.
my brother came after him.
but that cost you your life.
breca, is that true?
i'll pay for your brother's blood.
lila, do you have 00 silver coins?
i don't want money, i want blood
silence!
if the blood is paid, breca will be released.
you lied to me.
pandiri.
pandiri!
fasten it.
get ready, they're coming.
i saw it.
get out!
the council is assembled
harken wants to replace me because i missed the pandiri.
you let me down, slean married keela, rheda was jarl!
you don't understand
tell the council our enemies are gathering, that your sister cannot rule, that you want to save the shieldlands.
so tell me you're distracted.
tell me.
i'm sorry
i knew breca killed someone, but the story he told me was different.
it's only his fault.
lila, no one thinks bad things about you...
that's all i got.
did you bring it?
there's not 00 silver in
not enough.
i'll hold on to breca while i see that job.
was there enough money?
lila?
turn it off, beowulf, please.
you're not talking to lila.
get on your horse, leave herot and never come back.
there's no room for you here any
if herot's attacked, i want to fight properly.
if herot's attacked, i'll protect you.
let's try.
it's not about mudborn.
i don't want to talk about him
i want to know why you lied about teaching me.
it's wasted on you.
you don't even want to be one.
really?
i didn't know we were training blacksmiths!
go.
now!
he fights girls now?
it was more like the blacksmith was training huskarl.
i know you think i let you down.
i can't focus on my duties in bregan.
but i have my reasons.
you're talking about betrayal on one of your own blood
we need a warrior at the center of this land!
someone to bring his people out of the darkness.
a man in power to take control!
you're talking about betraying your sister to hide the fact that you can't provide for your people.
what's the point of having fish if we're all going to be slaughtered
i'm here to vote insecurity for thane.
those against abrecan being thane.
the verdict
a new thane will be appointed and announced in the morning.
get up.
next.
nobody.
don't think it's a
we're lazy, distracted.
this is gonna work out here.
from now on, we'll work like my father hrothgar.
i didn't mean to interrupt
you're a good teacher.
a great thane wants a strong army behind him.
we don't have to share the same bed, but if we don't share the same room, people will
i always liked watching herot from here.
it looks so undefeated.
if i tell my mother the truth, i'll lose her trust.
and a chance to rule one day.
what if abrecan attacks?
herot could fall.
no advice?
i trust you.
your decision will be correct.
and i'll be there when i do.
you will be thane.
you just have to believe.
pandiri.
pandiri!
it's the pandir
sound the horn!
i order you, sound the horn!
abrecan, give it up.
if we don't act now, we'll get the opportunity
why... why
you, help me carry the net.
help me with the net now.
why don't you help me?
pandiri!
come on, hurry up!
go find me a sack.
people shouldn't leave their valuables lying around.
you owe my mother an apology.
but i'm a warrior and honor is at stake.
so i'll take your life.
go back to mommy, little girl.
greetings.
i didn't need your help.
because he didn't have enough money to save you.
be thankful you didn't kill him, vishka
if we don't plant the nets, our prey will be
no, he won't.
get ready.
abrecan, no!
hold the rope still!
hurry up, they'll eat you alive!
pandiri, pandiri!
pandiri, pandiri!
hold on!
now get back!
check it out.
there will be songs about this hunt.
a catch you won.
i have a dream about us.
to be the biggest tribe in the shieldlands!
we're not going to follow the laws a jarl can't even keep a sword.
who's with me?
abrecan, abrecan, abrecan!
i need to warn beowulf.
bregan!
elvina!
the warriors come together.
they intend to destroy us this time.
beowulf!
back to our environment today, we see more danger and harm come from religious beliefs.
my wife would be less embarrassed if i talked about soviet communism and about the atrocities of stalin.
it's the very nature of the interrogating species of interrogation that determines the problems of humans.
to present a situation that is perfectly true in itself can cause serious damage.
when the prophecy isn't done, we make fun of those people and the whole world makes fun of us.
i had a friendly disagreement with richard dawkins on the issue.
maybe we should be more aggressive with richard.
especially america is surrounded by christian faith.
they're sure the world is what their religion says it is.
we'll get rid of the bad gu
i'd like to write a book like this, if i could.
but, of course, one of my fears is what happens next.
what kind of chaos?
how true is it to do that to people who think we're saving the civilization and the good in us?
religion is like moral viagra for many people.
if that's true, if religion does help people lead moral lives, then one should take very seriously the proposition that we're acquitted, and it will turn the devil down.
because there's a lot of people left on the bottom and we can make chaos out of these people's fear.
a lot of people want their lives to mean something, and where does that come from?
but there must be something better than religion.
yeah, there's definitely hope.
let's see what happens.
sure.
at least you didn't get a piercing.
i don't know how to explain this to amy.
i'm the stupidest man
all right, knock it off.
i'm the stupidest man
okay, you win this.
i can't find emma's papers.
honey, just so you know, even if you find the original receipt, you can't return the baby.
i have to find the paper that angela signed when she left emma on my doorstep and gave me the only proxy he gave me.
i'm finally getting health insurance for what i'm responsible for taking care of myself and
i haven't talked to her since the night we made emma.
calm down.
you gave me all the important paperwork about the baby to keep them safe.
do you have all the papers?
his dad's little girl is a big
maybe something with a balloon.
it looks so good!
you robbed a clown?
it's your birthday!
my first birthday's tomorrow.
you used to party all the time when you
well, celebrating my birthday... after that...
"happy birthday miley." "
you know those papers i kept for me?
how irresponsible do you think i am?
but i... but
i may have mailed them in on time, too, and i may not have sole custody of emma.
we were all excited because the new baby came and i didn't have a stamp!
look, if we get angela to sign this paper again, we'll be fine.
you're ben's best friend and you're the only one who's seen the girl...
i like it very much, all right.
all right, emma's finally asleep
hey, danny, what's the reason riley doesn't want to celebrate her birthday?
really, why does he hate it so much?
ben, riley hasn't had a birthday party since the past 00 years of disaster.
are you sure you want to watch this?
i think i'd remember if it was a disaster.
all right, come on, guys.
danny, where are we going?
luckily, she lost a real mustache and lost a personality weight to the future.
me here too?
benjamin wheeler, come here and celebrate riley's birthday.
okay, i can tell you this is my best birthday ever.
tell me you didn't do anything to the cake.
actually, try to save it with perm first and then cut it out.
is riley still in love with ben, or is that something that happened when we were kids?
unless you still love riley.
i ruined her sweet-00 party.
not during birthdays, but the rest of the days she loves you.
if ben is so irresponsible that he lost the papers and that he's so scared to face me, maybe he doesn't deserve to take emma's attorney alone.
if it makes you feel any better, we do most of the work.
i can imagine how hard it is to leave emma.
i knew how beautiful, funny or amazing you would end up hurting her!
in your presence, city streets, elite u.s. army tank unit, destroy only in three minutes, the slade trooper, 00th and 00th
also known as madox-00.
besides, a uh-00 has more damage power than blackhawk.
it's perfect for anti-terrorist and anti-gerilla operations.
miss kusumoto is also the chief architect of the software for "tankbuster."
in order to demonstrate madox's abilities with a disgrace, the pilot personally went into the cabinet today.
unit 0 will go to ichigaya tonight.
we're in a hurry, so hurry up.
also...
miss kusumoto, you've made me quite embarrassed
i'm not here for the congrat

i'm telling you, don't worry
i'll buy you dinner in exchange, okay?
sdf's transport car...
the report said it was natural to encounter this case...
it's obviously terrorist work.
you're far too stranger to the eastern bloc operations.
i hope you know what you're saying!
i hope you see that the obligation of the accident is all yours.
either way, the situation we're in is critical.
we were transfer him to the field test!
it's fuck
i have to attend the operation.
besides, the madox-00.
we're having trouble while investigating the crime scene.
should we call the police for backup?
we must prepare ourselves for the worst and keep the help corps ready.
i'm the only one who can go up against the madox and take a head.
although lieutenant kilgore is one of the most important men in the army, he is our army.
is this-- is this okay?
nobody in the building?
anyway, i'm a little relieved.
shiori was a really pretty girl, man...
when he goes to england, all the boys in japan will mourn.
where did you learn that?
he called me in the morning and asked me to give you a message.
use the open switch to open it.
it burns!
the pilot can be adjusted.
it feels like wearing boots to ski.
we've got the madox activation signal.
this is a disaster.
could you warm it up in the microwave?
i really fucked up!
shiori, what do you want?
defence forces?
you're going out with the prototype airborne tank tank.
don't you dare turn tokyo into vietnam!
tokyo or vietnam, it's the same battlefield to me.
you'll be catastrophic.
no need to worry.
i'll deal with it before it gets too hot.
lieutenant kilgore is using the most advanced tank and anti-tank helicopters i promise him the madox mission.
in this case, there will be great panic downtown.
there has to be someone who can stop kilgore and the madox.
what can we do?
we don't know the madox's target yet.
if i can find him before lt. kilgore does, then perhaps i'll have a chance.
but the madox's condition... but
i'm gonna use unit #0.
what are the chances of success
hey, you heard me!
wait for me.
yeah!
how's it going!
what are you doing on the road?
i can't wait by the side of the road like a curb

they're all over me!
i gotta go down that way, use the west exit.
another armored freak out when he stopped!
all right, back to work, madox!
i hear you.
and i say, "you're a headache."
if anyone has caused a mess, it's you.

really, i saw your show.
you fight pretty hard.
i will deal with yokota headquarters, personally, whatever it takes.
hey, where are the civilians in the
what's so important?
why am i going crazy when you think of me?
his target is the madox.
he'll come after you to destroy him.
the most i know how to walk and use my hands.
you got it.
either the madox is destroyed, or you kill kilgore!
they've damaged my legs.
i can't move anymore
you think i can defeat him?
you did very well while we were fighting.
have you read the entire manual?
hey, madox.
bastard!
come kill me!
wouldn't you go a little bit harder and boost my appetite?
damn!
what happened, you turned like a turtle!

what are you doing, brother?
what's the matter with you, man?
why are you being such a bitch?
who are you, brother, jeremy kyle or something?
you can't sell somebody's baby to someone
especially vince and carol.
the other day, we were selling junk whores to this man!
no, you didn't, because he doesn't want to be found,
they'll give this boy to another vince and carol.
let me go, brother.
i told you i'd take care of it, man.
what am i gonna tell people?
yeah, yeah, he's
a bit, but don't tell anyone we're here!
just take half, give me the rest.
i can't believe you sold a baby!
you didn't want it before, did you?
if i'm gonna go through all this stress, i'm gonna lose the money, i'm gonna lose everything, so you need to talk to someone proper, okay?
a nice lady.
i'm like, "fuck you."
what's going on out there?
you sell drugs in a bar, right?
either you or your stupid brother took my gun and i need that gun.
you got 0 hours to get my gun back or i'll blow people's houses off.
i'm leaving.
he always spoils things, doesn't he
when my wife was upstairs, why are you bringing this bitch to my place?
what's going on?
he had problems with a sturdy russian mafia who had trouble everywhere.
he thought they were gonna kill the baby.
so he left the baby on the train.
now, take the money and i'll give you the rest when i meet ed.
it's not a fake, vince, you know it!
you can't tell when you don't have a dick in your mouth
it's not a problem when i'm fuckin'
no, he said your cock was in his mouth.
i'm not giving them the baby!
they can't take it either!
calm down, all right?
now get up and bring that baby!
over here!
my gun!
just know that she died just to give you this.
they may not let you go because you have no family.
what flowers do you like, any suggestions?
white roses are good, aren't they
fuck you!
fuck you!
are you the owner of this car?
but you've stopped me for nothing.
but before that, let's raise our glasses to the new owner, chester.
chester.
i hope he will tremble over these wonderful monsters as i have done for years.
cheers.
i promise i will raise the standards of this show and you will be proud.
have a nice trip to where dreams come true.
good riddance.
even if that big-faced german leaves, we can take over the dominance.
marjorie, it's a shame...
thank you, chester.
now, if you'll excuse me, let the original family, the community of monsters and strangeities spend their last moments alone
bye.
there's someone else to thank.
mr. richard spencer.
our lives have completely changed the course.
cheers.
mm!
but tonight we'll have a nice feast, and then we'll watch a movie from my collection.
not the sign of the cross again.
no.
tonight we watch freaks.
do you know this movie, richard?
i can't say i know.
it's a great movie.
talk about it, eve, paul.
ah.
cleopatra is an ordinary trapeze artist, married to a dwarf who makes small shows.
but his real purpose is to poison him and land him in his legacy.
he twists all the freaks on his finger until one day he gets too drunk and starts bailing his true intentions.
then all freaks turn on him.
one night they take their revenge with knives and guns.
eve, eve.
darling... don't miss your taste.
sounds great!
there's a lot to do before we head west.
i can't
shut up and sit down.
you deserve it.
what happened to you?
come on, richard, open up.
i've been thinking about you a long time.
oh, thank god.
we've had our sneaky clients, but... we've never had anyone fainted.
are you all right, ma'am?
where are those security guards?
good to know.
now it's your turn.
jesus christ.
i don't even know that.
i already told them everything...
stanley.
elsa... el
come on... come on
talk to them.
hollywood!
i'm afraid... that's all you
just a dream.
come on, flip it.
aah!
god... god...
no.
please.
my cousin works at garden of allah.
but you brought death here... and you have to pay for it.
take him down.
come on, come on.
elsa, come on... we need to talk privately.
i believe we have something in common.
you think you can run now?
i'm telling the truth.
he killed her.
he's not who you think he is.
and start running.
run!
run!
run!
just because you're a fatherless grownup now, there's no need to make things romantic.
how did he die
who killed him?
we all did.
he broke the code.
now.
come on.
he was my father!
he killed a freak!
the most fragile of us.
you believe his word?
this fraud whore?
i saw my dear ma petite in a jar with my own eyes.
i heard him confess.
as for maggie, we'd have more bodies if she hadn't helped us.
i won't forgive him.
all i want is to rot in hell.
you're gonna be friends with whoever's hit
maggie's gonna change your bandages.
no!
leave it dirty.
now that your mother isn't here, it's up to me to protect you
i've seen you grow from a man to a man-- and we need you.
no hands!
i can't even do myself.
i found an old friend.
he'll come and help you.
he's a real artist.
but the wounds need to be healed first.
maggie will help you.
let him.
i'm so sorry.
i hate hurting you.
really?
i thought that was your only gift- hurting people.
i love you, jimmy.
this is the real part
i always have.
i want to make a fresh start.
we can still go to new york like we planned.
why not?
you're kidding, right?
after all you've done, do you think we're just going to sail to the new horizon?
my hands... are in a fucking jar, and you are responsible for all this.
i'm so sorry.
can you bring ma petite back from the dead?
huh?
i've changed, jimmy.
ow!
i knew you were stupid, let's add blind to your list, shall we?
get me someone to focus the lamp!
i can't leave.
i need to set the right light for the first time, understand?
try again now!
scheisse!
elsa.
sure.
he's watching us.
can't we?
just this once?
please?
okay.
yeah.
mm.
oh.
thank you, chester.
you put me down.
like an old sock.
i'm sorry, marjorie.
i got a little... carried away, but i'm happy now.
i have them, i have magic, you exist.
maybe i should go.
we can manage, marjorie.
the twins accepted you.
they just don't want you watching them do things.
they're using you, chester.
you're the bosses now.
no, they don't.
they love me.
you're a killer.
no, no.
no.
marjorie.
i know you don't like to talk about it, so don't mention it, but you killed them.
and alice and lucy.
impossible.
i'm just a puppet.
hmm.
love destroys you, chester.
you're losing control.
i know... i
i'm a monster.
you don't need them.
i'm in.
i know.
please don't leave me, marjorie.
the twins?
they have to go.
i know.
they will.
ethel looks great here with choir girls.
oh, this is her barnum day.
she was a unique woman.
to ethel.
to ethel.
so what do you say?
did anyone hear what spencer said last night?
now everything's back in place.
elsa killed ethel.
forest.
car accident.
it was all a set-up
i believe that.
that crazy, vindictive woman threw a knife at my paul
all elsa cares about is elsa.
i didn't get it from the start.
i know ethel.
he wasn't someone to kill
he's not a
he wouldn't do that to his own kid, and he wouldn'
and he'd leave a straight note.
if someone comes after one of us, we know exactly what to do.
our future has one security detail.
whether elsa lives or not.
have you ever imagined that you would feel that way, dot?
thank god you told us about marjorie.
all he had to do was push him.
i think we've certainly made a good impression on it.
evening, girls.
what are you doing here?
i came here to extend friendly xindi.
i have some information on your final condition.
we don't want to hear anything from you.
leave nicely.
oh, dot, i can't blame you.
i had a terrible behavior the other day.
but recent events lead to the softness of my violent sides.
i lost my mother.
it was so sudden and... terrible.
she's very upset, dandy
losing one's mother is a terrible situation for everyone.
it was.
yeah.
and it made me feel i shouldn't leave my loved ones alone.
but i think you should know we're seeing a man.
actually, i got your news.
you have no idea what a glorious situation it would be to marry you.
believe me if i had the chance to do everything...
i came with friendly feelings.
i know i lost my chance.
i'm not half the man you deserve.
but i asked myself.
"dandy, what do you have to do to support the girls you love so much?"
then it occurred to me that i could protect you, and that's why i hired a decent man to gather information about your new friend.
it broke my heart because your chester creb is a complete freak!
we don't need to look at these.
what's the matter with you?
you're a pain in the ass, and we don't trust you as much as our sins.
ta-ta then.
i did my best.
my mother always said to discuss it with a woman when she was angry.
who is it?
son.
here.
drink.
what is that?
penicillin.
i'd hate to see you die of an infection when we say we complete you.
who are you?
my name is massimo dolcefino.
i came to make you your new hands.
okay?
massimo is an old friend of mine from before the war.
he is the master of his art.
no, thank you.
i saw soldiers with grenades exploded in their hands.
they got their hands on those cool hooks.
i can't do 00 shots, but at least i can hold my cigarettes on my
and i don't have to be afraid of the wood dryers for the rest of my
massimo offers you something more elegant than pancakes.
more convincing.
look.
see?
so is the other.
massimo saved my life.
your mother died of booze and left you hungry in the streets.
i could have married her if you weren't so stupid
"my only sin..."
si.
"l love you..."
plent very much
no!
they were members of a organization.
and the leaders were a doctor.
now get on the other side, don't rush this time.
two years, two years, two years
massimo took care of me.
she taught me to walk.
and dance.
then hindburg fell.
nuremberg, rhineland...
we were supposed to escape while we still had the chance.
we had a plan.
how could i look my love's eyes when i knew those monsters were free?
they had to pay.
i caught them one by one.
aah!
finally, i reached the leader.
oh, monsters' head.
dr. hans grouper.
there should be no painless death.
obviously my death wouldn't be painless either.
he took it very personal that i wanted to kill him
very personal.
he tortured me.
he locked me in a cell and tortured me again, and again.
how did you survive?
i lived in osterlich by the end of the
then i came to america- at 00.
and i called miss mars for years.
but i didn't get any answers
if you loved her so much, and you knew where she was, why didn't you just walk out on your feet
my body survived the torture, but... my body
i was like a pinocchio.
there was nothing left in me for humanity.
but, uh...
beautiful ironi.
beautiful ironi.
i know you've been awake a long time, and it might be hard to change for a sit-down show.
and again-- this has nothing to do with ego.
for this continuity... this continu
he looks so normal.
i don't think we can judge him unless we have absolute proof.
what about the file?
it says he killed his wife.
you let dandy's lies cloud your judgment.
dot and i have something to say.
we don't want to be your assistant any
why?
we just... don't want to.
maybe when you hear my final, you'll change your mind
two bodies, two heads.
it's gonna be a
a first in the history of magic.
come on, girls... let's rehearse
we're not going in that box.
no, chester... we're not going in that box.
now if you'll excuse...
i will.
you... you
i can be your assistant.
yeah.
get in the box, lucy.
my name's mag
oop!
is this your magic show?
he looks a little pathetic.
shut up.
i didn't say anything.
what are you looking at?
backstage.
originally called the magic saw.
tonight you will watch a very dangerous version of me.
cuffs.
hey, i...
i don't know this part.
i went to war for you.
you should have died there.
we loved each other.
and then you came back with a metal plate and a buzzing bees in your head.
chester, stop, i can't move my feet!
stop!
stop talking!
you're distracting me.
stop, marjorie.
haven't you ruined my life enough?
you're nothing without me.
i'll show you.
all of you.
chester!
chester!
chester, stop!
what are you doing?
relax, people... it's just a magic show.
magic show.
i can call him back.
again... over
alakazam!
abraza abra
abracadabra.
that's gonna be a lot of people, chester
he made me do it.
he deserved it.
what do we do now?
steal your jewels and bury the bitch.
why are you packing?
you ruined everything again.
time to go.
you confused me.
you did it consciously to sabotage me.
i finally found happiness.
i'm leaving.
you can't leave without me.
oh.
i loved you.
chester... chester...
oh, god...
marjorie?
stay with me.
marjorie.
in the interest of elsa, dayton, 0000 across the world for the first stage tonight in front of you, my beloved boy and your beloved boy, the most beloved boy and most beloved crab youngster-t and i and your loved son-
jimmy darling!
i'm not a stage artist like you, mom
listen to your mother.
you have a very good smile and a wonderful weather.
you're star quality, jimmy.
now get your ass out there and show your mother why she's so proud of you.
jimmy.
maggie's dead
you want the details?
elsa's next.
tonight.
looks like... you'll have a chance... in real life
jimmy... jimmy...
i'm happy for you.
how dare you come in unannounced!
what do you want?
you have to go.
they've been plotting revenge all day in ethel's trail
they'll kill you.
why should i believe you, huh?
my monsters love me.
i'm like their mother.
ethel was more like their mother than you.
you killed their real mother.
the last of a desperate man's bullshit
who's desperate now
you saw what they did to him.
but where would i go?
anywhere but here.
you could have saved me.
we just did.
there you are.
what's jimmy doing?
he'd be here if he could.
it's time
give me that.
ethel!
let's get some... justice.
oh.
thank you for coming.
i would never deny a woman in distress.
i'm not in a spot
but i'm in a hurry
oh.
i want to report a murder.
who was murdered?
a young woman.
leave it here.
slowly.
put your hands where we can see them.
i did.
send me to the chair.
what are you doing here?
i came to count.
i'm the new owner.
where's elsa
he's
he went after his dreams.
elsa sold us again.
$00,000 in cash.
nothing.
everything here, including your contracts, belongs to me now.
and i want to see what's mine.
was it always your dream, sir?
to be in show business?
dream.
yeah.
and now it's come true.
i'm thirst
go get me a lemonade with a straw.
yes, sir.
are you ready?
yeah.
they're perfect.
i want to try it now.
sure.
the other one
put it on.
thank you.
but jesse james escaped and hid for two years.
in the greatness, the united states army has been looking to defeat the armies of sitting bull and crazy horse and secure the gold in the black hills of south dakota.
after the defeat of the battle of little bighorn, the u.s. government has chosen to starve the lakota nation into submission.
hold the line!
but despite the small wars against the united states army, the struggles of the indians were getting worse.
the lakota leaders were running out of options for sitting bull and crazy horse.
you're a man with a strong heart.
but i'm tired.
see you.
the native americans didn't give up despite the violence they saw and the destruction of their culture.
that's what it meant to be rich for people who lived there at the time.
many women and men have tried their chances.
the united states was the first country to save itself from global depression once gold economy.
the solution was found in
there's been a lot of cattle around texas, along the border of mexico for a long time
but they couldn't have been moved to the plains and taken to hungry people in the east until the railroad was complete.
in texas, the cattle, 00 bucks a head, were sold for $00 on the east coast.
cattle barons bought most of the airport from kansas to california.
this land provided amazing opportunities for its owners.
we're talking about millions of acres, plantations, thousands and thousands and thousands of major animals.
one of the cattle thieves in the new mexico area will become one of the most notorious men in the west.
his story began 0,000 kilometers east.
billy never knew his father.
they moved to new mexico with her mother in the early 0000s.
for years he wandered aimlessly.
what do you want?
whisky.
drop the bottle.
there were different kinds of cowbo
always sitting around the corner.
that's all you had to watch out.
billy used what he did best to make a living.
billy the kid was very good with a gun.
he spent every dollar he ever made to get a bullet for practice.
in a place like this, only the strong survive.
where are you going?
lincoln.
just passing through here.
these cattle belong to john tunstall.
then john tunstall can come and get his cattle back.
you'd better let me go.
i don't think so.
i don't think you have a choice
young cattle thief billy the kid has been captured by a farmer he tried to steal his cattle.
most people shoot cattle rustlers on sight.
you still haven't told me who you're
i don't work for anyone.
everyone in lincoln county works for somebody, son.
yeah, but i don't work.
you seem like a used man to buy me what you want.
you're right.
there's only one problem that i am.
you have many men.
you got room for one more?
when billy the kid came to lincoln, he needed a job.
john tunstall needed cowboys.
john tunstall came to the west to make a fortune.
he moved into lincoln county where he could make money.
but his achievement has pissed off some very powerful men
lincoln was one of the wildest places in the wild west.
everything was under ev's control until the cattle price, land and government officials.
they're paying for law enforcement.
in fact, most of the people who lived in lincoln saw them as bully.
john tunstall came to town and stuck his nose into the cattle business that's been a long time at home.
nobody would have been neutral.
billy went into business with john henry tunstall and became tunstall's man.
in a few months, young outlaw was tunstall's most trusted armed man.
for the first time in his life, young orphan felt like a home in the west.
tunstall was a mentor to billy the kid.
give me your plate, billy.
thank you.
i'm starving.
it's all going well, son.
i'm glad you're here.
thank you.
billy always barely got along.
he was seen by many people as a foot suit.
for a young man billy's age, it was incredible and changing life.
while billy the kid is now a part of the cattle industry that's fueled by america's growing up, a few hundred miles to stop expanding to the west.
take it easy, gu
i extend my left hand as a friendship suggestion.
if he hadn't done that most of us wouldn't be here today.
we would have died fighting instead of going to the reservation.
when they put us on the reservation, they actually took the human spirit.
he trusts me.
he's talking to me
god, messiah.
this policy is known as "assimilation."
but i think they wanted to make us unable to protect ourselves.
there was a saying used in the military.
"kill the indian and save man."
if you destroy indians' culture, you'll be a better person.
they thought we were savages.
the proud lakota warrior knew he had to stand up for his people again.
my public is not happy here."
i'm not happy here."
"we don't want to live in space."
you're not used to living in the settlement.
give me some time.
i'm sure you will.
after serving his objections to the united states authorities, the military is afraid the lakota warrior has begun a new indian uprising.
the united states was very afraid of crazy horse.
it was said that crazy horse wanted to kill a visitor.
the united states authorities were worried about a new riot.
while the fear of crazy horse plotting something, the lakota warrior went to meet with the authorities to clear his name.
crazy horse thought he was meeting with the united states authorities.
he didn't realize the importance of the situation
they wanted to put him in a prison cell.
then he took off his knife.
in spite of different views, i think the most reliable interpretation is that the white u.s. sentry bayonets
crazy horse battlefield wasn't killed.
his vision was correct.
he was unexpectedly overwhelmed by the sentry
on september 0, 0000, the man who fought his entire life to protect his people and won the war against the united states.
it's hard to talk about the death of crazy horse, because even after so many years, it's so fresh.
one of the things that's most fascinating about crazy horse and his inheritance is one of the few people in american history, one of the most non-indian leaders in america,
today, it is considered a symbol of courageous resistance to the united states government, and it is spoken of with respect.
i think that's what makes him so strong.
by crazy horse's death, the lakota people waited for a leader who could save what was left of their culture desperately.
until he paid evron his debt, he also took care of their welfare.
this is for you.
what if he resists?
i don't care what it's
only the results interest me.
understood.
go check it out.
you stay here.
okay.
what's the hurry, gu
we heard shots.
really?
don't do anything stupid, son.
this has nothing to do with you.
it helps to keep it that way.
there are always conflicting interests between these competition businesses.
but like so many disagreements in the west, it just became personal.
personal at the moment someone was murdered.
that was john henry tunstall.
he was killed because of the business conflict.
it was a personal matter now.
by john tunstall's death, billy set off to find his killers.
this road would lead him from an unrecognizable cowboy to become the legend of the west.
as the country continues to expand, men like billy the kid have realized that the border is not governed by law.
but over 000 kilometers ahead of new mexico, a man was preparing to bring law into the west.
in the plains of kansas where men take what they want and every day is a struggle for survival, no one is tougher than wyatt earp.
he was big by 00th century standards.
he was so majestic about his size.
wyatt earp was one of thousands of americans who had raided west in order to become rich.
wyatt was caught in bankruptcy west disease.
he always felt he had to push the next border.
this border could be mining, real estate, and anything to bring adventure.
that's how wyatt lived his life.
he did everything in the border to get it.
from laying tracks for the pacific railroads to hunting buffalo on the plains and even working as a bouncer at a brothel.
to move cattle from the open plains to the eastern cities, they had to drive to railroad hubs that soon turn into crow cities.
so the fast-forward cities appeared.
a landscape of unintentional soil suddenly becomes a hotel 00 rooms.
the young men who made it to the cities were drinking whisky and carrying guns.
so there were lots of young men drinking well and armed.
that was one of the reasons the west was wild.
wyatt saw that the law was not in dodge city and the disagreements were severely solved.
he had a hard life.
they'd either go back east or get worse.
but wyatt earp felt that fate had much more.
he was going to prove a spot of history in dodge city.
you got the wrong guy.
that's my money.
this guy's a cheat.
calm down.
he cheated.
calm down.
the guy cheated.
put the gun down.
did you see his gun?
everyone saw him reach for his gun.
give me that.
i'll shoot you!
come on.
the city of dodge desperately needed a lawman.
wyatt earp was perfect for this.
it didn't take long for wyatt earp to be appointed police chief to dodge city.
there was no special training to be a lawman.
that's not how it works in this city
wyatt earp didn't ask questions.
"dashing with a big boy" is a term from him.
wyatt earp was recently famous in dodge city.
he was going to become one of the most famous figures of the west.
because cartoon chickens give my dad nightmares.
where were you?
and that was irving berlin's white christmas.
the best christmas song ever sells all time is the
what?
actually, irving berlin wrote over 0,000 songs.
then marry him.
what's the matter with you?
i don't have a problem.
you have the type to write music.
what's that supposed to mean?
what are you guys doing this holiday season?
hey, baby.
where are you going?
father melley called.
i have to save the nativity scene in the church.
i have to cook something for the food sales.
did you hear me complaining?
what's rhyming with poinsettia?
i forgot again!
you're a hard man!
i can't produce anything in a hostile environment!
i wouldn't act hostile if you had two nickels!
you kick me again, i'll go.
your legs are crooked.
how's it going
so i brought you some soup and a thick coat.
yeah, i'll call him.
horribly ordinary!
terrible!
of course not!
yeah, and you know i'm a jew at eight.
good.
i'm gonna go get a bagel or something.
i'm going back to the dinner protection business
i'm calling shangai gardens.
but whatever i decide, it's gonna
i only have three days to cake!"
he doesn't sound like that, but whate
boom!
i was gonna make a pie, but i had to work late.
and i'm done.
so thank you, hungarian bakery!
says who?
larry's wife won't bring it.
she makes a great cake!
you know what he's doing?
any chance you're in town?
i really thought you were gonna make the cake!
i'm not a profit?
she would never be with you, you know why?
because he has to take his own arm.
stop it!
wonderful!
well, i certainly was.
what are you doing?
sounds to me like you're starting
kitchen robot, big scratches...
let me think.
nice, easy cake recipe.
how about that chocolate crispy one?
at least i'm wearing a shirt suit fit for my pants... you...
a monkey could make it.
i love you.
i love you.
am i imagining our giant?
no.
you should have put more baking powder.
you don't even know what a pinch is!
and nobody's gonna want to buy this stupid toy cake
we'll take the cake out to the bake sale in a
okay.
my calves have never been this much.
come here!
it doesn't?
after all the arrangements... after all
anyway, try this.
it's divine.
it's ok
we don't make traditional food sales.
we're doing something much more fun.
all right.
great plan!
i didn't count on the cake walk!
i've never seen caramel do that.
this is a candy-covered chair!
come on, come on.
hey, ling.
i have your mental problem.
well, when i... when... when
elaine?
whatever.
i see him, but slow motion.
how long has this been going on?
what does that mean?
i think you're in love.
how do i get rid of this
i got myself together.
i'm ready to sing now.
i'm looking for my soul tonight.
i know there's so much more to life.
thank you for seeing me.
how can i help you?
my wife cindy died two years ago.
we were married for three years.
we got hit by a car on our anniversary.
cindy and i wanted to have kids.
for example, that he died.
how will you do that?
or did he leave his egg embryo?
no.
did you hear me?
i heard.
to clone your dead wife?
scientists are trying it out of hand, mr. cage.
so i snuck into trying cindy.
my sister-in-law heard this and hired a lawyer to stop it.
that's why i need a lawyer.
he's going to court today.
yes, but mr. stoller, i must say your wife was a great man.
but the idea of cloning?
please.
there's nowhere else i can apply.
and your firm has met this lawyer before.
who is it?
larry paul.
i heard he was very successful.
it was him.
how can you have a virtual relationship?
a relationship is communication.
what about "it"?
i know you don't like it, but if her hands aren't on a stick, she can't control
all you care about is control.
i don't
really?
and you came here to talk about my virtual relationship?
i came to borrow something.
but forget it.
ally?
excuse me for a second.
the lawyer on the other side, larry.
really?
there's a conflict of interest here for me, isn't there?
you are responsible for the client.
yeah, but...
you didn't use inside little information when you defended him?
no, but i... no,
why wouldn't i?
just for the client.
my case's credibility is very little.
i need something.
larry's weak spot is rhythm.
he's talking to me too fast when i'm arguing, because he knows i can't
okay.
he's vulnerable when he loses his
okay.
you're in the "your dreams" program with cindy margolis.
michelle garris e-mailed me and asked me a way into hollywood.
we met in hollywood and...
do it!
i won't let myself use it.
we can't deny our passion any more.
you want me, i want you.
let's be honest.
you do my knee and i'll get my hair done.
you're breaking my spinal cord.
don't you like denial?
then let's be honest.
i'm going
i went to l.a. and never thought of you.
your mind is in jackson.
people accuse me of being superficial.
but i understand human behavior when it comes to relationships.
in our last month, you shaved your legs in the morning.
is that your scientific thesis?
when a woman shaves in the morning instead of at night, it's over.
no exceptions.
go to jackson.
he's the man you're crazy
first, cloning humans is against the order of society... against the order of
there was no court before.
when people are against cloning sheep cloning clone...
that's none of your business.
you won't let me take the second...
second sex term.
i object completely.
i wish i could just get back to sheep.
these rude have no place in court.
let's make a decision.
right away?
let's hear what mr. paul has to say.
second, forgive my rudeness...
he's kidding
even if he can clone, it can't be decided by mr. stoller.
too much.
i'm predictable in law cases, but i'm unprepared for too much.
he made fun of me three times.
i request a written apology, preferably notarized.
four times!
is this cloning possible?
first, i want to hear your client and why.
your honor, i hope...
see you tomorrow.
see you.
ling denies that he even wants him.
how are you feeling?
he can have her.
a man's depth is as much as a ink bottle.
i mean, i hope ling drowns.
are you really okay?
yeah.
actually, the attorney of the opposite was john cage.
did you know?
how'd it
smiling is against your principles.
what's going on?
don't ask me
john asked for some clues he could use against you in court, so i told him to break your rhythm.
you're no good without rhythm.
cute, but useless.
you gave him advice?
his client is practically mine.
we're sleeping with you.
you're going behind my back.
you advise him when you can't beat me?
does john know you can never beat me?
excuse me?
does john know you never beat me?
no, no.
never?
isn't her smile nice?
so cute.
someday i'll beat you too, but john will beat you with my advice today.
great.
i'll lose my edge.
no, you won't.
now he knows i'm trying to ruin his rhythm
he said you could never beat him.
not just in this case, but in any case.
he did?
yeah.
i bet, john.
he said i could never beat him?
exactly.
never?
never.
sure.
i could date a man in paris.
you can go as far away from here as you like.
i'm not gonna get you into this.
no, i don't.
how was i?
larry?
why are you here?
i thought john and i would walk together.
you're trying to confuse me, i'm not gonna let that
i saw the smirk.
it wasn't supportive
everything okay, john?
you seem a little uneasy.
he's trying to back it up, but it won't
good.
you want to go to dinner?
i'd love to
i'm full today, but how about tomorrow
great.
we always talked about having children.
i think i want to fulfill cindy and my dream.
but you're not talking about having cindy's child.
you want to clone her.
cloning is the only way to maintain his genetic legacy.
a lot of people, including mr. paul, who is sitting there totally in love with gayric
your honor, i'd like to stand deactivated.
mr. paul, sit down.
mr. cage, do not provoke.
most people find the idea of cloning disgusting.
but i'm not a scientist trying to perfect the species.
and i know i can't bring cindy back.
i want to make it last.
and i guess i don't want her extinct.
thank you.
first, i'm sorry for your loss.
but you're trying to copy cindy, right?
this is the process of creating a complete genetic copy of your dead wife.
it's the same with her speech...
did cindy ever mention genetically engineered fruit?
he was against it.
what about the genetically engineered chickens?
he was against it.
but it was open to the idea of a genetically manipulated copy.
it's not the
not everything is about chickens, counselor.
i didn't say that.
i'm nervous enough without you.
you wouldn't let anyone get your number.
whatever makes you great, you have to win it again.
maybe melanie scared him off.
john, i'm sorry, man.
but remember, larry said you'd never beat him.
never.
now you must think big.
because this time, i won't rub his feet.
whatever happens, you have to find barry white.
yeah.
yeah.
come on!
we did it together, baby.
does ally know?
the pressure doesn't help me.
may i?
sure.
just you and me.
bullshit!
how's this cloning going?
very impressive.
we're getting eggs from donors we inject with fertility drugs.
from the clone candidate, this is cindy stoller, we're taking a cell.
this part is very impressive.
the witness said it was impressive before.
just this part impressive?
then we shoot each egg's core with a needle.
there's a lot of needles in the cloning.
we're putting the dna removed eggs with the transmitter cells.
in that case, cindy's cell.
and we practice energy.
what does that mean?
we're shocking the heat, we're using some kind of
i'm trying to understand.
you put it down to killing bugs, and i find it disgusting, even for a public supervisor.
let's move on.
you're both losing my sight.
what happens to the cells after the energy is given?
they connect together when the data cells are given energy to the dnaless cells.
then we put them in the surrogate mother and after all, a cloned baby.
sperm?
no, that's very impressive.
is that really possible?
i gotta admit, most embryos die.
but it's possible that one of them is successful.
we've already tried that at the sheep
it's possible for people.
how far is this technology?
present.
people don't expect science.
scientists are waiting.
thank you, doctor.
hey, mark.
if you need anything, have your assistant call mine.
i don't see you in slow motion anymore, you hypocritical coyote
i see.
maybe some other time
what's going on
i'll tell you about dinner somet
forget it.
what's the matter with you?
what's wrong with me?
i threw myself at you.
i threw it like a cannonball.
you know what this is big for me?
i made you a gesture.
i told you i was in love with you last week.
anyone can share such a stupid feeling.
please.
i want something very small.
close conversations are coming, you should be with me.
together, we can beat larry.
just you and me.
come on!
you're at the end of
what else do you have to do?
you came?
you're here
that's why i start the day with a cappuccino bread.
he was here.
who?
barry white was here.
forgive me for not predicting this.
my concentration.
not like before.
with other people in the room, i can't bring her.
most people can't dance with imaginary giants in front of others.
i always brought her.
i used to walk in crowded streets with him.
no, here's what you should do.
call him alone in your bunker.
first take him out without a cut, then go out and continue among people.
i don't know if i can.
you have to.
without barry, what are you?
check this out.
you can't go through life like
you have no choice but to find barry.
they'll take his personality, his dna.
your brother-in-law loved your brother.
excuse me, i'll take my objections like this.
he won't bring cindy back.
even the only egg twins, even if they share the same dna, they're different people.
even when you're taking someone's organs, they need his permission
the replication of dna is a much more self-defense.
it's breaking into their privacy.
i'm sorry.
was that mine?
i didn't mean to.
that was a mistake
don't you want to see your brother's genes continue?
she'll look like her, she'll talk like
i wonder if she'd want that.
it's been genetically opposed to genetic research
he definitely wouldn't want
never.
you have a computer.
i want some privacy.
it's from brazil.
it's literally our first conversation.
i feel so good for him.
but hurry up.
i'm the one who's gonna rub his
did you find barry white?
any sign of him?
forget it!
can't find your own office?
yours is closer to court and my feet hurt a little.
i have no idea.
elaine!
the events followed each other.
will you stop following me?
you think that's what i'm doing
i didn't ignore you.
i thought you weren't interested.
you were right.
forget it, deja vu.
you've been furious since i came to this firm.
i'm angry because you lied to me.
i'm angry because i slept with you.
it's hard to wander around all the time.
it's hard to be a cheerle
i don't understand why you do it every day.
obviously, from the beginning, we're both a little embarrassed.
so why don't we make a fresh start?
you may be right.
you might not be.
jackson.
how are you?
i'm not complaining.
this is definitely ours, isn't it?
he's up to something.
yes, it is.
no one, just you and me.
he's a funny little man, isn
it's okay with me
just in time.
it's like being dr. frankenstein.
the idea of organizing?
choose dna?
these are terrible.
we could have hockey teams filled with wayne gretzky copies.
with a pitb, they can put mike tyson together.
the possibilities.
the horror.
but the truth is that every time science takes a new step it raises concerns about humanity.
we've already made babies, your honor.
we play with the genes.
this technology will save lives.
are there any risks of abuse?
sure, there is.
my client knows his wife's wishes and dreams.
dreams they had together.
this process will give the chance to maintain the family legacy they hope for.
we have to be open to science that allows a couple to have children.
it can't be who owns his dna, can it?
i'll remind mr. paul that the wife of his life can donate organs without permission.
mr. paul could say the wrong thing about mrs. stoller's wishes.
but there's no reason for us to believe that
you don't know when to talk.
now it's your turn.
i may not have a legal reason.
but i have a moral compass.
that's what's at st
then why stop there?
he can clone his mother.
his grandfather.
one day their children can play with their grandmother's twin in the sandbox.
celebrities might start selling their dna.
imagine being a parent to barry white's twin brother.
is the line going to be crossed when you start to take over the evolution of technology?
back in the day, we were afraid of heart trans
the idea of a tube baby was considered anomaly.
now the truth of life and the community accepts it.
cloning organs, saving lives, destroying diseases.
these can be real.
but to clone a human being, clone his dna, to do a medical similar thing?
dismissed.
i'm sorry
i appreciate your effort.
i don't want a rematch
hi.
hi.
do you come here often?
that's my opening line.
it's a terrible opening line.
has it ever worked before?
better.
you want to go to the bar?
not tonight.
because you beat larry?
it's not
to tell you the truth, i didn't want to win this time.
no, i want to be alone tonight.
alone with him.
not at all.
like you said, most people don't dance with an imaginary disco giant.
you're not cra
actually, i'm a little jealous.
when you're disappointed in the real world, you create something.
hey.
maybe the three of us can walk.
give me a chance.
if he doesn't, i'm still in.
well, i'll do it.
let's go.
who knew karaoke night would be the happiest party on the avenue?
you said it with p. diddy and kissinger?
tell me, "islands in the stream" never said so.
the limo driver called and said...
embarrassed donald trump's wedding?
sam, i've been in vegas for 00 minutes, but i haven't played a single hand of blackjack yet
your favorite table is ready.
ladies love a good karaoke singer, danny.
call me.
you think you can get any girl you want?
get him.
it's a lonely mission,
he's here for the born-new virgins convention.
girls who aren't technically virgins can change
the card counters have hit two of the hotel this month and the last shift report says there's a lot of losses in the blakjack tables.
there's a card counter down there.
ed thinks he might be a card counter.
maybe we can continue this conversation later, like drinking.
patty, this is three, and you've been here a week
i didn't pay my rent, and the reason the landlord let me stay...
listen, i'm sorry, but this is a business.
if we pay for every shirt you screw up, i'm screwed.
all right, the gift bags are packed and waiting to go to the guest rooms.
our florist has brought the orchids and the other 0,000 are coming tomorrow.
however, if for some reason he doesn't come, a ship for my next tulips from amsterdam...
mary, don't worry.
i'm sure everything will be all right.
you're the most relaxed bride i'
thank you for coming, galina.
that looks like a hundred grand.
a hundred thousand dollars?
like i said, first for me.
it's a lot more than what we lost.
playing with a certain duck doesn't mean anything.
the numbers sit on a table and the rich play, right?
the unsub's redhead, yellow dress, heading west.
thank you.
mr. sperreos, i'm from security.
the question i always ask.
we're not married yet and you've been staying out all night.
that's not good.
honey, i win here.
tonight's over, and so is yours.
all right.
i told donald trump that our wedding could be like a delicious chicken wing compared to the party in palm beach.
my team has been trying to perform your wedding for months to make the greatest and most elegant wedding this city has ever seen.
come on.
even when he was a secretary, he was always a boss
why are you such a hopeless romantic?
when your commission stops playing, the montecito will still be ahead, and that's all i care about.
let's go, guys
the guy with the tie said he told us a dozen of the air conditioning cold.
it can mark 00 floors and determine the game is rich.
he sits in that slot machine all night, rarely plays.
and he doesn't take his eyes off the blakjack table.
sperreos is happy to stand up and win a game a minute before he enters a game.
you can't prove it.
even if i count the cards, it's not
that's technically correct.
but we have a different kind of justice in vegas.
i can catch a cheat like before and destroy him in the desert.
i'll be honest with you, i'm old-fashioned.
please.
you're in the black book now that we have your picture.
if you set foot in from the montecito, i'll have you arrested in private.
you hear that?
hey, jack!
he's turned us down to 000,000.
you know as well as i do that he wasn't illegal unless he had a machine in the respect of the
at least we can have some fun with him.
it's not your story.
if someone is financing and teaching things, it's not the end of anything.
mike from last night, from mystique.
the guy from phoenix.
there are other cities that you're not really
des moines, for example.
it's amazing, but i gotta go
i'm devastating and burning, aren't
you finally said something i joined.
i think it should be you, 'cause i'm usually attractive
then what?
maybe i'm a little nervous around you because you're so
tongue-tied.
you know what we're gonna do?
what is it?
we're gonna sit down and try to figure out why you're not
patty.
almost there.
they said i was good?
it doesn't matter whether you're okay
i should fire you.
please.
thank you, thank you, thank you.
the tailor said he sent it back this morning, but there's no record of him being there.
our 000 friends are coming to this wedding tomorrow, the head of state, the industry leaders, oprah
would you like to tell oprah that the wedding was canceled and came to las vegas for nothing?
if we don't, the montecito will be happy to have the same.
that dress was a fashion masterpiece.
a dozen french ladies sewed it with a hand sucker
there's no other one like him.
you know how much that dress cost me?
that's a big problem, sam?
wait.
hey, danny, you asked me to look at big blackjack winners.
montecito's already spent millions on food, flowers, decor and fun.
if the wedding doesn't work out and lipworth refuses to give.
you really think someone stole it?
what's the street value on that thing?
why not the seamstress galina?
he was interested when he heard the price of the dress.
mike.
hey.
let me know how it went.
are these the same techniques sperreos and his team used?
we catch a team, they send someone else in a few hours.
if we don't find out who's behind this, we may have to give them the key to the safe.
you better start talking, you bastard.
are you talking to sperreos?
you better get your hands on me, because the president attacks me will cost me more than i've won from the montecito.
that was good.
did i buy the dress?
i just want to know what happened.
i make changes and give the dress to the montecito reporter.
is there a camera in the store?
i saw real diamonds in a costume for elton john.
compared to that, this dress is nothing.
galina protects herself.
you're free to go.
i'm helping, patty.
god knows why i accepted this project.
i always helped the baby bird, even if it was rabies.
then i'll get my tray.
this is christina, one of our best waitresses.
knees bent, back in the back.
more important than anything, trust.
trust.
the tray is full of martinis with its weight.
the hardest drink to carry.
he doesn't even look at the glasses.
he believes his ability to do it right, and here he is.
it's the
you're not so zen.
breathe with me, patty.
be a booze, patty.
you want me to sit here until mystique opens?
thank god i don't want you standing here like a karate boy.
call me sensei.
vic, you sent one of your guys to the store this morning to pick up a dress.
yeah.
do you remember who you sent?
the seamstress gave me a recording, but i couldn't remember
bart, you went to the store this morning to buy a dress.
no, i didn't go.
why not?
joey stopped me when i was coming out and wanted to go himself.
scan joey's face and get his address for me.
thank you.
i'm sorry
sea caviar.
why would he have his receipts on him?
did you hear from the dress?
yes, candy.
who's candy
not me, 'cause i know it's illegal here, but
do you know where we can find it?
danny mccoy, montecito surveillance and security.
how do you know nick sperreos?
cops don't scare me.
okay, wait, wait.
all right, all right.
that's enough
okay, i know him.
he came here a few times with his friends.
these his friends?
you know these guys?
yeah, i guess so.
nick's a good kid.
he asked me to cash in chips once.
i guess he thought i wouldn't doubt it.
strippers always get rewarded with receipts.
look, it was good for five minutes work, and i didn't have to take my clothes off.
why are you so interested?
because sperreos and his friends were involved in some kind of card counting operation.
i thought they were just some rich kids.
there's someone behind this, and i need to find out who.
do you have any idea who trained them and financing them?
they came one time with a big one.
yeah, they called him bucky.
mitch, did you scan joey's face?
fast forward.
somebody's paying him.
can you expand the picture?
no, but i can bring another angle.
so, lipworth's fiancée lissy?
we need to talk.
but you already know, right?
i know you paid to get rid of the wardrobe.
what i don't understand is why?
this wedding, the details, the cost, the cost, the cost
listen.
this is a little strange if you want to leave.
that's the point.
i don't know if i want to leave.
i love her, but her life...
i mean, how many of the 000 that came from my friend
people say it's a cinderella story.
i'm not cinderella.
i'm just a regular girl from new jersey.
i may not know too much, but considering my wedding was 00 times more expensive than my parents' home, my family
that's not true
yeah.
jared and i are so different.
i mean, what harm can it do?
how old do you think these kids are?
00, no bigger than 00.
danny, the yearbooks you asked for.
we'll see.
they're all in their mid-00s, and they all have the math skills to count cards.
then there must be kids in the math department who were trained and trained.
then i remembered, how can i bring them to their knees?
i started local colleges, considering how the second team arrived.
because you're a great guy, and i'm interested in people who are less attractive
maybe it's time for a
listen, mike, before this goes any further, there's something i have to say.
i came to vegas for "the brazen virginity kogr".
renewed.
i've made mistakes with men in my past, so i wanted to start a clean slate, and i made a vow of chastity until i got married.
i mean, just because i gave my present before doesn't make it less valuable.
the marrying officer is nice.
good.
what's up
do you want to go back to school?
i want to go back and do an anthropology degree and go into the rainforest and examine the local people.
you're an idiot.
what's up, ruben?
touch me and i'll call my lawyer right away.
you gonna call your lawyer?
what do you want?
where's bucky?
i don't know what you're talk
we have records of you robbing montecito.
i don't think students like that kind of stuff here.
i can call the dean right now and have your ass kicked out of here.
please, don't tell my family.
hey.
hey.
have you ever heard of a born-again virgin?
so you always knew that?
i'm sorry, but i could have any girl that i wanted, and it was getting ridiculous.
yeah, i set you up with someone very sweet and beautiful.
you were going to let him sleep with you.
hey, where are you going?
hey, mike.
i won't need you.
hey.
i've been such an idiot.
i needed some time to process all this.
do you think there's a place in your heart that can give me a second chance?
_
excuse me.
what was the valuable gift?
because i think it's after christmas paper clippings all over the paper.
look, i was reborn five or six times.
why isn't that me?
i tried to change.
so this is my fault?
i'm really sorry.
i took your advice.
i talked to jared and told him everything.
the wedding's
i said the wedding's off, not marriage.
is bucky training his crew here?
hey, ruben, if it's funny, get your parents on the phone
bucky.
mr. buckner?
you know him?
my high school math teacher.
i'm the head of security at the montecito
yeah.
remember miss buckner?
last year, he escaped with coach kajoyan.
alimony is killing me.
night school debts.
but the tax evasion is.
you guys made a lot of money in a lot of casinos
i'm guessing some of that money wasn't reported to the irs
keep these card counters away from the montecito, and we'll forget what happened.
before these kids get out, danny's gonna take pictures and information.
what's the name of the left dish
oh, my god.
did you miss the flowers, the caviar and oprah?
you know i don't care about those things.
the only thing that matters is spending the rest of my skateboard with you.
delinda, i'm sorry
she has to listen to you, honey.
i'll make you a star.
i hope you made a note of it.
careful, we're almost in.
do i know you?
vinny, she's hanging out with your
do you really want to risk your life for a skirt and a geezer?
any sign of the professor?
i speak six languages, why...
stein is gonna kill sara in the library.
the speedster has entered stein's disguise and is turning the ship over.
since when do you call him jax?
unfortunately, the effect won't last
what did you do to stein?
capone's men are taking over the ship.
you're here because i killed jsa's stupid leader.
it was mr. rex tyler, wasn't
i don't want to spend all night here.
you're welcome, you drunken maniacs.
my job is better.
i'm in charge of the entire arena.
every night, 00,000 people come here to have fun, and i make sure they have fun.
are you an actress?
yeah.
okay.
tell springsteen i'm the boss of this place.
don't say that.
anything he wants, just say it.
have you seen a hot marketing director around here?
where you been, man?
i have a meeting after the game.
how much time do we have left?
0 minutes, 00 seconds.
i can do a lot of things in 0 minutes, 00 seconds.
you're a funny girl.
i'm seeing other people.
i'm seeing other people.
happy birthday, ben.
how do you know?
morning.
all right.
happy birthday, ben.
you're a maintenance guy, aren't
two years ago, you said no matter what you said, "yes."
it's a little tricky because you don't always ask yes or no questions.
forget i said that for now.
there'll be a circus here tonight, and if there's ice on the floor, those fire-eaters may slip and fall over their sticks in front of
understand?
you told me not to run in the hallway.
forget about the conversation we had two years ago.
oh, no, no, no.
he wants to talk.
that's not good, dude.
melt the ice, bobert.
benjamin!
come here.
quick.
crystal, before you get upset and start firing everyone, about that ice...
have you seen a little white pill with some spanish written on it?
i don't understand your level of concern.
did i already take that pill?
hello.
yeah, i think you've already taken the pill.
i hate it when the circus gets here.
are they happy?
are they sad?
why are his pockets so big?
i bet you're talking about clowns.
morning, beautiful people.
morning, alonzo.
you are in an incredibly wonderful mood again.
every day is a beautiful day, my friend.
really, every day?
ben, that was the best day.
that was the day i stopped caring about myself and started committing to the great people of san diego.
what are you doing?
i gotta get that pill out of my system.
what about today's fund-raiser
i invested big money in unlawful himalaya dog racing.
one of the dogs allegedly bit a himalai.
anyway, i have a himalaya nightmare.
can't we use that money to make this place better?
okay, you're the owner, we'll do whatever you say.
did you see the oil painting?
don't forget to bring some kind of kids for
you know, black, white.
get me an asian kid
we're gonna need a cup.
the asian kid will give me a trophy.
you're right to clap, because these are very good ideas.
benjamin, i almost forgot.
your... son?
how's your new assistant working out?
thank you for that.
he set a man on fire?
there was an investigation.
the evidence was inconclusive
well, yeah.
he's good, isn't
she set him on fire.
not so good.
a-a-al-al...
alonzo... hel
what do you think it means when a girl sends a message, "we need to talk"?
i'm in something similar.
i think you'll find a better chance of getting closer.
what could be better than that?
yeah, that's what i thought.
happy birthday, little man.
morning, heather.
morning.
i'll tell you why i love it.
ben!
there's a man in his office, and he's
okay.
hi.
hi.
is there anyone here besides you, someone a little more attractive than you?
no.
okay.
i'm ben
i'm roman.
so you're crystal's son.
that must be terrible for you.
yeah.
it's not fantastic,
i wonder how they floated in the water.
okay.
i like mafia movies.
as a tal... as
this place is exciting.
political meetings, sports, rodeo, night soccer, motorcycles.
aren't you interested in any of this?
remember me?
i texted you three, and you didn't answer any of them.
i guess after five months of sleeping together, you'd have to learn that the missed messages are making me crazy.
look, i know we hate commitment.
i agree to this date relationship.
but this morning, i woke up at your house alone, which means you snuck out.
when i paid for the coffee, i couldn't find my underwear until i came out of my wallet.
i got another coffee with this, more... and more...
who is this?
i love mob movies.
and you, we really need to talk.
yes, it is, because it's a chance to get closer
what could be better than that?
this is a good business opportunity for you.
see you at christmas party.
i don't think that's what you meant
say it in spanish.
i speak a little spanish.
yeah, i never understood what you said.
actually, your english is very good.
elephant!
crystal.
did you hear what i just said?
i didn't hear
let me see this talk.
i don't think you should say, "yay, black kids!"
well, when do i say?
i don't think you should say anything.
and i wouldn't sing the song either.
there's still ice.
yeah, i know.
doesn't sound too sad to me.
this is the way you live.
you never wanted someone to be emotionally dependent on you, wondering how and where you are, kissing you in the morning, waiting for you at home.
what good is celebrating your birthday?
but you throw big parties on your own birthday.
i need to know i'll never be alone.
i'm not sure what i should do now.
i'll get out and you can step on the gas.
thank you.
niggers, whites, and asian and--
don't sing that song.
i think we should go out for dinner to celebrate my birthday.
that would be a good step for our relationship.
i think we should be together.
i'm willing to end this relationship.
why did you let me speak first?
you first.
you start all our next conversations.
remember we met with other people?
alonzo?
he's my best friend.
he's been wanting to live with me for a while.
he wants a commitment.
he wants a commitment?
we're talking about a man, right?
what a man.
look, i...
alonzo is an adult.
he cares about other people.
he asks questions about me, and he listens to my answers.
what bothers me is that i thought you and i were the same.
when you said you were emotionally damaged emotionally damaged,
how did he react when you told him?
he was already a very happy man.
it blew him up.
live with me.
we can do the commitment thing.
honey, i'm not the right woman for you.
you're sweet, and you're great for fun.
but no one can be the right person for you, because you only think of yourself.
what the hell was that?
i think the voice was coming through my head.
i can't be a frying master.
i guess so.
you know what the worst thing is?
i don't think about anyone but myself.
it's really impossible for me to take care of other people
suddenly, i feel the need to make contact, but i have no idea how to do this.
i'm in trouble, man.
kermit the frog, right?
yeah.
what about him?
i think it's a great
go, man.
sunlight.
hey, ben.
hi.
he's very attractive.
excuse me.
any of you know how to use an axe?
come on, clowns.
almost done.
keep breaking it.
good afternoon.
where's the asian
i specifically requested an asian kid.
there's an asian kid over there.
alonzo.
yeah.
yeah.
thank you.
they've stopped.
most people ask me why i love children so much.
maybe because i never had my own child.
i believe that our children's happiness is made by the society we want to live, and the efforts of the people living in this society.
their prosperity is our greatest gay, since they are our future.
when you ask them to do something for you, they do it with enthusiasm.
or as i got older, i started to believe that a life you live only for yourself is empty.
i wasn't going to, but i have to share a little song i wrote in this particular situation with you.
aside from the musical part, your speech was very touching.
sometimes it's really fun working with you.
i'm incredibly happy right now
on three, everyone say, "thank you, crystal cohen."
two... two... two
oh, my god!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
what a wonderful moment.
i noticed you left a little early.
hello again.
are you okay?
i'm a little scared
sure.
you know, it's normal that you think you're picking
i'm 000% positive i chose the right guy.
all right.
what a wonderful moment.
i've never done this before.
what if i'm not ready
what if he just acts like he wants me?
after having me, what if he doesn't want me anymore
of course he'll want you.
you have everything.
everything.
okay?
okay.
okay.
actually, we can make love one last time.
hey, crystal.
i really want to make love to her.
i'll see what i can do.
can you pay attention to the poor kid you're throwing in the air?
fortunately, i convinced them to publish this picture.
more than when you kicked the police.
less than sinking the mayor's ship.
great.
great.
while i've got you,...
i want you to sit down with someone who's childlike enthusiasm and loyalty is going to be an incredible asset here at the sunshine center.
get in the car.
get in the car.
i'm sure you have a lot to talk about.
great.
happy birthday, ben.
thank you.
hey.
what's your name
dan.
thank you, dan.
i forgot.
have you seen alice?
in his office.
it was business.
i... i
i know what you mean.
what would you do in a situation like this?
i think i'll run like my life depends on it.
yeah, that's what i'm gonna
they've set up security cameras looking directly at paddy.
melts in your mouth.
everything you say rebels.
this is bullshit friend.
these guys finally realized by living with me, that the exterior dee was so cool and so funny.
dee, you're undercover, okay?
dee, we're putting you on this mission, but the answer we got is insolence and questions?
maybe go up to the private office upstairs
do i have to know the guy who spaghetti's face?
and i'll buy one for the guy i don't know.
i said why.
'cause i think you've been hanging out pretty long
i didn't get it because charlie interrupted it with his fucking emergency lunch.
i don't want to be hit by anything you come across.
as i told that a few minutes ago, our fish today are exhausted.
instead, let's all buy a plate of hot tubes spaghett
extra sauce.
i've always wanted to see that.
comedians, baseball players, even protestors.
god bless the cream pie and america.
look, i'm an experienced businessman with a long history of asia countries.
imagine my cream pie recipe with your low-priced labor force.
the factory was closed for a few days because of all my accidents.
the truth is, we're pretty good at the chinese factory.
no need to worry, like she's okay.
just old pornography.
all aboard the tucker train.
it's not exactly what it looks like.
oh, no.
these are the things my children value when they're young.
besides, you know when you can't sell these disgusting things in the garage.
these cans show us how our lives are perfect.
like they always fake i.d. you?
the pictures i painted in kindergarten and the turkey hand?
i'm sorry, honey.
i put the finger in here because i have a feeling something's changed.
it's not just danny who's wearing a jersey uniform and hitting
they were in the basement next to the christmas lights, and i noticed miss bart lost his pushout.
i just didn't see you had a plan to win.
yeah, you gave us free beer and then said "vote for me" with the ballot box.
we're so lucky, everyone's backed
i'm not really into sports anymore.
god, it feels like it's from another life.
i need to hit things with a stick for beer.
okay, brawlers, i'd like to propose a pre-game toast.
maybe we'll remember that winning isn't everything, but we have a barrel of beer!
wait.
everyone, this is riley and my daughter emma.
so, wheeler is 0-0 in the unplanned pregnancy.
tuck, why don't you give something to the new arrivals?
ben!
that's what i know.
you're going out with mom?
i was gonna talk to myself, but bonnie said she'd handle it.
i handled it, but i didn't tell
you can't say you took it well.
i mean, they can have pillow in bed after dating your mom coach.
if i called the girl you did happy things hours ago, we'd be happy to have your voice cut off.
we could have more babies.
i'm going to practice until my brain is exhausted.
she throws her food around, i think she makes it beautiful.
her father's
mom will come soon, will you take the equipment downstairs to the court for me?
this is heavier than my previous weight.
you don't care about the cups on the shelf,
sounds like i missed the game.
you missed one little thing.
the kids voted riley to be the captain.
i said it was definite.
i was feeding my baby and you took my team away.
i was wearing your glove... and then everyone started yelling.
"you're amazing!"
because i heard it was unbelievable.
maybe if you come over, you'll do good things i haven't done in a long time
because i don't care what the others say.
"your faces, suckers." i am so excited!
we just ate some italian food.
that's why i'm trying to stop you.
honey, i don't think we should talk about these parts, these things about my personal life.
okay, honey, i know you don't want to hear this, but i'm a woman and i need it.
when i won't even open my mouth.
"to wear the hook."
i don't want anyone to cancel their plans.
thank you, danny.
not yet, but it will be solved.
honey, are you okay?
i tried to get here as soon as i could.
with my hair and that, you're 00 minutes away.
i couldn't call anyone who could take care of emma.
the dentist said he should see you right away.
and remember, don't bring home the giant toothbrush.
for the bathroom key.
i'm sorry about your date with hank.
i shouldn't even be talking to you right now.
please tell me emma's in the car park outside.
hank canceled something or i don't know the details.
but if my mom asks, they kept me here.
you care about other people's happiness.
to make him not see and hope he doesn't understand.
dude, i need you back.
you think he stopped being rigantor?
will he make me whisper small planets in my head?
will you look here?
the minister has gone home.
if it's not hank, he's like somebody
do you have a menu down here?
mom, i'm home.
what are you doing here?
i'm sure that's my robe.
hank, you ready for round two?
danny, there's nothing going on here
you're unbelievable.
yeah, she hates it.
because we're not watching the same game here.
it's actually full of vodka.
we'll drink this and then we'll throw
we have a chance to make a clean shot.
sit down, wheeler next to the other ladies.
what about riley?
okay, tuck, your turn.
hit again, miss and don't go out in the field.
when i told riley something she shouldn't have heard, she ate my crayons.
i still can't forget you ate the brownish.
don't worry, i'll watch your back, okay?
hey, teammates.
don't you think she looks cute today?
is that my phone?
it's about the play.
thank god.
i was worried i wouldn't bring you back.
i know what you're thinking, but you gotta do something other than control the team.
like i'm doing now?
i want you to be more serious in the games.
i find it harder to put you on the squad than the others.
to tell you the truth, i should get you off the team.
but i can't
i'm really gonna miss you when i don't move you.
thank you.
what did you want to tell me?
just... just
"tick, riley's gone.
"i'm firing him right now."
what is this?
that's the bad version of what i just told you.
coach, can we talk?
i think you want your robe back.
it didn't
my mother told me what happened.
i'm really sorry about that reaction.
i'll tell him i'll be better next time.
i don't think there'll be a next
don't blame him for being a punk.
so you're keeping a funny woman out of your league?
no, that's my mother you're talking about
and someone who goes out with him is very lucky.
i'll go out with him
it'll be safe if you take him
what's wrong with me?
maybe you're just too smart and too beautiful.
winning is fun for you.
oh, my god, i like this!
but what does that get me?
the room's full of trophies and no one's sharing it with me?
danny seems to have figured it out
yeah, none of us can be like your brother.
yeah, i think i've heard it a couple or a thousand times.
right.
right.
i was thinking of a change for the win.
i've never tried it before.
yeah, i think you should figure out how to expose the real brawlers without me.
ben, nobody wants me.
go brawlers!
all thanks to my lovely sidekick captain.
if it wasn't for the riley ref.
he really needed a new cup.
no, i can't hide anymore.
honey, you gotta help me.
the fear in his eyes caused them to close.
get lost.
don't worry.
i'll find a man who can make you happy.
okay.
he seems to be getting better.
i know my son when i see him.
like i always say, thank god for giving me ben.
do the wheeler, do the wheeler...
what's riley doing?
they call him wheeler.
we'll use you to track it from the inside.
why is patty interested in this murder?
i suggest mr. purcell not answer any more questions.
you were found in your home alone with your wife's body.
there's no sign of a break-in.
patty, i saw the man who did this.
our company was hired to do toxicological research on a chemical compound.
these companies are worth hundreds of billion dollars.
michael, this is daniel purcell.
we have a protection problem.
she's the chief consultant for the world's
did you tell anyone about us?
acid rain from the coal-burning plantation makes the bullets level 00 times above the national average.
the residents tried to sue a class action.
so over 000 cases have been filed against them in the last three years?
why didn't he bribe you
i wonder the same thing, but i don't know how patty knew we were setting tom up.
what have you found on purcell?
we have to make sure our secret doesn't show up so we can move forward.
it's okay with me.
ellen, i know it's disappointing, but you have to back off.
we'll all retreat.
it might help me.
i have no experience in criminal law.
we must have chased him out before he could find time to steal something.
it was dark the first time.
you know, the other night, i was wondering if someone stirred up the houses.
isn't it your job to find out, detective?
let's see if there's anything in the photos that can refresh your
mr. purcell didn't come here to be harassed.
he always did.
this is a very important development, mr. purcell.
you find the ring, you find my wife's killer.
mr. purcell, i believe you.
because the person who killed christine is still out there somewhere and you were absolutely useless.
you can't use these against me.
don't answer that.
i swear you're pretending to be arrested.
the only incident that happened three years ago is not probable cause
no, but it's like he's lying about everything.
i mean, two break-ins and nothing stolen.
didn't the contaminant hurt health?
we spoke on the phone a couple of times, but i guess he's still unacceptable.
he wants to introduce me to the man he's with
if there's anything we need to know, patty will tell us when she's ready.
whatever you've infected the company, it's better if nothing else comes out of stolen documents.
if you wonder what happened to christine purcell, look at the grieving widow.
my only job is to protect mr. kendrick, and if you've done anything to expose him or ultima national resources...
everything okay in new york?
daniel purcell to meet patty hewes.
do you have any reason to believe that ultima national resources was involved in the murder of your wife?
i've watched many farm animals die these days.
00 years ago, he used daniel purcell as an expert witness and won a case.
so why would ibc global's report suggest that the 000 perm is acceptable?
daniel purcell was a brilliant man, but when he faced patty, he collapsed.
no, this is just another big conspiracy to uncover.
as soon as i tell you what i know about ultima national, you put me aside.
whatever he tells you, you can't trust him.
i don't know who killed your wife, but you'll be blamed for it.
and he worked together before purcell ibc global.
about nine months after purcell's testimony, michael was born.
just the two of
we will face the unexpected elements.
we'll neutralize them with a massive attack.
on three.
one, two, three.
shoot them!
detective stark?
excuse me.
yeah.
that guy over there.
and did you pull him over on the 00th?
am i sworn?
i'd appreciate it if you would stop asking that question
mr. young was the one you pulled over on the 00th?
and if you don't say it again, i don't
what?
you know what this is, you son of a bitch?
it wasn't a real bomb
"no blood, no guilt."
not legally, detective.
even a bomb threat is a clear physical threat.
terrible sanitation.
i think your shirt is scary.
your honor, we demand the dismissal of the case.
liz, i don't know what to say.
he's your partner, jack.
that's not good enough, jack.
we've been trying to catch wayne young for years.
i, uh,
jack, what are you going to say?
i need to be alone.
you want some chips?
no, i don't want chips, dan.
i think they put spices in it.
it feels better.
you wrecked the case, dan...
but it's a state case
you mean your ex-girlfriend's case?
they're finishing the investigation.
that means no more department income.
department income?
and fight crime with sticks?
we need financial resources to investigate.
tell you what.
good luck with that.
you'll see.
good day to you all.
see you in hell.
here it is.
i thought you might remember that.
you're absolutely right.
hey, do you have any nicotine gum with you?
i can't imagine myself without them
because i left those cancer sticks.
that's it.
okay, we need to do a few errands.
first, i gotta get myself a shotgun.
you misunderstood!
there's a misunderstanding!
please!
i made a deal while you were in jail.
for both of us.
what kind of deal?
heroin.
it's near south
i put it in one of our trucks.
i have a client.
and this is just the beginning.
if it does, we bring more heroin.
wayne, we're so close together!
you meet the man, we make the delivery.
what about the cops?
they can't come after you across the border!
the cops can't do anything!
rough day?
yeah.
is this about the girl or the job?
you're gonna need a second donut.
hey, dan.
what's up?
of course.
i'll tell liz about it in the morning.
i'll call you back.
freeze!
okay.
okay.
freeze!
i'm not moving!
why are you attacking me?
you're hurting the holy bond.
i have three warrants on me.
being a cop isn't the first thing to do.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
how would you feel if the warrant was removed?
when you say "no concealed"...
"julius, you don't have to go to jail."
'cause that's what
i'm all yours, man.
you can do whatever you want with me.
i want to know about wayne young.
i know that.
i know wayne young.
as you wish?
all i want is a piece of paper, pencil and writing... a piece of
do it.
he has a place from oakwood, okay?
that's it.
does that make us good?
we're gonna put him in jail
we're fine.
okay.
because i want to hug you.
you can hug me.
all right.
thank you so much, man.
okay.
okay.
what can i do for you, jack?
i was talking to dan... dan...
it means everything is according to the book... so it's
not exactly your partner's style.
actually, that's why i can send him home.
don't worry about it
just tell me how to fight wayne.
okay.
i'll see you at the office at 0:00.
wayne works in a garage in east dallas.
working for a company like shell.
but what do we arrest him for?
we'll think of something when we get there.
no, dan.
we'll do a preliminary research.
yeah, that'll work.
by the... by
how did you know where wayne was working?
am i still under oath?
this is the address.
hello!
that's weird
what did you say about coming in and looking at the truck?
and this?
do we have to disarm the intruder?
they should know security sucks.
besides, nobody gets in here without a helmet.
you mean us?
hey, ours is a violation.
if you don't spend more than $0.00, then
that's why i'm
it's like a
it makes you angry, but it doesn't do anything to calm you down.
everything gets worse.
what the hell is this place?
what are they doing here?
we don't know... we
i have to call liz.
just... just
dan, what are you doing?
dan, we can't be here.
what you're doing is illegal, dan?
okay?
this truck is full of boxes.
yeah.
boxes full of crime.
come on.
we're over a 00-foot drop.
i can feel the whining in my back!
another excuse for the report.
listen, dan.
we got off to a bad start here, okay?
did you hear something?
start the car.
i'll close the back.
dan, this is an illegal investigation, okay?
if we get caught, we're in big trouble!
your phone's ringing.
jesus!
i hate it.
hello.
hello, detective dan.
it's julius, man.
how's our parole deal going?
hey, i can't talk
i'm behind wayne young's truck.
long story.
there's a big man with a
caesar, caesar, the right of caesar, pac
looks like things are going well.
you're glad you didn't blow my head off with a shotgun, aren
it was just a little misunderstanding, wasn't
yeah.
let's make some money.
yeah, me too.
shit!
what the hell is that?
thanks for coming.
i die slowly.
you look good.
i'm not okay.
you know about my parole.
the cop i made the deal was trapped in one of wayne young's trucks.
there's no truck in there!
i mean, i have a girlfriend in jamaica.
maybe we'll come back here and open a motel
okay, but why am i here?
you'll introduce me to wayne young.
you two are friends, he... he's... you
that's a very deep word.
we're more like colleagues, man.
he wanted me to take weed to the north sometimes, that's all.
skeeter, dear... dear
you got to find this truck, and you got to find it now, man.
look, i'll give you $000.
he's a monster, man!
he cut off a man's thumb once!
just like his fingers were lost!
that's disgusting, dude!
i love this car.
including the sound system?
and the hubcaps?
you can have them, too.
you can have your ashtray, skeeter.
just find the truck for me, okay?
all right, i'll help you find the truck.
i didn't mean to yell at you.
that's where his real joke
they won't examine the entire cargo.
what the hell was that?
don't panic
dan, this is texas, okay?
you just described 00,000 square miles.
god damn it!
then let's break the door so we can jump out.
what's wrong with what?
physics, dan.
it's suicide.
not if you jump fast enough, man.
we're gonna bring the truck at zero.
come on.
why are you acting like such a bad thing?
we got wayne young right where we want him.
yeah.
two stripped of weed from the countryside.
exactly.
i'm detective jack bailey.
please leave a message, i'll call you back.
well, it's been 00 minutes
congratulations.
you're officially going the same way with your partner.
still waiting for your boyfriend?
detective bailey is not my lover.
jack.
wherever you are, i hope you're enjoying yourself.
all i know is they're somewhere in the south
how are you?
thank you very much
man, what's taking so long?
dude, you asked me to find a criminal, right?
can we just focus, please?
where's the truck with the police?
that way.
so i'm just going this way?
what happens that way?
i'm working on the ropes.
dude, you...
i think he had a deal with a man.
dude, you're gonna kill me
you're definitely gonna kill
you know anything else?
i heard he had a scary look.
besides, he wasn't from
we can make the deal on thursday.
i'm not british.
i'm from south africa.
yeah, there's a giraffe in south africa
see you thursday.
that's it.
coming with you wasn't part of our deal.
hey.
do you want my car or not?
yes, i do.
that's what i thought.
thank you.
good night.
you have interesting friends, man.
he was wearing these weird boots, man.
i have those boots!
yeah.
what else was i supposed to do?
we're partners, right?
you'd do the same for me.
any other deals?
is there anything i should know?
that's it.
dan, what are you doing?
good luck.
i'll take care of it.
what are you doing?
am i not like someone who tries not to go crazy?
apparently.
i haven't opened them all yet.
are you looking for scented?
let me ask you something, dan.
like i said, these boxes are full of crime.
yeah... ye
think you can help?
this needs a little more lighting.
mystical sunrise.
natural.
i like that.
don't die on me, dan.
don't die on me, dan.
don't die on me, dan.
dude, will you shut up?
i'm trying to talk on the phone!
yeah.
sort of.
it's in lubbock, "lil's an antique shop."
i don't know, man
it's like a souvenir shop.
besides... also
jesus.
i've learned some information about the south american guy.
excellent.
just focus on where the deal is going.
save the moustache.
save the moustache.
the smell of the candles is starting to drown
they smell like mysterious sunrise.
i think i'm gonna puke
if you puke, i'll light more candles.
no.
give me that.
at least 0 kilos.
heroin.
it's heroin.
high pure.
small particles.
it's probably from
wow, you know a lot about heroin.
thank you.
so you're saying you planned this?
i mean, being a cop is a team
and you, jack.
that's how we ended things together.
really?
we call it, " catch it, catch it again."
bad guys run around with guns all on their own.
good cops chase criminals with a gun in their hands.
thanks for the career advice.
hey, listen, dan... dan...
what?
the truck is stopping.
why are we here so early?
what kind of trouble did you pick?
this little town is right between the states.
i mean, it's about 000 miles from the nearest
we don't get caught.
we don't even exist here.
just in case.
hello.
don't worry about the guys with the
mikkel likes to carry heavy weapons just in case it's
i'm not worried.
it's so good to see you.
looks like we're doing a little work.
put the shotgun down.
on your knees.
excuse me?
i said, "get on your feet."
hey, hey, hey, hey,
what you're doing
what the hell is going on here?
i'm sorry, wayne.
i made a deal, you son of a bitch!
everybody wins.
exactly.
what?
okay.
okay.
no confusion.
how was the meeting?
both unbelievable.
we'd better shoot them both and take the product.
son of a bitch.
i should have killed you when i had the chance.
enough!
let's finish this.
get the heroin out of here.
open the truck.
smell that?
come on!
come on!
remember, stick to the plan.
just the two of
we will face the unexpected elements.
we'll neutralize them with a massive attack.
come on!
what the hell?
"b" do you have plans?
come on, run!
shoot them!
traitor, son of a bitch!
i don't like the plan "b"!
isn't it a little early for you to visit here,
i heard about the dan stark machema fiasco.
what?
it's about detective bailey.
he usually comes around somewhere warm.
i found an address on jack's table last night...
hey!
we had a deal!
good afternoon.
looks like you're in a bit of trouble
not as good as it looks
i think we're safe for now.
don't ever say "all clear" again!
let's go!
who are these guys?
i don't know and i don't care
just kill them all and bring me the heroin.
cover me.
i'll call the lieutenant and call for backup.
lieutenant ruiz.
yes, lieutenant!
this is detective bailey!
you haven't checked in the last six hours.
where the hell are you?
it's a long story, ok
detective stark and i need backup.
send code 0 if you can!
"lil's an antique shop."
lubbock is 00 minutes away.
all right, we're under heavy fire!
it's 0 hours away, detective.
what the hell are you doing there?
long story.
just as many men as you can send, okay?
we're too late, man.
we're too late.
this stupid deal happened five minutes ago.
where's the address
there must be somewhere around here.
man, come on.
here?
yeah.
he's back
we just passed.
this is not a safe ride!
then you can talk about driving.
backup comes in 00 minutes.
sounds about right.
we gotta get the bad guys back up to the
we deal with the cavalry on the road.
good idea, dan.
right there.
go!
if we're going to die, it must be in a real car!
ready?
i expect you to say "go."
let's go!
get in the car!
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
you don't know how to contact?
what did they teach you at the academy?
go!
go, go, go, go!
son of a bitch
you!
can't you make it go faster?
it had a good engine!
this car is dead!
maybe we should have taken sedan.
you want some?
dan, when did you get that chocolate?
i went back to the store when you were on the phone.
almond walnut with almond-
son of a bitch
i want that heroin!
i don't think it's too good anymore
what, you think i haven't noticed?
take it!
come on.
come on!
hang in there
beautiful!
that's exactly what i wanted.
that's what scared me.
no movement.
i think we're all clear now.
you see what i see?
looks like a flaming truck.
got it!
i dropped it!
get down!
you okay?
yeah, i'm fine.
but i was better.
yeah.
you bastard!
got it!
he's taking the heroin and running
jack.
partner, we have a bigger problem.
lower your weapons.
where's heroin?
you're lying!
he's not l
we left him in the middle of the road.
"paco" ran off with it.
who are you?
what were you doing behind the truck?
we're officers.
are you a cop?
are you kidding me?
i'm not.
julius!
you did it!
i'll explain later.
can i hug you?
yeah, you can hug me.
come on!
okay.
you better get out of here.
register your weapon!
what the hell was that?
we hugged.
i'm a hugger.
it looked like there was a walnut stock.
anyway, he ran right over here...
no sign of paco.
what about heroin?
no sign of him either.
looks like he got away with it.
he doesn't have any witness
and wayne young will testify against paco.
and i'm sure he's going to say exactly
"i will drag the law into hell with me."
well, this will do.
yeah, but you know what's not gonna work?
i had no idea to be involved in this.
it just happened.
you came all the way out here worrying about me?
no.
i came all this way to see wayne young arrested.
i'm so sorry, jack.
well, i stole a sports car and set the truck on fire.
did you even think about that?
we're questioning the south african guy.
did you know that giraffes live there?
it's almost fe
dan played pure heroin, okay?
it's hard to take as a victory
"i can't say, "i can't say we
what do you mean?
don't ever say "all clear" again!
cover me.
i'll call the lieutenant and call for backup.
yes, lieutenant!
i'm detective bailey.
it's a long story, ok
send code 0 if you can!
hey, old man... old

five dollars.
this is a brick.
that's a hand-p
i'll give you three dollars
okay.
here.
three dollars.
how much for the chocolate?
00 cents each.
why did i do that?
i was hungry.
not the chocolate.
what made you change the packages?
well, you said everything would be in the book, right?
yeah.
exactly.
i won't waste your time.
i brought you the best merchandise.
it's the best heroin money can buy.
it's easily worth $000,000.
wholesale price.
here.
"the alamo memories," huh?
well, listen.
stop.
wayne young was captured within 00 hours and...
it's all $0
actually, $0.00.
all i have to do is...
like i said, being a cop is teamwork.
but most of it is not living like desert.
hunters here spend their lives looking for rare and difficult prey.
000 tonnes of weight is the greatest animal ever lived by 00 metres long.
despite their great size, the blue whales are the most aerodynamic and energy-minded in all the floating animals.
they can travel over 000 miles a day in harts.
it takes a lot of effort to open your giant mouth, so only when you see a pack of rich and dense.
feeding opportunities are often rare here.
when they're all done, the hunters must continue their search for the
frigate birds, pirates of open sea.
frigate birds must be so light 'cause they can't have heavy oils that waterproof other sea birds.
small fish try to hide in the ocean's only protected dead waves.
with the extra thrust in their tails, the flying fish can take off more than once.
with a good wind, they can float hundreds of meters.
all open ocean hunters can't go looking for food.
so he can barely swim.
this brown seaweed must lie in wait, protected amongst the moss.
in this open ocean, these quid are far more demanding than cubs who want to hide.
finally, first opportunity in weeks.
he can only make a move when he's a few inches away
trusting his perfect camouflage, he hides in the orphans.
the open ocean is so vast that some hunters can only find enough prey by searching as a team.
dolphins live in highly advanced social groups.
they can work together to cover a vast area of the ocean.
you know, small groups sometimes come together to generate a 0,000-dollar
they use some kind of radar to find their prey.
but these little fish spend most of their time in the deep ocean, where dolphins can't reach.
they only hunt when they go up to the surface to feed.
when they find a large herd, dolphins use their radar for another purpose.
as the dolphins feed, they come from underneath the herd to prevent their prey from escaping safely depths.
down here, food is scarcer than at the surface, so hunters must do whatever it takes to protect their precious energy.
most only drift by drifting with lethal needles.
others are slowly leading the darkness into the darkness with their roses.
beroe is the top jelly predator in deep water.
now, beroe has special-like mosquitoes in her mouth to catch jelat's hunts.
this deep-sea squid uses long sticky tentacles to hunt.
the open ocean may be a vast blue desert, but like any desert, there are savages.
the sea stretches its deep ocean currents upward to the surface of its nutrients.
success here depends on delicate maneuvers.
hiding in a plain sight, giving your prey a false sense of trust.
the lionfish's stripes are visually confusing, so it's hard to predict how close he is for his prey.
and the extravagant fins he used to hide his slow tail movements are making him even superior.
these deep-water currents that survive so many residents also attract visitors to these oasis.
they travel hundreds of miles between the sea mountains they used as a gathering point.
both sharks travel between the galapagos and the other seabird mountains east of the great ocean.
no one knows why they've collected so many, but some certainly come to these savages looking for food.
if these little fish stay close to the lentils, the sharks won't be able to
as long as the silverfish are close to the ocean floor, they can avoid predators.
there's never an easy meal in the open
here, exposed to storm, water creates its nutrients, transporting nutrients to the surface, creating isolated areas.
black browed albatross are the same size as frigate birds, but three times as heavy, so it needs a totally different kind of flight.
albatross is the type of bird with the longest wingspan and that allows the southern ocean winds to benefit from its power.
first, they glide against the wind, use his energy to get high.
and then they turn and swoop at the wind, and they
they spend weeks at sea searching for prey without ever returning to land.
because the winds are so strong here, albatrosses can't afford the weight of waterproofing oils.
they can duck dive to one meter, so they rely on the southern sea to carry their prey up into range.
like all birds, albatross have to lay eggs on land, but there are very few, very few, very good islands in the south atlantic that are very crowded.
nearly half a million albatross come here every year to raise their young.
adults share parenting duties, returning every few days to feed their offspring.
after the feeding process, it's time to head for the sea
albatross are so heavy they can only take off where the wind is strong enough.
from the air, the ocean may seem unique, but beneath the surface, there are strong currents that are constantly moving.
these currents are more effective than any other force determined by the distribution of life here.
all organisms that are dragged across the ocean are bound to these flow.
they come together to feed on tiny, animal, and fresh plankton, which brings the tiny, tiny, tiny, t
the feathers on their legs slow their dreams, and they swim up a few tails, still feeding.
the currents that carry this mobile crabs also work for the ocean's big predators.
with the perfect aerodynamic structure, they can travel the longest distance with minimum effort.
these hunters touch a shuttle between the ocean currents that often gather.
each predator has a sensible sense of smell that can detect any indistinct trails left.
great shoals are charming to plankton loads.
a pack of sardines can be many miles long.
self-defense depends on match.
when the attack arrives, the sardines act as one.
any fish instantly matches the movements of the one next to him, and the entire herd will act on a full-time
even when more sea lions arrive, they don't seem to break the sardines' coordinated defenses.
the sea lions need to separate a large number of smaller-control groups.
but with so few predators the fish still have the advantage.
all the sea lions can do is keep the sardines on the surface and wait for others to join them.
tuna attack from below, so the sardines cut their way into the deep water.
as the fish bother the safes, their pack strategy now makes it easier for the hunters.
tonnes of sardines run out in less than an hour.
the predators once again disappear into the blue.
this blue whale is still searching for food to satisfy its unending hunger.
because it's so big it has to find an average of 0 tons of food
it's a crowded croquet of fish trapped in the surface because
this blue whale has finally found what he's been looking for a long
a big dinner big enough to open your big mouth.
it's hundreds of metres long, and it's clusted to the bottom.
the whale is targeting the busiest part of the pack, and it's moving in
it takes a lot of effort to swim with a fully expanding throat, and the whale is experiencing a calamity.
as he uses his tongue to get the whale juice out of his mouth, the crops are saving in the plates that are lined
but it takes time to soak so much water.
blue whales may not be as nimble as the other hunters, but they don't have to
no other predator is more fit to exploit the foul richness that the open oceans provide.
the blue whale is the greatest hunter in all the world's
the open ocean created many challenges for the "av" team.
it's been a two-year mission to accomplish
the team worked with the world's biggest blue whale expert, john calambokidis.
john received vital information from these harmless labels.
part of this investigation and part of the reason we're working with filmmakers is that it gives us a unique chance to acquire scientific data.
that's why we're doing what they're doing underwater, how they're diving, how they're swimming, making them an investigation into what they're feeding.
the team's success depends on a good underwater net.
too heavy and the whale is literally disappearing into the darkness.
we couldn't
the first year has been affected by vulnerability, and the shooting ended in failure.
second year, sea conditions are better.
blue whales only surface every 0-0 minutes before diving for 00 minutes.
he's got to try to move the boat forward to the whale, but not in front
then he's got to hope david's going in the water and that the whale passes close enough to get a record.
this year's water is unusual, but it still takes time to keep david in a good position.
after weeks of effort, eventually all the elements come together and give david the chance of his life.
it took me too long, too long.
i mean, it was so big, it was like a freight train.
the images of the water under the blue whale are rare, so it's a tremendous achievement to record a simply swimming whale.
this series is all about hunting, so it's a nice shot, but we need to get a picture of the blue whales eating krill to complete the episode.
and we have to wait for the krill to surface.
once a month, maybe twice.
the team is hitting a hopeful sign, but it's a rather unpleasant source.
look at those birds in the water!
we'll go take a look.
look at this majesty!
i still don't understand what i just saw.
david saw it, turned the camera.
he took a turn, went up and got a big bite.
the reason they call them blue whales is because you see them underwater, brilliant, flaming cobalt blue comes out of the blue of the ocean.
i was upstairs trying to get another image of the krill, and, honestly, one last time, it was open.
it's probably less than ten minutes, but without a doubt, without question, it was the most amazing thing i've ever seen.
it's something i'll never forget, to share water with a blue whale and observe.
and the opposite.
yeah, that's a unique perspective we'll never see.
with this close cooperation, the team has filmed blue whales as never before and is finally uncovering the secret life of the ocean's greatest hunter.
you like her!
no, i don't.
every friend i've ever introduced without exceptions likes him.
it's pathetic, isn'
when mia went on exchange, we made a list of pros and cons, and it helped clarify our feelings.
yes, ethan karamakov... .
abigail sent a list of pros and cons to the entire school.
look, i'm coming to stay with you for a while.
no, i won't cause any trouble.
i won't stay forever.
okay.
double battement frappe.
and petit battementent.
everyone thinks farm's a dangerous place.
relieve.
i know every rabbit hole, broken fence and rusty nail.
and nice sleeves.
no matter where i am, i'm safe.
in, tara.
and blance.
everybody come out.
tara, you can join us.
but the academy is a completely different world.
if you think you know your way, think again.
you realize you're actually in a minefield.
wherever i go, i see a new trap...
"he smells like christmas...
"the way he eats.
everything he talks about is true.
could it have been worse?
yes, as you ask...
at least i'm not the first minus on your list.
i guess i should be grateful for that.
i'm really sorry, kat.
i didn't mean to involve you in my confusion.
believe me, i tried so hard not to feel this way.
here's a good reason.
my brother will break your heart, and when he does, i will not be there to repair the pieces.
i promise i'll stay away from him.
do you think abigail sent it to third grade?
ethan read it.
kill me.
yeah, one question for you.
who can tell me the real meaning of 'pas de de deux'?
pas deux.
it means mate dancing.
but what is the meaning in french words, metaphorically?
pas deux.
two bodies, one soul.
a man and a woman dance with the same emotions.
that's what today's class is
i've never danced with a man before.
that's right.
at home, girls danced with girls.
there were no men.
men in first class are just cute creatures who squash their fingers
pas de deux has three important rules.
trust.
throw it at someone
together.
great wonder wonder
and, most important of all, communication.
without these, yes...
ethan, isabelle, it's very kind of you to join
remember, in order to be together, you have to trust and communicate.
do your hands always work like this?
i'm allergic to you.
focus on who you're dancing with.
no one else should matter.
you want to drop it?
relax.
you're doing pretty good.
what a great class?
i mean, patrick's such an amazing teacher.
don't you think the universe is trying to bring us together?
la-la-la-la-la.
before you go, miss raine and i talked about not teaching for the rest of your days.
don't get excited.
instead, you will exercise for me.
don't forget, you'll be processed, just as you are in other classes.
that was a blow!
i'll be walking a blindfolded dog.
at least you don't have to spend 00 hours with abigail like me.
i'd rather rip my eyes off with a blind blade.
i know we'll ask our wives 00 questions in 00 hours.
this?
"one of you can ask each of you any questions any questions
"but you must answer honestly."
like i want to know something about christian.
so you're not alone.
my bowler, my favorite meal, pizza, lucky number, and we're done.
i know all about you.
your life is being broadcast to the whole school.
where are you going?
beach.
i love this city.
i want to control it too.
i'm going to go find christian.
we'll be there, check out the pretty girls.
great!
oh, i'm starting to like this paper.
are you a slayer or something?
so where did you grow up?
a suburbs.
by the beach?
you're lucky
you think i'm rich?
do you have a brother or sister?
he lives in broken hill.
i meant emotionally close.
so, the room is made of flesh and blood.
he's just doing something.
you have to answer.
says who?
rules.
how far have you gone with a man?
there's first base.
and there's second base.
anybody in your city?
have you ever kissed a man?
you didn't kiss, did you?
maybe i can help you.
maybe you can get out of my sight.
hey, i had more questions to ask.
and here i am trying to strengthen my tummy.
we can do these on the beach.
i won't come to the beach
are you allergic to fresh air?
i don't like sand, i don't like salt and i don't like sun.
great.
i need water.
me, too.
we hate you enough to ask you to die of thirst.
i don't care what his favorite color or his family do.
so did he tell you anything?
he did it!
"oh, let's go to the beach for homework.
"it'll be so much fun!"
i didn't know he was gonna be
really.
what are you doing here?
third grade we come to ourselves.
you shouldn't be bitching here right now.
you can play with us if you want.
i may be blindfolded, but i'
come on, it's just football.
whoo!
coming, tara?
i think i'm staying.
i haven't finished my homework with christian yet.
come on, we're getting out of here
you know, in this scenario, it's in the toilets
you can hold on.
no, i can't hold it for 00 hours
i'm starving.
yeah, me too.
i'm gonna
i'm gonna go get some food.
this place is closed for smoking.
find another toilet.
why do men's toilets have to smell so
why do you have to be so bad?
that's right.
they stink.
what you did was more than just a crime and an eun
just think about it and finish it quick before we both die of oxygen.
i can't, can you please hum a song or something?
hurry up.
i still don't understand why you sent that list to everyone.
you're just as uncomfortable as a fliesy fly.
it just made you look bad.
okay, don't say anything.
there you go.
hey, where's tara
i don't know.
huh.
whoa!
hey, baby.
there's plenty of room in my lap.
hey!
i wrote that, princess!
come on, we'll catch them later.
you want to die?
didn't you see what they were trying to do to me?
you can't fight around here.
anyway, what are you still doing here?
if you want to know, i was waiting for the bus.
what did you see me in a limo?
you don't know anything about me.
i don't think i want to know.
i've never met anyone as rude as you.
didn't your mother teach you manners?
he's dead
look, if you're curious, all you have to do is call.
who said i was curious?
i'm just checking my messages.
what do you know?
i can understand everything.
this whole communication thing must be working.
really?
can you see that?
ow.
i can't imagine what it's like to lose your mother.
no, you can't.
was she dancing?
yes, when he was young.
is that why you wanted to go to the academy?
you'll leave?
i won't.
i don't believe you.
i saw you dance!
right.
he lives in broken hill.
very good.
and let's say i got in trouble.
i don't know, probably
you said you were close.
so you're saying he answered, right?
brothers help their brothers.
maybe it will until you call her.
the room only answers when you call another number, so she doesn't know it was me.
now you know everything.
right or wrong?
i'd like to say wrong, but...
see, you've learned nothing.
my brother and i are close.
i have one question left.
question 00.
ask him.
why did you tell everyone i was dressed in the wrong locker room?
you knew it was a mistake.
why would i even bother?
i can't believe you're still lying about it.
i know you did.
you know, i wasn't the only guy there.
have you thought about it?
tara, what were you thinking?
do you think...?
do you think it says 0-0 here or 00?
two and four hours.
you want to know why i'm bad with tara?
because you three are so stupid!
i need to talk to you.
like you don't know.
you've been laughing behind me all this time, haven't
excuse me?
you told everyone i was in the wrong locker room this week.
it was you, wasn't it
come on, admit it was a funny thing.
and leaving me on the beach alone?
fun, isn't it?
but you weren't with us.
not to answer my pros and cons list?
i didn't realize i had to answer.
of course you had to.
the whole school is laughing at me because of
why would it be because of me?
look, if you want to hear the truth, i was embarrassed about that list.
i mean, we only talked to you three or four times, right?
and you went and wrote every feeling and sent it to the whole school.
i don't even know you.
tara?
tara?
he can't talk to you.
yes, he can.
i thought you were sick of girls coming to you after ethan.
because i hate seeing my friends get upset.
growing up, my parents warned me of all danger.
we have to realize everything here ourselves... we have to
prove to me yesterday's paper is not a waste of time.
nice work, guys.
whether we like it or not, we're bound by ropes that won't let us go next year at all.
so there's a long way ahead of us.
morning.
morning, bette.
uh-huh.
get dressed.
i want to be there when they open it.
okay.
i already threw a candy.
just one.
here's your napkin.
you want butter?
here.
morning.
be careful.
the inspector's
morning, mrs. tremont.
morning, mr. korman.
mr. tremont.
hi.
yeah.
what can i do for you, mrs. tremont?
it says pork chops are sold here.
everything you've seen in this row is all in advertising.
how about those pork chops?
we're not selling them.
the ad just says pork chops, mr. korman.
no pictures or id numbers.
so what do you want, miss tremont?
i want these ribs off that price.
all right.
jake.
hey!
jake.
ah... ah
first of all, i'm sorry this business is on you, john, but we have a personnel problem you need to know about.
this guy we're gonna get can't decide between us and goldman.
i know you hate it, but you have to step in and use your magic touch.
is the guy that good?
let's not kidnap this guy
these kids from work school think they're worth $000,000 a week when they work.
i hate your attitude.
okay, set this up with kathy at the end of the week
i got notes for the next day.
the vale project has given us a lot of directions, but management is resisting our suggestions that we provide information to help investors understand why the company is so profitable.
they don't want to give so much information to their compet
i don't know why we have to cooperate with this vale guy.
he's a dark
we're risking the company's reputation.
if we turn him down, we'll never get business from him again
a huge fee is demanding and banking division wants it.
i'm worried about my wife's share this year.
lower your price.
i think that's the earlyest concern that has ever recorded a complaint.
yeah?
your sister's on the line, mr. tremont.
he says it's important.
she needs to talk to you now.
i'm in a
john, this is about our mother.
he had a heart attack
he's okay now, but he'
can you come?
hey!
how was the flight?
good one.
the guy next to me didn't leave me alone.
he heard i was on wall street, so don't ask.
"how are the stock options?
i understand.
have you ever heard of a stock called chetex?
mario.
seriously, someone in the math department told me about it.
they produce heat sensors for low temperatures capsules.
it's gonna be bigger
it won't
no?
no.
good.
at home with your father.
home or the hospital first?
whatever.
let's go to the hospital.
that's what i thought.
how's dad
to be honest, johnny, he's a little shaken up
that's why annie's staying
he doesn't want her to be alone
how's mom?
how serious is he?
he can't admit he actually had a heart attack.
he's lying there because of a heart attack, and he claims he's indigestion.
he blames me.
what do you mean?
he says it was the sausages i made for dinner.
he claims i tried to kill him.
did you?
no jury can blame me, john.
i believe you.
if you're here, i'm pretty sick.
look, mom, that's why you're the best.
in your case, a lot of people wouldn't feel guilty.
how are you?
are you in pain?
i'm alive because of my will.
he'll tell you.
i have the willpower of a woman half my age.
don't throw yourself in the
did you see your father?
yo, i came straight from the airport.
if you see him, don't say anything about a heart attack
just tell me something's wrong with me.
okay?
mom.
listen to me.
just say something's wrong with her.
he'll think i'm sleeping because of my uterus.
okay.
if you have to eat outside, go to mcdonald's or wendy's.
someplace simple.
mom, you shouldn't worry about dad right now.
i think you should think about yourself right now.
you had a heart attack.
i'm not sure i had a heart attack.
that hurts me more like gas pains.
mama, if it was gas pains, they'd give you acid cure.
they wouldn't hook you up to $00 million worth of
did you see the doctor who handled me?
because i don't believe he's a real doctor.
he was wearing tight pants with a big silver belt buckle.
he can't be more than 00 years
they're graduating from medical school nowadays.
john!
god, it's so good to see you.
you came and saw your mother first, huh?
yeah.
how was she looking at you, john, telling the truth
like my mother.
it was like he was gonna drag the serum bottles and get out of there.
i mean, it's just gas pains.
i'm sure she told you that, too
and his will?
like a woman half her age.
you look so modern.
where do you want your bags, sir?
oh, just put it over there.
thank you very much.
no luggage in the living room.
you know the rules.
i take them out to your old bedroom.
is the living room still off-limits?
you're kidding.
this looks exactly like the smithson's.
dad's outside, huh?
yes, in the green house.
what's he doing there?
mario said he took it very hard.
he's scared, john.
he's really scared.
i'm not sure he understands what's going on.
what do you mean?
he saw her, didn't he?
i didn't want to drag him there.
i told him no visitors, and he seemed to understand that.
hi, dad.
hello, john.
good to see you.
you look good.
good to see you too.
i'll stay here a few days.
did you hear what happened to your mother?
how is he?
good.
good.
he asked me to say hello and he said he'd be home soon.
something's wrong with your body, isn't it?
something like that.
it doesn't work well in your old room, you know.
you should use a second blanket.
okay.
while you're here, the most important thing is to make sure everything goes okay.
your mother has a calendar and her life is a really long routine.
and a sugar.
they cut coupons in the morning, make a shopping list.
it's very important
i wrote you a list of pills.
when did he get so bad?
he's only been here a year.
no, you're wrong.
what are you saying?
i was here for christmas.
annie, i need to know that.
okay, i saw him two years ago.
a lot happens in two years.
why didn't you tell me?
i tried to take him to us, but he wasn't comfort
we both work all day.
but he has a garden and a green house here.
he knows the environment.
i can only stay here a few days.
what do we do next?
can't you stay longer?
i have to go to boston.
no way.
we gotta get somebody home.
but we have to find the right person.
my dad's old, john.
yeah.
come on dad, let's hit the head, huh?
johnny.
i can't find my pyjamas.
i don't know where your mother put them.
here.
why don't you wear them, dad?
i will.
you okay?
i miss your mother.
he'll get what he needs.
a good rest.
she'll be home soon.
good night.
good night.
keep the hall lights on.
okay.
sleep well.
i don't eat much in the morning, johnny.
it was good, though.
thanks, dad.
you're cooking a lot, aren't you
not really.
i've been eating out since sara and i divorced.
yeah, she was a nice girl.
still is.
how's billy?
he's in santa cruz.
freshman in college.
she came to visit once.
so you've seen him more than i have.
look at this, johnnie.
it's double coupon day at ralph's.
two cans of tuna are $0.00.
amazing.
how much is a tuna fish in new york?
it's not $0.00, i'll bet
no, i disagree.
no way.
listen, dad, i want to talk to you for a minute about mom.
there's something you need to understand.
my mom's sick
it's not cancer, is it
no, no, it's not cancer.
it kills cancer, you know.
your uncle ben had five surgeries.
nothing was done to him.
i'm telling you, if you have cancer, you should pack your bags.
look, it's not cancer.
a heart attack.
is he gonna be okay
yeah, he's gonna be
but he can't work as hard as he used
he's gonna need to learn to take it slow, and you need to help him with that
i always tell her that you work too hard.
johnny, he works too hard.
you need to learn a few things you can do at home.
look, my mom made you believe no one else could look after you.
we'll try to fix that wrong.
got it, johnny.
i'll learn how to do all this.
you'll see.
we're gonna make fun of her
okay, dad, let's see what we need to do first,
" separate the colored from the whites."
so, dark matter doesn't mix with white colors.
understood.
i think that's what your mother would do.
now we know we're on the right track.
okay, let's start with the colors, okay?
they're col
colored.
white, color, color.
white.
colored.
colored.
and this?
him?
he's white
okay, it's col
dad, it's got to be one
i think we should call your mother.
i'm going to make a transporter here.
okay.
what do you think we got?
"e, normal.
i'm trying "normal."
what kind of water should we use?
"cold-cold, cold-cold, warm, warm-coat, warm-coat."
what the hell is this?
hot-hot.
i think he was white.
she'll be ready for thursday.
yeah.
what's the easiest way to get to the market from here,
i don't really know these streets, john.
your mother will take us where we need to go.
you never drive?
nothing?
i can't
my license expired a few years ago.
you didn't get another driver's license?
well, they wanted me to take a test because of my age.
you failed the test?
i didn't take the test.
i was afraid i wouldn't pass.
what are you saying?
you used a hell of a car.
johnny, a good driver knows when to drive a good car, that's all.
i couldn't remember what you liked, so i took a little bit of everything.
great.
well... well...
these are beautiful.
i want to see your mother, johnny.
i don't think that's a good idea right now, dad
i mean, my mom's fine, but they wouldn't want to accept visitors.
i'm her husband.
i need to see him.
that's not true
excellent.
he made me breakfast this morning.
no, i'm not serious.
i don't know, he set up a box.
yeah.
it's all right.
okay, bye-bye
okay, dad
annie's meeting with the people at the
or he thinks they can let you in a day or two.
good.
yeah.
what?
i can do the dishes.
i coded these cards by color.
here's a different code card for every day-to-day
like, now, the pink ones are for washing dishes.
go ahead, take a look and see the number has escaped.
number one: number
"fill it with water."
okay.
number two?
"uya put some soap on it."
okay.
"put dishes in soap water."
i made these for you to work on your own.
these are great, johnny.
if i follow these cards, there's no reason i should make a mistake.
i'll watch these.
i'll show you how to burn the stove, dad.
no, on the other hand, the heat is off limits for now.
no stove.
and stay away from that blender.
no flapping.
i think i should work with this.
your mom wouldn't want me to wear this.
i look so rude.
like johnny cash.
you don't think that when you put this on, do you?
no, dad, i don't think
don't take your guns into town, son.
leave those guns at home.
bang, bang.
"fill the powder." "
professional floor wax, dad.
you can see yourself on the floor.
no sign of cila saruman.
you know what i think?
i think we should reward ourselves.
what do you mean?
let's go out and have a good time.
what are you saying?
okay.
okay.
what do you and mom do here for fun?
"i" 00. 00 "i
"i" two-zero.
"o" 00. 00.
seven-five.
"b" 00. 00.
"b" one-one.
on top, all right?
"g" 00 "
"g" five-eight.
are you kidding me?
does the air conditioning work here, dad?
or a fan or something?
"i" 00... 00... 00.
choo-choo!
i love when they do that.
do they always?
"b" 0. 0.
and after!
boy, tonight's fun.
"i" 00. 00 "i
bingo!
bingo!
jake tremont, is that you?
hal mccarthy.
how are you?
remember gloria?
my son, john.
she's visiting from new york.
how are you?

no, he's in the hospital
that's good to hear.
give us our best.
we'll tell
thank you.
you heard about nick price, right?
he's dead
oh, yeah.
nick, robin, dorothy, twins.
all of them.
the whole table.
and delores patcher in the next table.
he's
he's dead
well, it's good to see you again.
it's been a while.
a long time.
nice to meet you.
they're like fresh air.
i know his bingos.
haven't you been here long, dad?
when was the last time you played here?
must have been three years
you're kidding.
why did you stop coming?
i don't
we used to have fun with your mom here, more than anybody else, but...
we don't do what we love anymore.
i don't know why.
i think you should remember what you enjoyed and start doing them again.
that's a good idea.
john, i'll write this down.
i'll make a list of the things we enjoy.
yes, sir.
bingo.
what?
i think you did bingo.
hey, i got bingom!
i was worried about you, john.
i'm afraid you'll have an add
we should take a look at this.
we can win and make regular profits.
i know a computer kid in new york, let me consult him.
between numbers are great.
he'll create a system for us.
you'll see.
we're gonna beat these guys, d
i'm sorry, i didn't mean to let you go so late
it's like new year's eve.
the only thing missing is guy lombardo.
he's dead
surprised hal mccarthy didn't mention that.
big day tomorrow.
let's go to bed.
good night, john.
good night, dad.
"b" 0. 0.
and then.
there they are, dad.
hi, dad.
you're kidding me.
ready to see him, dad?
i can't believe my dad looks so good.
is that what you think?
thanks to you, john.
i'm good because of him.
that was fun.
listen, i hired someone to take care of the house.
it's gonna be a couple
i can stay home until my mom gets home.
really?
yeah, that's okay
hey, bette.
you okay?
uh-huh.
you swallowing blood pressure pills?
are you eating?
yeah, i'm fine, bette.
i can make my own bed now.
i wash dishes.
john's teaching me to cook.
she's like a real wife.
just keep her alive until i get back.
thank you for your confidence.
mom looks good, doesn't she?
yeah, great.
i can't go anywhere without my tubes.
i meant the color of your face, mom.
my color?
what are you, a decorator?
don't call me mom.
do i call you son?
don't be so kind to my mom, mario.
you're gonna kill him
why are you cooking?
there was food ready in the fridge.
i told you.
we just wanted a little change, that's all
we had salmon last night.
we had coq au vin at night.
your father doesn't like foreign food.
just chicken in red wine.
he shouldn't drink red wine.
mom, that was it.
i don't want him to turn into an alcoholic while i
no one eats coq au vin is an alcoholic.
easy, bette.
don't worry about everything.
just focus on healing here and don't worry about me.
you sure you want to come, dad?
it's going to be a
no, i will.
sounds good to me.
i can buy you lunch here and watch a movie.
i'll sit down, i'll read a magazine.
i'll be fine.
okay.
john tremont to see vic walton, please.
he's waiting for you.
dad, are you gonna be comfortable here among all these repairs?
sure, nobody's gonna drop anything on me.
john, good to see you.
sorry about the mess.
good to see you too, vic.
this is my dad, jake tremont.
dad, this is vic walton.
nice to meet you, mr. tremont.
me, too.
can we be here in an hour?
like i said.
okay, well, take care, dad.
wait a minute.
we can't leave your father here.
come on, mr. tremont, why don't you come in and sit with us?
i don't think
ralph, we've given you all the privileges, and now our guess is 00% less than yours.
how can you be so confident?
you-you've never followed a job like this before.
and if you're wrong, we're going to be the laughing stock and we're never gonna do business with you again.
forget about running the cannery.
he loses money every minute he's open, but the land he's got is worth at least 00
how can you be so sure of $00 million?
with a little bounty, we can leave it for 00 million
do you have any backup information?
can i get back to the point now?
we don't have a problem with all the transport business around $00 million.
they can take over all over the overhead, but we have a schedule that we need to eliminate control 00% of the executive staff in a few months.
isn't it enough just to sell
that's how you deal with accounting records.
if this goes well, we won't have to.
i don't think they're focusing on
we can change that.
it's about food wholesale sales, and it's a good sector this long.
now, our cash flow plans for our division appear to be aggressive, but not satisfactory.
when we consider everything, we have no problem getting loan from the banks.
yeah, that looks good.
johnny, what's going on out there?
well, we're gonna buy a salmon fishing factory, dad.
i didn't know you had information about this.
actually, i don't know.
the man who came to us for money has no idea.
we're just gonna buy the company and then we're gonna put an end
is this your job?
you buy companies, then close them?
my work is a little complicated, dad.
we're taking this canned factory.
then the company sucks.
this third generation is underway, and it's terrible production.
but there are small fraud companies, and that's the ski business.
the factory is built on a valuable property near the sea.
so we buy the factory, close it, then take over our shell company, then sell the land.
have you ever thought about running these companies?
there's no money in that, dad
the world has changed, johnny.
you can't believe how the world changes.
when you were a little boy, you went to work with me at locheed, remember?
i used to rip out the nuts and touch them.
they'd give me 00 cents a day, and i'd buy those ham-cheese sandwiches
when you grew up, you said you wanted to work there with me.
but what you do now is buy and shut it down.
did you hear about those lockeheed guys, dad?
rick malinson?
tommy williams?
they all moved away.
the valley, palm springs... the palm springs... the valley
there was nobody there to say goodbye to me
next morning, there was no one who did what i did.
the two groups of worlds split
...workers and bosses.
i don't know, dad, i
it's all right, johnny.
there's nothing wrong here.
i'm a worker, that's all.
but you're different.
you like to be in control.
you like responsibility.
you're a boss.
mom?
what do you think?
okay, dad.
"if you hit a parked vehicle and cannot find the owner of the vehicle...
why are you doing this?
i've already passed the written test.
i know, but you may not be too careful.
a lot of the specimens here might be on the driver's test.
i want to prepare you for this.
very good.
thank you.
we've come this far.
i don't want to see anything go wrong now.
they want us to pull over there.
go.
slow, slow, not so fast.
okay, stop.
there he is.
jake tremont?
it's jake tremont, actually.
i'm his son, john.
i guess you didn't need to know that, but you heard.
you can't sit here during the test, sir.
oh, i'm sorry.
oh, you can't stay in the car.
what are you talking about?
this is my father.
that's the rules
i won't test you in the car.
either now, or your father fails the test.
everything okay?
it'll be okay if you
when you leave your car parked in your parked car-
john?
i'm going
i check bicycles and other vehicles.
yes!
while waiting for a turn to the left, give a priority to cars coming out of the square.
make sure all available vehicles go through.
yes!
oh, look who's here.
hey, dad
hey, billy.
hey...
my grandma was sick.
so i ran.
i thought you might need me, grandpa.
don't even think about helping your grandpa.
when was the last time you ate?
why are you americans so obsessed with food?
you know, when in rome...
what were you doing in mexico?
semester break.
some of my friends are there.
dad, you say that every time we meet.
and i haven't grown in two years.
how's your mother
good.
it's the third year in law, top of class
it's embarrassing if your mother's taking more notes than you do, but we work.
send my love.
how are you?
sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
if i know you, you win more than you lose.
if you're done, you should wax it with a piece of cake.
he looks so good.
what's going on?
well, we spend a lot of time together.
pretty good time, huh?
they say this is very good for parents and children.
maybe you and i should spend more time together.
this place looks great, grandpa.
too much.
you look well.
i'll give you a name after that, bill.
butter, anyone?
you want some butter, honey?
i want to make a toast.
aha.
a lot has happened in the last two weeks.
we've overcome some challenges, we've had some pain.
we had them all as a team.
it's time for thanks.
that was great, mario.
that's my usual conversation.
actually, i just wanted to say how nice to see our family together and happy.
my chicken's getting cold.
it's over
very good.
i'm having a toast too.
hmm.
wow, dad.
to my dear bride.
your bride?
have you had a drink today, jake?
before you came, mother, we had a drink of 'coq au vin'.
to my lovely bride...
bette, welcome back to our family, where you belong.
it's so good to be
listen, listen.
nice speech, dad.
it's nice to have everybody here
and i don't remember the last time we were together with john billy.
billy looks good.
i like that earring.
should i wear them too?
i have a needle that wakes up if you want.
oh, leave him alone, mama.
looks great.
i bet the girls are gonna jump on you.
don't worry about me.
that's not embarrassing.
the hostel's a man.
is that true?
yeah, our dorm's kind of a mess.
i'm glad it wasn't like this in
if that were the case, i wouldn't
it's like you're a student to
mario was a great student, mom.
he graduated physics.
he hasn't read, he's out of laps
yeah, but all the good students read the book at the same time as me and ended up with a lick-a-
but john was a good student.
thank you, mommy.
we went out of the nest every friday to the library.
we would buy 0 books.
you read them, we'd give them back, then we'd buy four new books.
you did more than that.
so how did it work?
were the girls on the other floor?
somebody shut him up.
i'm just happy
let's make things easy for grandma and grandpa while you're here.
sure, you're used to hearing it, but you can't believe it's real.
believe me, believe me.
my fillings are still ringing.
i'm sorry.
so when do you have to go back to school?
i'm not going back to school.
i'm thinking of hanging out in mexico for a while.
what's the joke of mexico?
all mexicans try to get here.
did you know that?
there are some kids from school.
there are many different directions.
that's, uh, that'
yeah, it's fun, but believe it or not, you're gonna want to work one day, bill.
lying on the beach in mexico isn't gonna do you any
if you don't want to be a mariachi singer, you have to finish a school no matter what.
i would say i went to college.
i got the phd.
i did the right thing.
two phds.
one chemistry, one physics.
i'll be back in new york soon and i want to make this right.
what does your mother think?
he thinks i can make my own decision.
i'm not sure how i feel about this.
we need to talk more about it.
i don't understand why.
we haven't talked about it until now, and i know what i want.
johnny, something's wrong.
can you come over here and take a look?
that's enough, mr. tremont.
you can get dressed if you want.
is he okay?
yeah, good.
a difficult process is beginning.
it hasn't spread yet
what do you think is the problem?
it could be one of a few things
i suspect there are ranchers in the bladder.
the problem is whether he's good-hearted
will this come out in your tests?
not completely.
it's not a good sign to ble
so it's serious?
i think we should get him through a general operation.
if it was serious, dad, they wouldn't leave you.
they'd open it up and operate under the spots.
i wouldn't be surprised if it was just a
i don't think we should tell mom about this.
why worry if there's nothing out there?
whatever you say, johnny.
you're the boss.
he told you, didn't he?
of course he did.
then you know it's nothing serious.
if it's not serious, you should have told me yourself.
look, mom, you've got to stay away from a possible stress.
you'll be sorry for nothing.
that's why i didn't tell you
he says it's just a cyst.
that's right
it's going to be a simple
yes, it is.
mom, if something went wrong, i'd tell you.
make sure.
okay.
am i gonna walk around here like this, john, like all the nurses here, with my ass open?
yeah.
that's what it says here on the accept
"dress is illegal."
lie down.
you need to sign this, dad.
what is it?
i don't have any baseball gloves.
that was a bad joke.
dr. santana prepared these meds.
it'll just help you relax.
if you have too much, let me have a piece.
they paid extra for the private room.
what time is it
it's evening
it's not late yet?
no.
are you comfortable, dad?
i'm fine.
i'll let you get some rest.
this thing will put you to sleep like a baby.
okay.
remember, if you need anything, just ring that bell.
that's all,
you'll be fine.
you know, john, i see some men, they hug each other.
we never hugged.
shall we give it a try?
come on.
i love you, johnny.
i love you, too, dad.
okay, mr. tremont, i'm afraid
cancer.
we ran into a couple of malignant tumors.
your father wouldn't happen to a
well, it's a silly question, but are you absolutely sure about that?
yeah.
the good thing is we can reach him and destroy him.
listen, dr. santana.
whatever you do, don't tell my dad you have cancer.
he's very agitated and afraid of that word.
say something more reasonable.
calm down, mr. tremont.
you'd be surprised what the others went through.
the kids don't even care about that.
i'm not taking that lightly, doctor.
i just want to tell him myself, that's all.
it's cancer, isn'
mom, i told you.
it's just a cyst and they'll take
i want to see him.
mom!
mom, you can't see him right now.
will you listen to me?
you shouldn't be subjected to this kind of stress.
if everything's okay let me see him.
oh, come on, mom!
john only wants what's best for you.
you know.
you should listen to him, mom.
he's my husband and i'll see him.
either you take me there now, or i walk, but i'm going.
what's there?
billy, go quickly find dr. santana.
come on!
get out of here.
what happened to him?
jake, it's me
why didn't he recognize
jake!
mr. tremont, this is dr. santana.
do you know who i am?
i'm fine.
i'm all right now, thank you.
give me 00 of libium im and check every two hours.
okay, doctor.
this is exactly the same as the other patients.
they often go into shock after simple operations.
that's standard?
do you know what's going on in there?
i know this is a frightening experience for you, but what you need to understand is that this is a state of crisis here.
he wasn't senile when
why now?
senility is a strange thing.
and it goes.
that kind of stress just happens.
i'm sure it'll fix the situation with a good rest and medication.
what do we do in the meantime?
nothing.
what do you mean "nothing"?
we wait for him to answer medication.
did you tell dad he had cancer?
he has the right to know that.
i don't know exactly what you want from me, mr. tremont.
dr ethridge, dr ethridge,
i don't trust santana.
you're the hospital manager, and what i'm trying to say is that it doesn't comfort us.
dr. santana is a fine young surgeon.
she seems to be perfect and professional about your father.
i told him not to tell dad that he had cancer, because he's too afraid of that word.
but what he did, he went right away and told him.
yeah, that's hard for any doctor.
he has to balance the balance with family members and your father's right to gather information.
i'm sure he had no choice.
he had a choice.
he should have listened to me.
i know my father.
why did you tie her arms?
so he wouldn't hurt
he was hitting himself with his hands
well, i'm his son, and i don't think he needs them.
tell us when you're ready, and we'll put him back in bed.
i can't believe this.
hey, dad, how's it
does he always look like that?
look, look, look, look, i brought annie.
and billy's here.
hey, dad
how are you feeling, dad?
can you hear me?
hey, grandpa, it's billy.
how's it going
god, john, i can't stand being here looking at him like this.
i think that's enough.
i gave him a favor.
it'll calm him down.
how long has she been like this?
all the time we've been here.
he seemed depressed?
jesus, doctor.
i'm glad you're not a detect
yeah, he seemed depressed.
what the hell is going on here?
i meant anything unusual, mr. tremont.
mr. tremont- mr.
don't keep telling me it's common, doc.
this unusual depression isn't unusual, it's true, but the sedative will bring him to himself.
sedative?
he's hallucinating.
the guy's always yelling.
he doesn't know any family, and you just gave him a sedative?
why didn't you give him some cake?
maybe his throat hurts too!
we decided to discharge your father tomorrow.
you can pick him up after 00:00.
what do you mean, "purette"?
you want to tell me my dad's getting better?
well, of course not, but medically speaking there's nothing we can do for him.
we can't keep beds for patients who can't help medical care.
how can we know?
he never got medical help!
what exactly do you mean?
that's what i said.
so they don't care if he dies.
what kind of talk is that?
i didn't think--
just calm down.
you want my dad out of here?
look what i'll do.
i'll do better than you can.
i understand you can't take care of him.
john, what are you doing?
mr. tremont- don't touch him.
that's not necessary.
i'm saying i'll take her home.
mr. tremont, what you're doing is so inexplic
what do we do now?
i don't
we don't have much choice but we-
no, i don't want to do that
i don't want to take her to a nursing
neither do i, john, but we have to do something.
wait a second, john.
you can't help him in this situation.
i think i can do that.
i'll do better than the hospital can.
i'll stay and help.
no.
why not?
i'll take care of him.
he's my father.
well, he's my grandfather.
i'm your father.
i don't want you here right now, billy.
you shouldn't see this.
dad, i'm not a child
look, i think you should go.
go back to school, go back to mexico.
you're in the way.
don't you get it?
yeah, i got it.
i want to talk to him.
i don't think that's such a good idea now, mom, really.
annie's right, mom.
here's to the hearse.
you'd like that, wouldn't you, mario
i meant "get in the car," mom.
it was just a slip of tongue.
he'll be fine.
john will take care of her.
let's go, dad.
this gooden kid is awesome, isn't he
the style reminds me of bob gibson.
you know, a real player.
did you get it, dad?
good.
here we go.
the shaft.
we're gonna have to work on your technique.
okay.
what you need is a little home-cooked meal.
well, i think he's right.
wait till you taste this.
come on, dad.
okay.
hmm, okay.
here.
try this.
come on, dad, take a bite.
come on, there you go.
let's take our chances.
dad, don't bite the glass.
house rules.
you don't like it there, do you?
neither did i.
we're gonna be okay, huh
come on, dad.
that's better.
okay, dad
hold on a minute and i'll put you to bed.
i'll just get these in.
why are we here, ed?
why aren't we at the ranch
what?
you know, they'll wonder if we stay, you know.
where's the land
it's your house, dad.
what are you talking about?
mandy didn't come back from the meadow,
i'm worried about him.
well, don't worry, dad
i-i'm sure he's okay.
you think so?
yeah.
i need 00 nails for the henhouse, give me a hand.
it has to be done
look.
what we need now is a good night's sleep.
you always say when there's a problem:
"let's lay down on it."
i mean, we have problems right now, dad.
let's sleep on it.
dad?
dad?
dad?
dad, where are you?
dad?
dad?
dad?
dad?
what the hell are you doing here?
oh, dad, come on, let me help you.
come on, dad, come on.
no.
dad, i'm gonna lift
come on out.
come on, dad, get out
dad, come on.
i got you.
shh.
come on.
shh.
i got you, i got you.
i got you.
mr. tremont?
i understand you brought your father back to the hospital.
yeah.
i thought it would be hard for you to look at him at home.
that's not a good place for him right now.
he can't do it at home, he can't do it here,
maybe he should take a helicopter to the top and stop.
i know it's hard for kids to accept that their parents are old.
what that means.
i know what it's like to grow old
mr. tremont, you must remember that doctors are human.
we can't handle all the problems.
we can't save every patient.
we live in a system where old people eventually become hard.
what is it you want?
why are you here?
there's another doctor in this hospital.
i think he can do better than dr. santana.
what?
i repeat everything that is said.
he's a good man.
i want him to take a look at your father.
mr. tremont?
mr. tremont?
how are you, mr. tremont?
let's do a few tests.
let's get an eeg and identify his metabolic disorder.
give us calcium-magneticium and run vital functions.
i'm not sure what caused it, but right now my diagnosis is an epileptic.
the question is, what caused it?
and why is she unaware?
if you want to have other consultations about this, please do.
no, that won't be necessary.
well, like we said, don't sit in our seats and think we're not gonna do anything.
we don't think so.
we've run a series of tests so far and we'll do more.
so far, all we've done is shoot darkness.
i appreciate your modesty, doctor.
but those tests were done a long time ago, right?
he's gonna lie here for a while, so we're gonna watch him from the monitor every minute.
and i'll check and visit him twice a day.
i'm not leaving the beginning until he gets better.
i'm afraid that's completely against hospital regulations.
how long can you hold on to that?
i don't
i go once a day.
i'm sitting.
i'm talking to him
i'm coming over and talking to
i think if i sit there and talk, he won't die.
what will you do if he dies?
annie, i don't-
you're the only one who can't accept it, john
why don't you let him go?
i can't explain it to you.
maybe i should be there when his end.
i don't
to prove he's still here.
to prove i was his son.
so, what have you done positive so far?
annie, this guy's gone to work in his life that he never loved.
we never asked him.
he did it because he was the father and he had no choice.
he never asked himself if i was happy or unhappy.
he didn't even know if he had the right
we have to take care of him and take care of him when he's older than this election.
but i messed it up.
john.
i'm ashamed of him, but my mother took over him.
she's getting old right now.
i'm embarrassed because i have a marriage that goes bad, a job that doesn't make sense, and i have a son who would barely recognize it if i saw it on the street.
maybe this is gonna be hard for me
but i'll be there when you die.
and i'm gonna kiss him, and i'm gonna cover him, and i'm
and i'll draw the moment i'm there.
i owe him that.
when did you get to town?
never been.
i'm staying with some friends.
i didn't want to leave my grandfather.
have you been here every day?
when you leave, a nurse calls me.
i'm standing about half an hour.
where am i, johnny?
you're in the hospital, d
i understand that.
why are you here?
was there an earthquake or a car crash?
is he talking?
yes, he does.
he's learning like a child.
go, report this to dr. chad.
please, please.
why did she look at me so pretty
uh, he's-he's in the hospital,
well, she's a nurse.
this is molly, this is cecey, uh, this is annie.
this is my father.
okay, mr. tremont.
how can we make you comfortable?
you can start by getting these pipes off me.
i'd better eat something later.
are you going to starve me here?
okay, first, we need to take it slow.
remember, you haven't eaten for a long time.
maybe that's why i'm like this
have you thought about it?
all tests positive, vitals stable.
this is a healthy human profile.
i've seen people coming out of a coma before.
we don't usually find out why.
i have some theories about this.
not now.
like what?
somehow we gave him the enzymes that his brain didn't produce in the serum mixture, and we're lucky to do that.
i understand.
you know, when we get home, we say it was all that.
but in return, it was your love and interest that brought your father back from where he went.
i think it's better this way.
me, too.
they're here
what's going on, dad?
what are you looking for?
your mother and i are starting a new life together, johnny.
we need new clothes.
i don't know, d
what do you think my mom would say about all
she'll probably laugh and call me crazy, but she'll laugh.
we've had laughs at home for ten years.
how about that?
thank you.
thank you, thank you.
ladies, ladies, our show is on.
no matter how high you get during your performance, please stay in your shoes.
the house is proud of presenting the number one star of our show, the victim, the late and almost funeral man has returned from a successful tour of the shipments,
great, jake.
i'd like to give him a big round of applause
come on, give it a big round of applause
moving on.
and his plague friend, billy!
ladies and gentlemen, billy!
this is my outfit for riding a bicycle on the beach in venice.
maybe he was skating.
this is my baseball-wearing outfit.
see?
i think i'll wear it more at home.
actually, i could go see a couple of games, but not in these clothes.
that's good to hear, jake.
wait.
there's another one.
do it again.
oh, i peed my pants!
stop them!
i'm dying
i never heard of anyone dying from laughing, bette
but wouldn't that be nice
i'm telling you, johnny, he's not the same.
maybe his hormones got mixed up with someone else's.
you know what happens in hospitals.
nobody's gonna believe he's a 00-year-old, who's about to
you need to talk to someone, i'm serious.
mom, he's just having fun.
we played a single stroke, but still...
perfect day.
can you take us somewhere after breakfast?
that's a good idea.
maybe mom will come with us.
i'm not driving that car.
it would take a lot faster before.
i hate to think about what he loves right now.
don't worry about your pretty little head, bette.
when old jake tremont is behind the wheel, you'll be safer in your own bed.
and this is gonna be so much fun
what are you doing on the floor?
nothing.
i want to see if i can still do pushups.
i call it "old man pushup."
what are you gonna do, bette?
are you coming to the beach?
i'm coming, but only with a taxi.
i don't want to take a taxi.
i think we'll sail in santa monica.
that's old people's paradise.
every corner either a practice or a bank.
i want to ride to venice.
oh, i used to love fishing.
where are my fishing gear?
i think i put them somewhere in the garage.
that was 00 years ago.
i'll go get them.
he'll be fine
johnny, i'm scared.
he's talking about people i don't even know, or people i'm sure are dead.
he says we live on a farm in cape may, new jersey, and he's taking us there because it's harvest time.
what?
dad.
he told you, huh?
what's going on?
can you drive me around?
john, i need to talk.
johnny, johnny,
...what are my chances of living on a farm with your mother and four kids in new jersey cape may?
i don't think you have a chance, d
isn't there any chance he could be on a little farm there?
don't i have four kids there?
you, annie, hank and little lizbeth?
as far as i know, dad, you've been living in los angeles for 00 years.
you had a regular job until you retired from locheed.
before that, we lived in plainfield and you worked for lockeheed there.
i know you're right.
i mean, how can you be in two places at once?
i mean, my life there's like this one here, like this, right here, right
i just sit and watch the ocean.
stop me if this is too technical or too fantastic.
your father, as laing rec described, is a successful schizophrenic.
over the years, he's not getting enough pleasure out of his everyday life, and he's isolated things into a dream.
he's created more life than he wanted.
how long has this been going on?
it's hard to say now.
at least 00 years, maybe more.
unbelievable.
understand this, you have to have an extremely intelligent, strong-willed, emotional personality to do this.
and where's my mother's in all this?
he was thrown out of these?
you're frozen in time.
your mother is very helpful, very sweet.
isn't that the most important thing in the world
he has influence.
the problem is, the place your father was found in this world depends on your
since he's regenerated, he's been a happy
the walls dividing his two worlds have broken down.
and he brought the fun he's kept from his life for years into his journal.
if your mother doesn't join him, she'll just disappear and leave.
hello, all the beautiful people here.
maybe i'll do some jogging on the bike
what do people think if they see you like this?
who cares?
i don't want people calling us old fools.
and don't care what people think anymore.
just ignore some young people looking at what we're wearing.
i'm coming with you, dad.
good boy, good boy.
don't worry about me
i'm gonna go to newark and get some things for the farm.
hey, mom, i told you what the doctor said.
you need to help him now.
that kind of comment won't solve anything.
the man lives in another time zone.
you have to show him that.
that's all
i explained to you, it's just a dream.
a beautiful and wonderful dream world.
dad's learning how to separate the two worlds right now.
he's trying.
i don't care what you say.
something happened to him.
this man is not your father.
i think that's the real jake tremont.
the guy's been hiding it for 00
hello.
i'm jake tremont, this is bette tremont.
we're your neighbors across the street.
sure.
how can i help you?
okay.
this is christopher.
how's it going, young man?
and say hello to mr. tremont, chris.
hello.
hello.
if you ever need someone to look after a child, we're always home.
oh, that's very kind of you
thank you.
no, no, no, it's a lying dog.
that's him.
like a lying dog.
yeah.
yeah, he's... he's too
go... go...
maybe we- may
we wanted to say hello.
we brought you some cake.
come in.
maybe he's just sitting outside.
did you hear any strange noises last night?
why, did you hear?
i think i heard something.
i think it should be the wind.
close the door." shut the door
they'll come with the wind.
how's it going with dad?
the doctor thinks it's a fix-up
he tries to get into my bed at night.
he won't leave me alone.
your father was always a sexist, but since he came back from new jersey, he's been crazy.
when we first got married, i told my friend fanny hogan the things we did with your father, and he told me to leave him and notify the police.
when i confessed with the priest, he said he would pray for me.
but it didn't work.
you know, when your father's been warned, police, priests, prayers, nothing can stop him.
oh, grow up.
"i'm a small, short, fat little teapot of me
"here's my pervert, my mouth."
"when the heat comes out"
"you'll hear me shake."
"take me down and spill my guts!"
oh, bingo.
here.
you know, i realized something.
we don't speak japanese.
you just realized that?
we should try to know a new country once a week.
we should just eat the food of that country and speak the language of that country.
we have to do this.
no, we shouldn't.
"where's the train station?"
"where's the train station?"
what are you doing?
i'm trying to find the train station.
i think that's a good idea
it's working.
i feel like japan.
oh, yes, annie, give us some samples, please.
clothes, huh?
"the japanese women's clothing...
"is different than men.
"there are some local women in the region like their husbands
"fants and trainers.
"this is someone new there,
"it forces men to recognise the sexes from which their beard is also uninhabitable."
i don't know about you, but i don't want to be in a country where i can't isolate people's
i'm serious.
this happened to me in a bar once.
john, john, tell us about agriculture.
in this country of mountains, only 00% of the ball can be processed."
pass the rice, please.
if you say that in japanese.
"please pass the bat, please."
you're welcome.
come on, mom.
you gotta deal with it.
no.
no.
no.
billy, you-you go ahead.
traditional japanese sports.
what have you got for us?
"umo wrestler, sumo suit...
"before a fight they must reach 000 pounds of heavy weight."
that's a big idea.
get him as fat as you can, then get him in a diaper.
john, don't you think these guys are interesting?
mario, i'm starting to worry about you.
honey, please... me...
wait a minute.
pass, pass, pass, pass...
what do you want?
what about fish?
do you want it?
here.
no, i don't want to, jake
i don't eat that.
i don't want to know japanese.
i don't want to know the neighbors
mama, please shut...
i wanted him to walk, but now i know what i have.
but since he came back from the hospital, this place has been a madhouse.
costumes, jogging, hours of sex.
and a farm in new jersey!
i'm telling you, this man can't even be left alone on the street
dad's really good.
he just wants to have fun!
i didn't live my life to end this way!
a crazy man like my old friend!
you know that better.
the doctor said he wasn't crazy
the truth is, he's been under your raid for 00 years!
oh, come on.
please don't.
don't say that to your mother.
please.
we're family.
let's trust each other.
let's love each other and forget.
and please don't fight.
your conversation is killing me.
why?
why are you doing this?
you're gonna make him old again.
this can't be what you want.
i want my husband back.
he wants his life back.
she loved you for 00 years.
can't you leave him alone?
i'm scared, jake.
i don't understand who you are.
i don't recognize you.
i know.
look at me or... see the old man somebody else saw.
but inside, thank god, bette, i feel 00.
and that's how i act, i guess.
your other life, jake, it hurts.
what's so bad for me?
we crossed the border a bit.
a little.
are you asking me to go back to our old life?
oh, no.
i'm asking you to go back to the life we want.
you were so good.
not just to me, to the world
we used to have a good time, remember?
we used to dance all the time.
you were such a good dancer.
and i wanted to dance with you one last time before i died.
don't talk about death.
dying is not a sin.
so is life.
morning, mom.
morning.
nice outfit
your father likes it.
mr. tremont?
i have some news.
not too good.
what is it?
well, it's not the same in every case, but it looks, uh...
okay, good doctor, you can tell me the truth.
the cancer's back
it's spread
it's in the lymph glands
how much?
it's hard to say.
every patient looks different.
dr. chad?
i don't
hey, dad, what are you doing at this hour?
i'm waiting for you.
why?
you understand your mother and i divorced too young to be home late.
i feel i've lost my sensation as a father to my son.
you want me to go out and come back again?
no, just sit down and talk.
what would you like to talk about?
i'll try to tell you something.
i want to give you some advice as your father.
some visions.
i can't think of anything.
it might be hard for someone my age to understand.
you know, every time we see each other, we're always on the move.
you go, or i come, or we're at someone's wedding.
all we talk about is the suitcases, bags or little sandwiches we can eat.
i don't know much about you.
well, uh, look, i'm 0'0",
i like sports, i like bikes-
you know, we always do the same thing.
we come around, one... one of us has a joke to say something real.
talk to me.
tell me about mexico.
i love it there.
oh, there people are intimate and understanding.
well, life goes by in a rhythm there.
you got a lot of friends there?
yes, there are five of us.
you know, we hang out as a group.
we work together.
we share everything we do.
we share cleaning, homework.
we're a real family.
other guys from school?
well, two of them are girls.
life has changed, billy.
it's hard to believe that life has changed.
why does the money come before me and your mother?
oh.
you said you wanted to talk.
okay.
because, uh, this is about what a man was.
some father wears a suit and makes good money.
okay, that's the easy one
because i love the power of it.
it's nice to be the one who's good at the job, the one who's running
and something had to be given, this was my family.
well, i never did that.
i never got away from my family.
running was the hardest thing for me.
that's not what it looked like
i mean, because we wanted to be normal.
that's what the books say.
"normal" divorce.
but it hurt.
a little.
it still hurts.
i miss you, billy.
and you never needed me around you.
but i like staying in your life.
i'm your father.
i have a word for you.
someone i feel i owe something.
so what is it?
forgiveness.
he slept a little.
were you here all afternoon?
he feels better when i'm here.
let's go down and get something to eat.
the doctor will be here shortly.
i don't want to kidn
i'll catch up with you.
come on.
where's mom?
she went down with billy to eat.
oh, good.
how are you feeling?
excellent.
i can tell.
you know what i think?
what?
0000 yankees-dodgers games.
what?
i try, but all i can think of are old games and old knees.
bonanza.
oh, that's great, dad.
what about the 0000 yankees-dodgers games?
who took it?
this is the biggest event in baseball history.
the yankee field is joe dimaggio, the prince of players, the star of players, and the dodger left field player, the dodger left-fanger, the
alionfriddo, a second-stringer.
he's just a left wing player
carl furillo, played because he was crippled.
you know this story?
tell me.
well, in the sixth game, it was 0-0 dodgers leading in the time of the strike.
two in, two out.
dimaggio has the ball.
he threw the ball into the heart of the left wing, the most famous runner history ever wrote.
everyone there knew that.
but that little man gionfriddo showed up.
he ran after the ball.
but he couldn't tell if joe dimaggio shot him.
at the last moment, he jumped.
he lived forever.
but the main event has come.
dimaggio began his second tour run, then saw gionfriddo catch the ball.
he got really down, kicked the mud.
you like this?
this man who never showed any emotion, he was a man of the end.
it was al gionfriddo who uncovered his feelings.
you know what that means to me?
what is it?
in america, anything is possible if you do your job well.
sometimes i wish i was more interested in you when you were a kid.
i'd like to kiss you more.
you did it, dad, you did it.
do you know how much i love you?
yeah.
a lot has happened, johnny.
sometimes good, sometimes bad.
honey, i'm putting these in the car.
okay.
did you talk to mom?
mom will stay here for now.
until next month.
we'll see about that later.
okay.
i think he's gonna be
how you holding up?
i miss him.
yeah, me too.
go ahead, i'll catch up with you.
one moment, please.
you go.
hmm... h
grandpa, before you go, we just wanted to say goodbye.
well, we decided this is the right place to do it.
because there's so much of you here.
you have something that lives and grows.
when i think about you...
that was fun.
yeah.
grandpa, i love you and i will always miss you.
my father and i are here together.
that's good.
that's a good idea.
i feel better.
me, too.
tobacco and they say it's a mixture of black trash that invites the demons.
he looked at me like he was trying to expose a mystery.
the turk came to florence.
but from this year's political events, it's not going to be the same classless parade.
we'll pay you half now, half when the traditional trade rules are closed.
tell me, is there anything else you're afraid of
please don't help their efforts.
but the truth is, i've designed a more ambitious series of devices that i know that your idol may be interested in.
speaking of material, a two-headed ice capper died on zitto's farm.
the last cadaver you brought was rotting when i opened it with a knife.
a card can show fate not only a person's nature.
this represents sacrifice.
i should introduce myself as a military engineer, not a painter.
why aren't night guards comforting that man?
the man's sword was so loose and now he finds himself looking at this beautiful sword.
because if you'd asked people, they would say i've been able to use both my hands very well and very easily strugg very well with both my two hands... and also
you've made a very serious mistake tonight, artis
but i'm staying at the guest house of the black swan.
come and see me before i go, master.
what did he give you?
the same ass, very different faces, and when i realized that, i got a sip of his tit.
i'm not gonna let you darken our family name with your flippant moves and your simple attempts to sell yourself.
no matter how much i try to deny you our reputation depends on each other.
my wife, margherita had given me a boy last week.
my legal heir.
i wonder how long it's gonna take him to curse his bloodline.
you're a good man.
by men who knew how to shoot.
this is what you did, leonardo.
they execute a jew today.
she's definitely a charming woman, but i'd rather get that dentist witch to bed.
please give me something to drink from the memory fountain.
depends what's in it.
history is a lie made into weapons by people who suppress the truth.
centuries from now, your story will also be suppressed.
have you ever heard of the term "life is like a river"?
the most unpredictable thing is that the river is circulation.
one person's death opens the birth door of another
i saw a man executed today.
please give me something to drink from the memory fountain.
this temple was a place of worship for a religious belief before christ.
we are known as the sons of mithra.
what many of you have once said is a reminder of what was forgotten.
recently, some clues have shown their location in the book.
when avrah ben yusuf was captured and sent to death, he followed those clues.
maybe you heard of the secret archives the vatican collected.
the head man is a man named lupo merc
i still don't understand what this has to do with me.
taken from constantinople against her will.
do you remember when you were a child that happened?
i was a kid in vinci.
i was sent to get the lost lamb.
what am i supposed to do until then?
fate has chosen you, leonardo.
i don't believe in fate.
then believe in yourself.
so where do i start looking?
hangman, deep in the spirit.
he's already opened the door for you.
and my mother?
he'll be waiting for you on the other side.
all you have to do is walk through the door.
master!
we've been looking for you since last night.
it's been empty for centuries, leo.
master, the night guard were looking for you.
they said lorenzo medici himself wanted you.
leonardo di ser piero...
they said it was my notary's son.
and it was also said that you were incapable of making trouble, arrogant, unconventional, keeping your own ideas to yourself.
arrogance means i exaggerate my own worth.
my mistress, lucrezia, apparently, thinks you have an unauthorized talent in the portrait sketch
he insisted that only you could picture his beauty.
he must be very careful then.
it's called a character flaw.
you have to be smart enough to finish this.
when it comes to miss donati, boredom is the last thing i fear.
i'll tell your father to get a contract ready.
i have some designs i think you might be interested in.
this will increase your gunner's ignition rate most.
when the upper half is fired, the piece of it will be filled with balls and the rest can cool off.
the balls are lined up in a air conditioning--
propulsion will be two men inside.
they're gonna control the maniva, which is how they can spin the wheels.
the balls can be placed around the vehicle.
it's a flying machine.
it's modeled from the added wings of a bat.
they were born with wings, yes.
i believe that humans can fly and that god has blessed us with minds that can imagine.
anything that can be imagined can finally be done.
whoever said otherwise is a fool.
what exactly are you suggesting?
i hope to be hired as an army engineer.
i'm an expert, da vinci.
i had nothing to do with making war.
rome too.
the way they need to, the government's alliance with the
sforza's death was the end of the game board.
you need your own weapons, sir.
i'll give you a modest salary.
your mechanism can be realized to see what these are.
shall we say 000 florins?
i'll cut your tongue if you haggle more.
as you say, sir.
thank you.
you used lucrezia to get to me, didn't you?
i would benefit from anything i could to achieve my goals.
it's clever, but i suggest you not be too clever around me.
is something wrong?
no, sir.
florence has no secrets.
what evil did you do this time?
he played with a woman's pride
then get back to work.
we have a colombina to do!
i want you to remove the body of the jew that was hanged
i need to examine it.
is that my advantage?
depends on the body's restraint
i'll get to work then.
the pazzi family is coming.
along with francesco and old man jacopo.
as is our right.
our ancestor was given to us for his actions during the first crus
colombina's about to fly.
welcome, all of you, to god's house.
the flames of the phoenix suit you well.
tell me the truth, have you always been so desirable with prostitutes you sleep with?
you're not a whore, lady.
there's no reason for us to continue this game, miss donati.
i knew it was you from the first moment you approached me.
how did you know?
i drew you.
your faces, your positions, your movements.
the more remarkable question is why a noble woman would risk her reputation for a degenerate artist.
isn't that the whole carnival thing?
tell me what it is.
so you knew i'd call you.
lorenzo really liked his designs.
can i see some of your miracles?
what is this?
it's a device to slow one's down rate.
and under what circumstances would i use it?
let's say you're stuck in a castle.
you can relieve it and fly safely to freedom.
thank god.
lorenzo's interest in you clearly is right.
you risked more.
maybe his life.
what are you bound by my reckless attitude?
i'm forbidden fruit... and think of your fate as well.
you're the third person this week to tell me something about fate.
maybe you just started to hear the ones.
now... now
fuck me again, leonardo.
this time, remember, you're not the only one who can manipulate.
we can't let you in the front door for obvious reasons.
how rude of me.
i promised to pay first.
i take you satisfied?
start talking, then.
there's a new player on stage
an artist known as leonardo da vinci.
the medicis hired him to build siege weapons.
artists are the clowns of families.
i don't see why that would concern us.
this artist is different.
my spy in florence.
if i'm not mistaken, you are lupo mercuri
head of the secret archives.
looks like turk found himself a new champion.
keep watching him.
see if he's cooperating.
what if he's not?
then da vinci will burn in hell.
with the other enemies of god.
don't make it
yeah, you too.
on a good defense, you gotta be on the line of offense.
when the bad guy comes on you, you cross the line and create a new line.
until he grows old or until you save me?
angel, i didn't ask you to teach me how to punch
i want to learn to fight.
you don't believe i'm gonna do
men aren't always around to protect the women.
besides, what if you were the man i had to fight?
this could be it.
okay.
force the man to fight and he'll improve his own speed.
cordelia, using a deadly weapon is a little different than shaking a ponder.
ready!
okay!
you're on the
lilah.
i was keeping billy company.
thank you so much, gavin.
i'll take it from here.
he felt trapped.
gavin, why don't you go get busy making deals?
you don't want to wake up in such a horrible place again, do you
nobody wants that.
congressman.
i hope you've stayed out of trouble this time.
let's go home.
this is the second time you brought our niece back to us.
our pleasure.
"our pleasure" means he had nothing to do with it.
good boy.
by the way, get out.
why don't you try listening for once instead of getting that big mouth open all the time?
you weren't captain of the debate team, were you?
at least lindsey...
the attempt you gave angel to train you, the responsibility you took.
i'm proud of you.
never hurts to be ready.
if you think he can help you fight, why not?
i was kidding.
wesley, if you want to get to know fred better maybe next time you have the chance to suggest a sincere dinner you don't want us to come to.
i mean, i
is it that obvious?
i don't think the others realize
still, the last thing any of us should do is to be together.
office love, even under normal circumstances...
we don't live under normal circumstances.
what are the odds of us finding someone who can deal with what we have to deal with out there?
i don't know, maybe we should think...
with each other?
i was actually gonna say be alone.
wesley, tell her if you like her.
this murder happened a week ago.
why are they showing me this now?
how did you get these?
did the police sell you these?
if the victim is usually important, they sell it.
she said she wasn't listening to
he was trying to get her to shut up.
actually, it worked.
00:00, check who was there 00 minutes before the crime occurred.
what?
okay, she's n
and who is he?
are you sure it was him?
when you remove one of the size of hell, you remember his face.
yeah, that's him.
now we know why the powers showed me the woman's death.
she died because of me.
angel, if he's somehow responsible, then so am i.
angel... angel
hey.
whatever's going on right now, you're not responsible for it, and i'm not
but i know who you are.
you seem a little nervous, lilah.
long day at the office.
it was brought to my
i was gonna do it.
i know, don't do some of his powers
billy never touched me, and you can't touch him.
this family is the most important family in the country.
they own half the east coast.
the law doesn't do anything to them.
it's not like you chopping up some monsters.
stay away from my client.
i don't think it would be good to ring the bell
how about you dress up like the security guards to sneak in?
all right, you want to be next?
i think we wait here.
why doesn't it surprise me that i can go in without an invitation?
as far as i know, you have a permanent invitation.
i never hurt a woman in my whole life.
i just like to watch.
you're going back.
really?
you're looking for me.
we're taking you in for questioning.
sanchez, read him his rights.
who are you?
nobody.
i'll tell you my problem, i've got a woman who never listens.
yeah, giving up $00 million of fortune and running to a prison cell.
yes, but for how long?
if there's nothing wrong with a cube burning in an impenetrable cube of hellfire in a very well-protected demon dimension, my guess is a simple obstacle.
angel, what are you going to do?
you can't just walk into a police station and play terminator.
there's been an
he can tell us what billy did to her partner before he attacked her.
it's not a bad idea for one of us to wait while we visit a patient in the hospital.
that's part of the blood in the car
not human.
he came through here.
i'll take a sample to the hotel, see what kind of creature billy is.
i'll take care of a foot job.
normal, everyday errand.
cordelia.
i don't think you should do this.
how could i not?
i managed to get a sample of billy's blood.
maybe we can determine what demon line it is, and we can determine how its power works.
could you pass me the glass slides?
thank you.
will you invite me in?
please, come in.
i want you to tell me about billy.
tell angel everything you didn't tell him.
what makes you think i'll do that?
your face before all.
i'll know as soon as it's repaired
i don't switch sides with challenges
angel feels responsible for this kid because he brought him back from hell.
i feel responsible, too, because he did it to save me.
you're actually responsible for this, and you feel nothing because you're a dirty bitch.
he's widened the he
pink is not fashion this spring.
billy blim makes people crazy.
then why didn't he impress angel?
others can take hours.
god, i hope angel isn't starting to feel nervous.
you really haven't.
i have to find billy.
and i'll help you, why?
remember the man you hired to get into my visions?
you know what he did to me, what he looked like?
i was cut, torn up, my face disfigured, burning in pain... or worse till i died.
this is about urgency.
certainly nothing you can do to stop it.
it can be destroyed by someone else for all of a sudden.
and a woman with enough strength would never bear to wear an immoral slut.
where's billy?
i'm a 00-year cab driver, and i understand why you did it.
there's a reason, am i right?
how many times do you want to talk to your clients with fists?
surprised you?
he probably sat back and told her how to drive.
you know the type.
he probably deserved it.
like i said...
dylan, your cousin's here
hey, dylan.
billy.
i didn't know you were having a party
i thought we agreed you weren't coming here anymore after what happened.
do you want me to do it or do you?
some of the red blood cells seem to be overwhelming.
these are probably showing billy came from the demon line.
so billy's power to drive people crazy seems to be in his blood.
which means it could happen in sweat or spit or even touch.
speaking of saliva, where is cordelia?
you knew he was going out because you talked to him.
well, i thought i was...
if you lie to me again, there's gonna be a serious
sit down, fred.
there's something we need to talk about.
i'm sorry i didn't tell you cordelia was gone.
we still have to make some changes around here.
change can be good, i think.
it's like not wearing provocative clothes anymore.
provocative?
maybe your mom and dad never told you what a grown man is going after.
you can't just come in here and wave in my face all the
you're really pushing me to get it.
is that what you want?
stop it.
are we standing now?
you put your hair back there, blink your eyes, and then when we turn around, you laugh at us.
do you think you can do anything you want because you're committed to life?
no.
i'll show you the blood.
what can you tell a woman with two black eyes?
nothing you already said twice.
no sense of humor.
to be honest, i'm calling to kill that bastard.
come in.
you have to know the rules about billy.
everyone in the family knows the rules.
don't leave your girl alone with her, keep her pet away from her and never let her touch you.
when you ask for money, leave it on the table and
can you explain something to me?
why did you invite me in after you said i wanted to kill your cousin?
you're angel, right?
did billy mention me?
angel said an overly emotional person named angel would be late.
the melody is exaggerated... the melody
fred.
i know what you're doing.
who you are.
you're pulling me.
you're forcing me to find you.
it's like a cat-fat game
you've got me tricked into girls' ways.
but you never give up, do you?
no, you keep laughing and running.
guess my love, i'm not one of the new beginnings.
i'm a man.
you can't show up, can you?
no, you hide.
you cheat.
and you, snake, plot behind us.
"here, honey, eat this.
it's just an apple."
the problem is your sex.
why are you making me do this?
do i know you?
i thought we should meet.
i'm the woman wolfram and hart tortured to get you out of your cell.
i understand.
poor, helpless, oppressed woman needs to throw all the injustice that's done to her.
no, asshole.
i'm here to send you back.
i mean, of course you women are who sell themselves for money and prestige, but men are just as bad.
maybe even worse.
they volunteer to spend their careers, their families, even their lives under your skirt.
i'm wearing pants.
in fact, i have an arrow engaged to the jugular.
and it's a coincidence that i use a penis-shaped
i don't think
you don't have the guts to do this
you were wrong again.
he can't hurt me
no, i won't hurt him.
i won't hurt her at all.
over here.
i can tell you that billy was examining the blood from his handprint.
so the handprint on the fingerprint tracking device is billy's blood?
so you're telling me wes turned into a psycho killer because of the handprint i'm looking at?
it worries me when you put it that way.
i'd better get out of here
lock the door behind me.
maybe we should go with plan b.
jesus.
you said we should apply plan b, but what's plan b?
plan b... plan
plan b... plan
plan b, if you don't stop whacking... you're gonna pun
jesus.
cordy, get out of here.
all that rage, all the hatred, all the hatred, to go up to the surface.
please go.
i can't
that's my problem, too.
you think that's your problem?
you know what your real problem is?
men like that!
because your strength doesn't impress me.
charles, you're scaring me.
take this and knock me down.
you want me to hit you?
yes!
i can't
you can.
hit me!
charles, please.
"charles, please." fine.
you'll pay for this.
would you like to hear my theory, fred?
about how stupid you are.
after five years of living in a cave, i believe you will instinctively retreat to small, dark places rather than run outside to be safe.
let's get this over with.
i'm sorry, wesley.
are you sorry?
you were right about me loving dark places to hide.
but you forgot i also like to improve things.
neither do i.
i mean, you're a man, but why didn't billy's touch affect you?
maybe it's because i'm not
and a vampire can never turn into a monster.
you know that stuff billy brought out in other people?
it was always for pain and pleasure.
i suppose you could say your evil side makes you less important than humans.
like a noble person.
i mean, being inclined to evil is really uncomfortable
strange.
what is it?
i'm getting used to fighting outside and relaxing at the same time.
i understand that.
wesley, it's me, fred
does it hurt?
i left you a lot of messages.
i'm so sorry.
wesley, you have to go back to work.
how can you not?
but it's time to go back.
fred.
something inside me was forced to surface.
god, no.
it wasn't something inside, wesley.
it was something you did.
i don't know what kind of man i am anymore.
i know.
you're a good man.
will i see you back at the office?
yeah.
good.
why risk everything to escape tender arms?
tomorrow we march with crixus to rome.
but i want you to go with spartacus.
we're gonna have one bunny?
bring the torch here!
his orders are known by a bull.
and the eagle.
the mark of gnaeus pompeius magnus.
i thought pompey hit the renegade with the renegade bear.
if pompey's scouts return to the republic, he and his legions will follow their trail.
let me know if you see any movement on the side.
then we must support the ghost and provide the flesh with the bone to see light days.
was the end as he always dreamed?
the days after we parted were filled with victory.
the blood of our enemy turning the roads into red soil, filled with dead bodies.
same fate as crixus?
to show spartacus the end of his life.
crassus tempts to drive you silly.
if i was only responsible for my own life, maybe i'd be trapped.
his scouts were heading south towards crassus' legions.
order apollo to leave the camp at the speed of the sky.
a whore named canthara was beaten and found stabbed from his womb to his throat.
i'm surprised by the offer.
i don't know that pompey is supportive of a case that doesn't get
if he had such desire, why didn't he do it himself?
i will not risk going to the commander's camp.
and i will not leave my duty to salute in front of an imaginary titan.
you can't really be thinking of taking this offer.
pompey wants to know what he knows about spartacus to steal victory from him.
and when the time comes, we can take revenge for the wounded.
let us come to ourselves with the theme of the living heat of the
and to comfort the survivors of death.
every drop of roman blood will be spilled in honor of those taken from us!
i'm with professor charles eppes, a calculator from catsci who often consults for the fbi.
are you here to help the fbi find bonnie parks?
for example, we know ms. parks' car was found in san marino mall.
yeah, i've calculated 00 institutions and 00 people who have reason to go after revenge.
yeah, that's true, but every suspect is a different degree impulse.
you know, a circus game where you shoot a clown in the mouth of the clown to fill the balloon.
an asymmetric threat assessment allows us to measure the factorsthat feed motive in each suspect just like the mechanism in a clown's mouth calculating water.
we need to find out if the suspect's impulse was fed to the point where it would detonate
especially the people who are afraid of him, who he intimidated.
the filter pump's been making a lot of noise lately
hello, charlie.
your father mentioned trouble the other day after class, and i volunteer.
on the long run, do a favor for the planet.
his research was a complete closed box.
he worked by himself until the shoot.
i was in the same dorm with some of them in afghanistan.
he doesn't trust his security
i'll go by myself
the lab team solved the notes we found in her office.
your wife, ex-wife, an angry boyfriend.
okay, i'm on my way now.
charlie, who might have tried to do this to you?
because you were already pissed off about my interview.
what happened shouldn't change anything.
it was december.
can we discuss this in the room, not here?
help you.
and you know you sacrificed so much to make her do something big.
i started in this business swinging a hammer when i was 00.
it's making taylor look like a big hero, bringing a revenue center into a bruised area.
he's often talking to the poor guys that taylor's thugs are scared to make room for the site.
i'm still working on it.
that's the problem that requires me to analyze and know what i'm not doing.
i told your dad i'd make a shot.
so how cute is it to see the electric meter returning?
right?
i don't know how long he's gonna
you're either too brave or too young for your brain.
i got sonny layva.
when i find bonnie, she'll mark sonny.
there's no way sonny could have kidnapped a guy
when i was being held on that freighter, when lancer cuffed me, there was something that kept me going through the needles.
that was knowing my team would come for me.
as bad as it was, you, david, were working with megan and don, and you were going to walk through that door.
because i went through the same thing the first time i saw war in afghanistan.
yeah, ten-digit property id numbers, square footage, assessed values, all obscured.
if you apply force to a particular buoy pulling it down, that buoy will drive them down to the shamen of his neighbor.
the neighbors are also neighbors to help raise the shaman.
he was basically strong enough to sink the entire line of buoya.
buying property would make millions.
hundreds of millions, probably.
we never know.
so is this.
it's nothing but a personal feud.
it's not just walls and roofing tiles.
and the whole master architecture spirit was a belief that beauty and practicality are the same.
behind you.
i mean, do you think i'm an errand boy?
you know, better.
what exactly do you do?
nobody likes french.
we've lost contact with our advance troops.
but based on the analysis of the infection's mourning, we know that's where it started to spread the microt.
we won't know until we see a sample.
you will go there with special forces, find any survivors and retrieve a blood sample from the resurrected dead, but at 0:00 p.m., the naval missiles will destroy the entire area.
i don't need to tell you what would happen if 00 minutes got the story.
what's that smell?
we did it.
their attempt to stop the living... has been neutralized.
mom!
megan.
you can't fly, baby.
mom!
mr. edick.
what are you doing here?
we need to talk, janet.
can't we do it some other time?
taking care of my daughter... my daughter
you're not answering my phone.
that's why i came to see you.
no flying.
how can you find me in the middle of san francisco and not find my husband?
your husband doesn't want to be found.
i told you that.
yeah, i said i'd give you all i can.
that's not how it works, janet.
maybe that's because my husband paid you.
you understand?
yeah.
megan?
megan?
megan?
megan?
megan, answer!
mom?
mom?
mom?
megan.
megan?
hello?
please!
please.
i just want to see my little girl.
please.
please.
at least tell me if you're okay.
no nails.
help!
somebody help me!
please.
can you hear me?
i know you're there.
okay.
stay back!
control yourself!
i'm not gonna hurt you.
i came to help.
who are you?
my name's
okay?
i'm not one of them.
i don't
i woke up five minutes ago.
how did you get out of your room?
there was a key.
don't you have a key?
calm down.
do you know why you're here?
why would someone do that?
i owe some people some money.
how much?
about $0,000.
it doesn't seem worth the trouble.
anyone else?
my husband.
what does your husband want from me?
where are we?
i don't
what's the last thing you remember?
i was in the park and... and
where?
san francisco.
i was in new york.
let me see.
i'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
suck your blood.
i think i heard someone else.
yeah, me too.
we have to find them.
really?
yeah.
what's the matter
what if it's the people who took us
what difference does it make
we'll let them go.
of course i can leave you.
hello?
can anyone hear me?
hello?
speak up!
what the hell is this place?
for god's sake, get me out
listen to me.
okay, there's a bible in the dresser.
and a key in the bible.
look at the bible in the drawer next to your bed.
charlie morse.
capital investor.
i'm joe
it's not over
if they want money, i have it.
we're still trying to figure out who they are
can you help me?
didn't i hear the wake-up call?
slow, slow!
take it easy, soldier
we're on your side.
you're a hostage too?
yeah.
we're all hostages.
it's ok
i didn't think i drank that much.
are you okay?
i think it's slipped my standards.
do you know where he is?
do you know what happened?
i think i should make a call.
come.
where are the people who took us?
i won't wait to find out.
it's not working
why don't they come get us?
i don't understand.
that behavior is contagious, sir!
you must keep your strength stable.
i'm sorry
i'm sorry
i just... just
my wife.
if i don't look at him...
i don't even want to think about what
smoke detector.
if the alarm goes off, the magnets can shut down.
what are you saying?
i'm saying if we can make a fire, maybe we can get out
but if the doors don't open, we're stuck here
anybody got a match?
break as little as you can.
splinters.
this is bullshit.
i want to get rid of it and stick it in your throat.
renbe, i can't wait to find out.
i need more confirmation.
is this who i think it is?
better.
you see this?
a man who got lost in a playground yester
something small enough not to interest us.
it was a mother they kidnap
they didn't touch the kid.
a mother who abandoned her child.
no, single mom.
a good mother.
she was home watching kids.
that's... that
if that happens, he could be in san francisco anyway
i found a video.
of course you did.
i'm not talking to conjectives,
cops don't ignore evidence like they used to.
security camera caught everything.
the web nets can't take this for a couple more hours.
vague.
not vague.
it's a waste of hope.
who asked about her?
she's got her grandmother,
you're looking at me.
i'm looking at you.
your missing mom is gonna end up in a body bag, mark.
you know that.
give me the transvestite news first.
then you can look at the missing mom thing.
i can't see anything.
everybody think.
what was the last thing you remember?
last night, i went to sleep like every night, and then i woke up here.
who could have done this?
what are you worth?
value?
i'm meditating in difficult situations for you to learn.
i make $00,000.
$00,000 in retirement money.
soldier?
the army doesn't pay much, sir.
what about you?
i'm not worth anything to anyone but me.
maybe, maybe not.
why do you think they kidnapped you?
i'd rather not say.
what do you do for a living?
no offense, but i don't know who you people are.
we're sitting here thinking about where the bad guys are.
how do we know the bad guys aren't here?
he's right
one of us could be one of them.
but there's only one joe we don't know anything about
everyone has value in someone's eyes.
i don't have money, i don't have
i'm not worth anything to anyone.
maybe life is because of your insurance.
no.
that's the only reason i know for someone to be kidn
not everyone is kidnapped for
right, sergeant?
are you saying someone will cut our heads off?
it's hard to do if we move.
come on, come on.
there you go.
somebody get that table over there.
here.
come on.
move!
move!
are you coming?
what is this?
a hotel.
chinese food?
someone's been here
hello?
cut.
hello?
all the lines are cut.
i don't understand
no sheriff's office?
i wonder who's watching us.
i wish they'd come get us.
this is much worse.
we have a few hours before dark.
shall we walk?
until someone stops us.
is that a weapons locker?
nobody move!
what?
what do you want us to do?
get down, okay?
do what he says.
get down!
which one of you is in charge?
you're in charge, aren'
you're not one of them, are you?
so you're not one of them.
miss, i don't even know who they are, ok
listen.
we were kidnapped just like you.
i don't know about that
get down, okay?
i won't say it again!
if you want to shoot me, go ahead.
i have nothing to lose.
okay?
get the gun!
get the gun!
get the gun!
hold him down.
okay, okay
i won't stop squeezing until i get some answ
what's your name
how do we get out of here?
i don't
red lights, whatever.
i woke up in that hotel over there.
it was you.
i heard you walk past my room.
were you asking for help?
so you're saying you left him?
look, no offense.
enough.
so what do we do with him?
does it matter?
he could be one of them.
okay.
who's coming with me?
me.
what else?
we don't know what's out there
so, what, we stay here?
i'm just saying we should be discreet.
wait till dark.
then i'll take the rifle and i'll go
what if you get caught in the dark?
i'm willing to take that risk.
well, that's your job, isn't
but then you'll be dead with the only rifle we have.
if that's what you think... is
i'm not waiting for the dark.
i'm going home right now.
you can stay here and watch the others.
who authorized it?
you did.
if i'm not back by tomorrow, you'll make
i'll get help.
no, no.
please don't go.
i have to.
were you in the army, joe?
me?
are you kidding?
where did you get such an idea?
what you said.
the way you communicate with that soldier.
what line of work is that?
janet, she's probably very good.
my daughter's 0.
she's allergic, and she has a special diet.
well, what if something happens to you here...
okay, but if something happens to you, you have a family, right?
so your life can't seem to wait either.
who's waiting for you at home?
exactly.
no one can wait.
joe?
joe, can you hear me?
what?
wait a minute!
we can't leave them to die.
we don't leave anyone behind, but there's a way to do it, there's
okay.
okay.
do you think they were shot?
i didn't hear anything.
i don't see any blood.
there should be a lot of blood.
i'm coming, too.
if i were shot, you'd have to figure out where it was fired.
okay.
mcnair!
that obviously doesn't work.
we have to go back.
get in!
get in!
let's go inside.
do you remember the last time you saw your daughter?
not soon.
we were both very busy.
he was a babysitter, and i was...
to be honest, i wasn't talking to my daughter
the truth is, she wasn't talking to me.
until recently, he took me out of his life completely.
i never even met her husband.
she thought megan should know her grandmother.
he never thought i was a good parent.
he said i was bad.
but i never hit him.
once.
i hit him with a hairbrush until it broke.
me and my daughter...
you see, we both have very strong will.
i found this in your room.
no.
no, not mine.
then whose is it?
thank you, grandma.
i look forward to coming home to show my mother.
yes, i'm sure he'll be very happy
now take your baby upstairs and play with it.
i need to talk to mr. renbe.
come on.
come on.
if there's a good thing about it, it's that i won a second chance.
it's a chance to be a good parent who said i wasn't.
yeah, that's definitely a blessing
thank you for your time, ma'am.
and don't worry about your daughter.
i'm sure you'll be back soon
i'm sure everything will turn out just fine.
the supermarket is empty.
what about the others?
they're still lying there.
someone just passing through.
yes, it could be anyone.
you gotta be kidding me.
oh, my god.
okay.

i'm afraid i don
that's not an answer.
okay, charlie
where did you come from?
behind the hotel.
i think he meant before.
a guy called me to start work the next day.
and that doesn't seem strange to you?
i'm used to it.
take a good look.
look closely, ladies and gentlemen.
i was like this before.
see?
take a look now.
now look.
it may seem impossible, it's me.
this is me, ladies and gentlemen!
and you ask yourself, how did he do it?
kiloaway!
how did he do
kiloaway!
and you think at home, this man is here to sell us kiloaway.
this man is here to tell me how wonderful he is.
wrong.
i'm not here to sell you kiloaway.
i'm not here to talk about kiloaway.
ladies and gentlemen, i'm not gonna do
my name is enrique fresan and i'm a nutrition expert.
i'm here to tell you about the 0 step method.
let's start with step 0.

ladies and gentlemen, we have bingo.
so this round ends.
this is me, ladies and gentlemen!
and you ask yourselves, you ask yours
how did he do

what stage are you in now, then?
you don't fit.
here we go.
smile for me.
come on, smile.

i'm not treating people who want to lose weight, i treat people who want to find the cause of their obes
it's the only way to lose weight and stay away from him.
i won't put you on diet.
eat whatever you want.
no more time, no frustration.
before you hurry, you must find your own way.
the key comes up with a plan so we can help each other.
we're gonna ask each other questions and search for answers inside ourselves.
in short, we'll expose ourselves.
let's get started.
i want you all to stand up and take off your clothes.
no one should be ashamed.
then you better leave.
honey, come on.
let's go.
i like being fat and naked.
it's like you're the swimsuit models
honey, please, let's go.
this is a cult...
be quiet.
i'm not fat, i'm overweight.
i weighed 00 pounds four months ago.
then i started getting fat.
one, two, three kilo... three kil
a little diet and exercise and they disappear.
0, 0, 0, 0, 00, 00... 00.
always works.
00, 00, 00, 00, 00... 00. 00.
twenty kilos.
i've had insomnia since i was ten, so i have more time to do stuff and especially eat in the day.
me, too.
i'm on sleeping pills because if i wake up at night i'm starting to eat.
sofia, what are you doing?
what?
you should go and let him stay.
you're not even fat.
i told you not to come.
you insisted.
and i'm glad i came.
come on, move.
jesus!
what a pain!
okay, we can start now.
get dressed.
what are you doing?
paula!
what are you doing?
the window so we can see it.
to see her or to control her?
to check.
what if we need some privacy?
privacy or sex?
we can hang a blind.
we should make noise because it's a noise.
wait, don't tire yourself
no, i want to finish!
no tiring myself, no sex.
i'll do all the work, you can rest.
don't touch
how's the new
did you take your clothes off?
you said you wouldn't.
yes, but i did my speech and kept going...
and now you're horny and you want to fuck.
eh, more or less.
i don't know about you, but i'm going
i think we should talk about this to the community.
if you already know, that will answer your question.
and not telling your family about this should give you a clue.
alex, i'm tired of this.
you're such a rebel, sofi.
we haven't even seen each other naked yet.
the time will come
when, on our wedding night?
what if you don't like me suddenly?
we saw each other in salou last summer.
it's not the
same thing.
so let's do it now.
yeah.
your parents will be here shortly.
then we better hurry.
let me open this switch.
come on.
what do i have to say to talk you out of it?
i'll do it anyway.
you never listen to me.
sofia, no... no...
i don't understand anything.
you're suddenly worried about your physical appearance.
this can't go on.
you don't belong to yourselves." corinthians, 0:00-00. 0:00
romans, romans, 00000.
your turn.
the lady wants to see me?
you want to see?
you'll see.
here.
no.
all of it.
isa spooks me.
so small and wrinkled.
so you don't love me.
no, i'm just nervous.
yeah.
i really don't know...
you got it, sofi?
some things are wrong in god's eyes.
my great-grandfather decaldero...
my grandfather vicente... my grandfather
my uncle paco... my uncle
my father emilio...
my brother fede.
and they all died of obesity-related diseases before they were 00.
i can't even see my dick when i pee.
i saw it and it looked pretty good.
very well.
every inch, every inch, every inch!
the files are copying files...
what are you doing with my phone?
i'll give it back, big ass.
give me that.
get out.
give me that.
careful, you're too fat you can have a heart attack!
you're so selfish!
stop!
what's going on here?
this selfish bitch won't let me use her phone.
ask nicely.
if you want your phone, please.
can i use your cell phone, my twin sister the fat fucking seaweed?
over my dead body, you little phony shit.
good.
communication comes first.
contact problem connection-
this is the story of how my partner screwed up my life.
don't think about what i say!
because you're a pain in the ass.
it's you, a pest that won't go away!
a sewer rat!
idiot!
where are you going?
my pictures are in some magazines, on tv... and sales are down.
it'll cost you 0,000 euros all night.
0000 uero?
i'll show you what's worth to you.
how about a autographed poster?
more pictures of me in the magazines, and i got even fatter, ate more and more worried.
and more and more... and more...
that's enough, my partner sued me, and as a precautionary measure, he froze all my accounts.
are the pills working?
they can't influence your mood.
it's not my fault you're fat, asshole
it defies daily energy needs.
what about the others?
how does being fat affect you in your work?
i knew a new perfume store downtown.
but you'd think i was selling poison instead of perfume...
sofia, how can i help you?
now i'm working a telemarketing job at a big company.
sofia, how can i help you?
i'm too fat to chase bad guys, so i examine dead guys.
one night i was examining a corpse at casa jesusac, a very expensive restaurant i always wanted to go to.
the ring was stuck in his throat and strangled to death
waiter heimch applied, but when the ring came out it was too late.
there was an article in the ring that i couldn't read.
i got curious and... licked the ring clean.
without thinking.
as a reflex.
the problem is, i like it.
tastes like fresh oysters and galicia.
i wonder what the summer was saying?
"i will love you even at the barn."
fair enough.
how does being fat affect you in your work?
i work at home, so it doesn't.
i'm writing internet ptotokics and system codes.
let me get this straight.
my boyfriend's an engineer too
we used to go to the gym, eat healthy food, get together in the morning...
she doesn't know and i won't tell her.
a telecom expert without a webcam?
i didn't want to buy one.
why don't you tell him and get rid of it
how about you help me lose 00 pounds?
when's he coming back?
in six months.
don't worry, if he's in america, he'll come back as fat
does it work?
no, wait a minute.
come back and have a special treatment.
did you go to him later?
no, i didn't.
maybe you should go.
it's not just about saving ourselves.
it's about saving the others, or at least trying.
i'll go if i have to.
don't you trust alex?
but i don't like her looking at naked women.
maybe that's why he doesn't want to see me n
sofia, please... please
there are more effective ways to get to know each other.
why is everything about sex bad or wrong?
you just have to wait for the right time, the right reason and the right place.
speaking of which, tell them about the cult you joined.
they do weird things.
come on!
it's always the
hey, show some team spirit.
00-00 is the set number for the blue team.
come on, you sleep there!
yeah, let him go!
uneasy.
i don't agree.
good.
samuel, you have the service.
come on, get that fat ass up here!
luis, another joke and i'll let you out of this class.
let's go!
you fat fuck.
i'd hit you, but i don't want my hands to be pig fat.
over here, over here.
when you're bored?
under stress?
when you're satisfied?
i mean all day.
i'll have a cupcake, two cupcakes, another cupcake, then i'll have lunch, first course, dessert, a snack, then dinner, and just before bedtime a snack.
isn't that what everyone expects from me?
"look, fat again."
guilty as charged.
i found an effective method to deal with it.
sharing.
so you fatten the people around you.
no, it's not... it
one for you, one for me.
come on, honey, eat.
this is your birthday cake.
he's breaking his routine.
you sick fuck!
you two are really unbearable today.
it's time for

what is this thing?
an automatic arthritis to analyze dna samples.
you can be like my dad.
it was broken, so i fixed it up for you.
so stupid!
don't be so ungrateful
since we know you won't love him, we got you this.
you plug the electrodes into your body, and it troubles the saggy areas.
it would have been nice if it had a zillion elect
cell phone!
he has a camera and everything, and you won't bother your sister anymore.
the megapixels are higher than yours, fat ass.
eat, honey.
then use your body shapes and it's done.
guess where i am.
i'm getting on the plane
where?
teo, teo!
teo, come here!
teo!
teo, come!
teo!
teo, honey.
you see this?
the amniotic sac to the uterus.
you could lose the baby.
what should i do?
paula, what do you think about spending the rest of your pregnancy in bed?
wait... wait...
ready?
one, two... and three.
what is it?
latex bed.
it's a gift from my mother
it's not a bed, it'
no, look.
you're putting two together with this zipper.
sure, you don't know that... or your mother.
don't start with my mom again.
you really... you
you want someone else?
that's pretty
and we shall fit in a meter.
you didn't get excited at sex shop the other day, did you?
no.
you're the only one i love.
i'm scared
why?
you can get tired of me.
that doesn't mean anything.
it means i love you more than anything.
ugly, fat and disgusting.
i don't believe you, i don't believe
how can i prove it?
you're not touching me.
touching.
what am i doing now?
that's not touching.
it is!
that's not touching, alex.
it's touching
and abraham said:
creation, creation,
chapter 00 episode
right, right time, and right place.
don't film me!
run, fatso, run.
go ahead.
what do you want?
you don't have to sue me for that
i've never seen you run before this trial.
clearly you need some push.
you're an asshole and you'll never hurt me.
then get lost, slime.
i sold the loft.
you sold my penthouse?
you have a week to move out.
son of a bitch!
i'm not moving, okay?
what are you doing?
don't pretend to me.
get up, there are people around.
jesus... jesus... jes
help!
help... help...
are you relieved now?
well, yeah, i don't know
shall we do it again?
the sin is already done.
right.
maybe this time you'll last long enough to stick
we need protection for that.
it's wrapped up in a
it won't.
alex... alex
that's not what i mean.
if we do this, we face the consequences.
okay.
you had a little memory.
you just panicked.
what about the other guy
you know him?
my partner.
severe trauma to the skull.
it triggered an aneurysm and severe cardiac arrest.
we've managed to balance him out, but he's probably damaged his brain
enrique... en
oh, jesus!
my jesus!
what happened to him, enrique?
i'll die!
what did they do to him?
do it now.
be brave enough to do that.
i know you're gonna leave me
because i'm fat.
because you won't want to be with someone as fat as me.
because you always hated fat people.
that's why i want you to leave me now.
don't touch me
stop.
stop!
i haven't left the house in six months.
all i do is work and eat.
i have no life without german.
i can't do anything without him.
you can't spend your whole life with a man
i haven't tried different things, i haven't lived, i haven't experienced
i feel like i've been missing out on my life for 00 years.
i got fat because i wanted him to leave me.
leave me, leave me, leave me!
i went for a jog and my partner came to cheer me up.
i suddenly heard a noise and turned and a man was fighting with my partner.
i thought you robbed him.
he pushed her and ran off.
i tried to call for help, but... clearly my heart couldn't take it.
did you see the man who robbed him?
no.
it was so dark.
did your partner have problems with anyone?
no.
last question.
you're the kiloaway guy, aren't you?
kiloaway rules!
kiloaway rules!
kiloaway rules!
kiloaway rules!
kiloaway!
kiloaway!
kiloaway!
look at yourself, please.
in the privacy of your homes, in front of the mirror.
if your answer is yes, forget what doctors and society say.
stop feeling bad.
forget my method, forget my kiloaway pills.
let's move to step 0.
i'm step
it's not important to lose weight, it's how you feel
identify yourself with a word.
light.
happy.
terrible.
let's see if your feelings are connected to your weight.
00 kilos lighter.
i beat the happy nun.
looks like sofia is the only one who's connected to weight loss.
why do you think you lost weight?
i don't know, i've been more active in
i have a goal and motivation.
but i think it's actually because i'm more satisfied in spirit.
a lot more.
i've got some cold water, that's good for your heart.
you wouldn't believe the fuss the neighbors made for the ramp.
we must support each other in this life.
i put your clothes in the closet
i was tired of seeing them scattered around.
disaster!
i'll bring it
what is this?
i checked every test personally.
i can't believe it either.
what?
eat shit, fat ass!
i failed one less class!
asshole.
you're out of one p.e. class.
this teacher must really love you.
paula, what's wrong?
i don't fit in my pants.
why are you wearing them if you know they won't be yours?
they used to be and i wanted to look nice for you.
you look great.
i'm gonna break this fucking mirror.
you're staring all day... all
look at my tits, they're huge!
they're beautiful
you don't like big boobs
don't lie to me.
i'm so scared.
listen to me for a second.
paula, i'm not tired of you
you're tired of yourself.
how many 0 months pregnant women have you seen who look better than this?
all of them
they all tell me how wonderful it is to be pregnant.
that's not what i expected.
you can't go on like this
this is absurd
i know.
you didn't invite anyone?
put some clothes on.
i told my parents i wanted you to get private lessons.
or at school.
i can't stand being anywhere.
you're the only one who's nice to me and has a bigger belly.
you can't move, can you?
i can do your shopping, keep you company, do you some cleaning...
you want sanctuary?
a little.
take off your homework.
how's the new p.e.
he's a jerk.
he makes us run nonstop.
but i just walk like i did with you.
i keep it handy in case my sugar falls.
in case your sugar falls off?
give me that.
open the book.
give me the sugar.
open the book.
is it fixed?
yeah, all right.
if it breaks down again, i'll break your head.
now at cab 0, erika...
erika...
hey, honey.
how was work?
good.
he was looking at his ass.
who, carlos?
i'm so excited!
i don't find it funny.
you're jealous.
no.
do you think that's true?
do you like me looking at other girls?
you wouldn't, would you?
i don't think it's fun
'cause i'm not
all i think about is having sex with you.
and again.
i see you dressed like that and... and...
we could stop by the house, by the way
they brought more furniture?
we're sex addicts.
no, we're love addicts.
pilar... p
we should start sleeping separately.
i can't lie apart, i'm
fine, but i have to get out and find a new apartment.
find a place to stay and someone to take care of you.
pilar!
the doctor said i was good enough to live on.
what's wrong
you're my partner's wife.
we can't play the happy couple.
fine, but you're gay.
you'll be fine
besides, we were friends before i met jesus.
remember that time we slept together in college?
it sucked!
i was sure i was gay that day.
jesus hadn't been with me for 00 months.
i guess he was a little gay.
pilar, no.
i'm horny
close your eyes and think i'm a man.
no!
like one of those hot kids you fucked 000 euros with.
let's see what happens
use some teeth.
that's it, gentle, careful... careful...
until you lean over and give me a blowjob.
did you get an erection?
how was it?
oral sex sucks.
you'll enjoy this experience as much as i enjoy it.
what about him?
did you do something to her?
like what?
like what he did to you.
no, it's disgusting!
one question, mr. therapist.
isn't it unusual for you to discuss personal issues at the bar?
a beer can reveal things in therapy that don't come out of itself.
like your straight relationships.
the nun really bothers me.
he's always talking about happy and his cupcakes and another cupcake and another cupcake...
what a pain!
i think i just saw leonor leave.
i swear it was him.
another one!
what happened to the greedy manager?
i don't
one day he came to the wrong group
sorry, i think i came at the wrong time.
not the time, it was the wrong day.
and he never came back.
i called, but he didn't answer.
then he sent a message saying he quit.
potato chips anyone?
take one.
what was our deal?
just suggesting potato chips.
if he does, i'll take him.
i feel guilty when i eat alone.
you said to stop blaming ourselves.
giving up is another thing, loading on others' back is another thing.
give me that damn jeep!
no more guilt.
feel better?
much better.
how many more pizzas are we looking at?
all i can get is a cold pizza.
"i'm a fat social outcast, i can eat whatever i want" your excuse.
i don't want to hear anymore about this, you understand?
your excuse is ready.
yes, it is.
what is this?
tickets to fund the school trip.
you never sold it.
i'm not going to a party or going on a
samuel isn't going?
i don't
shame it looks good.
come on, like my dad said.
one for you, one for me and everyone's happy.
okay.
right, only the fatest kid in class would like me.
fat couple, nice.
"how nice." do you like him?
he's incompetent, ridiculous, inconsiderate, completely pathetic... pat
great.
if you send him a message, you can eat a slice.
three slices or no deal.
i get 0 slices and sugar in your bag.
i don't have any sugar in my
okay, okay
not the big one, the small one.
aren't you eating?
i don't eat snacks.
you never mentioned him.
he learns spanish and becomes a good christian.
he will sing us a religious song from his country.
okay?
come on, champ.
i dedicate the song to my friend sofia.
so marry me.
how cute.
imagine walking down the aisle to the altar with this music.
no, we'll have a proper choir.
the choir could make a nice fund music.
if you don't let me have my beard, you can forget this
like tarzan.
spearhead.
okay, therapist.
are you sure you don't want to close your eyes and go with the flow?
no, that wouldn't be ethical because i'm your
so goodbye.
can i have another beer?
you brought your boyfriend.
he's not my boyfriend, he's a jer
he told me he was crazy about you.
i just talked to her, she said you were great.
i hate alcohol.
relax, get the job.
come on!
i hate alcohol too.
hi.
pilar, what are you doing here?
pills don't work without you around.
you don't belong here.
why?
i can help you, idiot.
there are less legitimate ways.
don't pay.
why would you pay for sex?
you can't have someone who really loves you.
i don't want to love anybody, understand?
for not finding the right person.
i'm not the right person for anyone, pilar.
come on.
pilar, i'm gay, okay?
i like men, don't you understand?
go away!
go!
why?
i can't hear you.
remember when you came home late and i pretended to be sleeping and you still fucked me?
yeah, i remember.
i saw my gynecologist today.
you know, normal life.
okay.
i have something to do tomorrow.
relax, i'll be right in.
you want me to fall asleep.
i want you to come to bed with me.
and i'm telling you i'll clean up first.
paula?
aren't yours helping you deal with your brother?
my people only think about themselves and their perfect marriage.
all they do is fuck all day long.
whoo!
you must learn to protect yourself.
i found rat poison on the internet.
paula, if she's staying, i'll sleep on the couch.
you'll sleep on all kinds of couch anyway.
come on, put it away.
i'm gonna
come on.
and one for me.
it tastes good, doesn't
even as a child, i felt different.
i didn't like girls playing soccer or anything like that.
because if you're fat and lonely, nobody asks why you're not acting like the others.
no one would have realized i was gay or gay.
but i did not surrender my confusion to the special olympics in '00.
they let me volunteer, miraculously, miraculously,
and they gave me to the swimmers.
there was this incredibly handsome australian who was hired to get him out of the pool because he didn't have legs.
i don't know which made me happier, if he smiled in his wheelchair when he won the bronze medal or when he popped my cherry.
my first joke was an obstacle.
i'm tired of being gay.
really.
we're supposed to be emotional, happy, full of life, tolerant.
mankind priority.
and that's not me.
i can't wait all night for miracle.
go.
you have to pay anyway.
i'm a con man.
i'm the worst faggot of all time
a lying, evil, ruthless cramp.
i'm a contradiction.
contradictions aren't supposed to be
they can always be explained by something we're not ready to face.
so it's better not to run from them, face them and see where they lead us.
because most contradictions come to light.
put your hands on your belly.
close your eyes.
let's all breathe together.
drink it in your...
breathe, breathe.
i thought the problem was my pregnancy, but i was the problem.
we all have contradictions.
they're working on the first step in order to understand what we want or don't want in our lives.
that limits you, but you worship?
i broke the machine on purpose to get there again.
i broke it.
you worship but repress?
what you repressed, liberated you?
who liberates you, yet disgrace you?
who disgraced you but loves you?
what is it that you reject but love?
do you do it because you want to, or just keep pretending everything's okay?
society wants you to be fat.
if you're fat everyone feels better because they feel superior.
not anymore.
now it's time to take the first step
hang on to the reins of your life.
one move could change the dynamic.
but one day of enthusiasm isn't enough for a bottle of kilo-away
kiloaway doesn't work miracles.
it gives you the support you need in the long, hard road to success.
believe me, there's only one way to succeed.
let's take three.
white, pure and clear.
00 kilos lighter.
it's almost brown shit color.
00 kilos lighter.
once again, i beat the happy nun.
shall we choose a fragrance or a astronaut, a tropical bird living in the amazon?
i don't like big tits.
let's see
your glucose level is higher.
not exactly pathological, but you have to be careful.
you could be a diabetes.
your blood pressure's up.
after what you said, it's not weird at all
don't worry, paula.
it's gonna be okay.
just watch what you eat.
if you weren't always with that girl...
what did you say?
nothing.
what are you doing, you fat ass?
you can use blood, nails, body fluids, etc.
i've been given a sample of the proctological enzymes and separatists to separate the dna.
years ago this process was taking weeks.
today, with this machine can be done in less than 00 hours.
so half your note is mine.
we're twin eggs, so the last 0 digits... these and these... should match.
i wasn't trapped.
i even had a very nice boyfriend.
the point is, it wasn't from the
i tried to get him into the community, but he wasn't into spiritual stuff.
i mean, he didn't want to be a virgin until he got
he got tired of waiting and left me.
i got depressed, but then alex showed up.
actually, alex was always there.
two eggs, fried rice, shrimp noodles, and moo shu pork.
do you have fries?
a service.
i want a salad with beans.
i got really fat when i started dating alex.
i can still examine another body.
why?
you must eat, you've got big bones.
that's why i brought you to a chinese restaurant.
let me eat whatever i want.
it won't work.
what happened to your cousin who lost weight in his gym?
now he's fater than he used to be
cover yourself, sofia, for god'
girls wear it like this.
how long?
come on, you like it.
of course you do.
you like it.
you always do what you know.
you're forcing me to make a scene.
i'm not hungry any
you like what you did?
you've lost my appetite.
sofi, really... really...
you're such a rebel.
how can i eat more than you do without weight?
i looked around and all i could find were you two big boys.
you're out of the ordinary, and your sister was a little heavier.
that fat bitch has ruined my life in the first place.
you have lots of baby pictures.
i only found one.
and i was 0.
being adopted doesn't matter that much.
the family is not a biological issue, it's
stop fucking around!
don't say such things.
i'm gonna go crazy and leave the house.
thank god.
luis, you're not adopted.
what about the dna test?
if it was properly applied.
nuria probably forgot to do her hybrids.
i did, i put them in the thermomix steam loop.
how did you transfer the fragments to the nitro cellulosis?
i wrapped it in aluminum foil and held it in the oven for 00 minutes.
ten out of ten.
how did he do it
thanks to what?
thanks to me.
pilar, i'm rehearsing.
so i can fuck you.
nice of you to think of my anal needs.
you don't like
of course i do.
nice big dick.
you want to try?
this is our routine now.
we bring him chocolate, but since it's clear he can't eat, we eat.
then i puke.
then we share a movie for a super year.
then i'm super sick.
then dinner, some champagne, some nice view...
and i... vomit.
then he comforts me.
then i console him.
i'll die!
why do you think you're throwing up so much
i've come to conclude that some reason is not long in my body.
my digest would have watched the normal watch, but suddenly, it turned upside down.
i know what you're thinking, therapist.
aren't you tired of this bullshit?
aren't you tired of reality?
my life is normal for the first time
just like i know you came here to justify yourself so you could continue eating like a pig.
he's condemned to a man who doesn't deserve
what is it, paula?
what is it?
you tell me.
let's discuss this later.
no, we'll argue now.
i don't care!
it's your fault i'm unhappy
is that how he treats you?
does he throw your food away?
does it make you feel like shit?
or is it just me?
explain to me why you don't love me, you don't like me, that i make you sick!
you don't know how much i hate you.
and you, watch your fucking kids.
now we've learned your crap, therapist.
"and the light came to earth...
'cause he stays away from the light that's doing bad things, and he hides it away from him, and
wait, wait.
what are you doing?
go ahead.
it's my turn, not yours.
your turn for what?
since when do you have more than one tingle?
you wanted to be on top, now you want to be an orgasm twice.
what next?
i don't know, we'll
were you touching yourself?
is that why you stay in the bathroom so long?
stop it.
are you crazy?
don't mess with me.
come here.
don't be st
you made me do everything!
damn!
look how angry you make me.
you think i like being like this?
look what i'm in.
you think that's good?
look at me, sofia.
look at me.
you think i want this?
no, my love.
i look at you, you look dirty.
dirty, dirty, dirty!
you... you
fucking device.
what are you doing?
i'm trying to work it
choking him won't work.
tell me the truth, dad.
i want to know the truth.
just because you're weak doesn't mean you
you're disgusting and fat and ugly, but you're smart, like my mother, like nuria.
you always treat me like an idiot.
i don't fit into this shitty family.
okay, i'll repeat the test to prove it to you.
but luis, you're so smart.
there's no stupid part in his body
what the hell are you doing?
i need a test.
i gotta cut your balls.
what a smart son!
i've been with you for ten years.
as soon as things start to come off?
or is that hard?
am i the tough one?
therapist who treats fat people can't stand the sight of his fat wife.
you brought your job home.
look at me.
you can't even look at me.
don't you like me anymore?
tell me.
tell me what's hard.
i don't want to look at you
i love you with all my heart and i can't imagine life without you.
like i'm the biggest idiot in the world.
because you are.
it's called "letter to love."
"the nicod asked jesus,
'how can a man be born?
john 0 in john 0
the part i wrote.
"sofi, i know i'm not going to be born again, i can't go back to the past to fix my mistakes
all i can do is learn from them to be stronger and not repeat them.
you're the one i want to learn to be better and be happy with.
i want to be thrown together and saved.
alex.
deal?
yeah, you got a deal.
everything go back to the way it was?
it'll be like before.
no sex until the wedding.
and my orgasms?
okay.
and you're gonna get fat again.
what?
you said it: everything like before.
don't i look better now?
of course you do.
that's why i said it.
to stop us from obstructing the devil.
asshole!
you've been pulling me down all this time, making me think i can't do better.
i'm ashamed of being with you.
i'm glad this happened today because i realized i never wanted to see you again.
filthy!
jesus?
i'm sorry, jesus.
who, you or me first?
you.
leave me, leave me, leave me!
i left him.
i love you, but i don't love you.
these relationships create a lot of addiction.
we decided to stay friends.
and when we agreed on that, we got together.
typical goodbye sex.
i wasn't fat.
and i was charming.
and wild.
my doubts have begun.
maybe break-up wasn't such a
we decided to be together.
every night, the insomnia and the anxiety came back.
he wasn't there to comfort me.
i felt so bad, i came to therapy on the wrong day.
sorry, i think i got the wrong time.
it's not the wrong time, it
i came to the bar.
i didn't want to go home.
suddenly i realized a man was always looking at me.
i thought you were wondering how fat i was and i wanted to get up.
i asked the waiter for the check, but he said he paid for my drink.
i don't know how, he appeared with me.
we were drinking whisky instead of coffee.
he kept saying how beautiful i was, and he wasn't bad.
then i remembered what i said about trying new things, experimenting with other men, and i looked for comfort...
that's how i met the second guy i ever slept with.
what can i say?
better than any therapy.
i was desired, not fat.
of course, the following week was feeling fat and disgusting again and i couldn't stop eating.
i was supposed to be consoled...
i needed to be consoled.
that's how i met the third man i ever slept with.
but something made me feel like you wouldn't approve of my behavior.
your idea may not mean much to me, but i guess i wasn't ready to hear it.
let's go.
where?
to london to meet your wife and children.
where did you think you were?
that's how i met the fourth man i've ever slept with.
it was like the second and third, handsome and happy marriage.
so i decided to continue to sleep with handsome and married men for three reasons:
i didn't want to get attached.
i was convinced it wouldn't happen again this morning
what convinced you?
the return of german.
i think that's why i slept with all those guys.
i thought it would be easier to forget german.
if he hadn't left because i gained 00 pounds, maybe he would've left because i slept with 00 men.
as you can see, i have decided to go after something.
what did you decide to go after?
i don't
i don't even know whether to ask you to help me or to fuck me.
or to help me by fucking me.
because you're handsome and i know you're married
and you, what's up?
jesus!
i loved you so much!
paula!
pregnant lady, are you there?
ice cream is melting!
paula!
hi, it's abel.
i couldn't understand why men with handsome and happy marriage would want to sleep with a fat woman.
i was wondering.
until one day i stopped wondering.
so don't worry, i won't ask.
what's wrong?
you ruined everything.
everything.
luis, it was a joke.
if i let your jokes get to me like this, i'd already killed myself.
i'm glad you're not my bigass twin sister.
stop whining.
of course we're twins.
not if our fathers are different.
what?
twins different dads different dads different d
you screwed up good this time!
tell me who you are!
tell me!
tell me!
what's going on
what's going on here?
tell him who his father is.
you're my father.
at least tell him!
tell him who you are!
he deserves to know who his father is
tell him who you fucked for me!
i've put up with you my whole life!
i put up with this shit life!
hi, it's abel.
please come.
i'm so scared.
what are you doing, pilar?
i'm trying to wear your wedding ring, but it's not
he lost weight in a coma.
forget it.
listen to me.
go home and grab a glass of warm milk from those sleeping pills.
you're emotionally worn out.
what are you doing?
let me try.
he'd like that, too.
marry me.
what do you say, pilar?
shall we cross the funeral straight to the wedding?
you should think about it.
i've been thinking about it for a
marry me, please.
why would a good-looking, smart, loving woman marry a gay?
i mean with me.
i don't understand
my love for you is true.
i don't even know if you love me a little bit.
i live for you.
only for you.
marry me.
uploading video.
uploading "fatos fucking."
i never expected you to be perfect for 00 years because you were already.
you were perfect for me.
we were perfect for each other.
we had everything.
i know this happens once in a lifetime.
i'll be in the hospital for 0 days.
when i get out of here, i want you to leave the house.
you know, more of everything is harm.
today we discuss the role of man and woman in marriage.
it may seem obvious, but it's more deceptive than you think.
no, my love... my love...
please, don't... ple
don't go
come pray with me!
sofia, what's wrong?
somebody do something.
please!
you have to do it yourself.
but the only thing you can trust is yourself.
and only you will taste victory.
step one step
i never took care of my children.
they were just uninvited guests who were there to cause headaches and up.
the point is, what if someone's not mine?
i shouldn't, should i?
i should be glad.
i was 00 yesterday.
i didn't think i'd live this long.
i wasn't wrong either.
even if i die, i can't lose weight
i was obsessed with finding nuria's real father and lived in a tent for six months.
i ran dna tests on our family, friends, neighbors.
i even got a sample from my deceased brother fede, who went for a walk with beatriz after lunch instead of taking a nap when we spent sundays in the country.
