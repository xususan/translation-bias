michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, it was his brother, buster, who shared his bed.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss mom.
i'll tell him.
i have to write an essay... about the morality of war and the foremost... of a conflict.
i'm not sure you'd like me to cheat when our vice teacher wrote the essay.
so you passed my vice test.
in fact, sergeant bethbaerly burned desperately to his teacher, in fact.
small crimes can be cut even the hands of people who commit crimes.
no ring.
try to remember everything he said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
you need to do something about my son.
you and dad adopted you?
the s.e.c. was watching us.
your father thought it would make us look charitable.
he must have faked my signature.
'a year ago, maybe i'll have a son who... finishes the slim cheese.
you have to save me from this.
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't look at him either.
i don't have a mother's compassion and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disruption.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yes-yes.
by the way, when did you sleep with someone?
meanwhile, lindsay was doing george michael's homework.
why would i tell you that?
i guess there's some things you can't tell your father about.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to arrange for his father to fulfill his mother's duty.
there's nothing wrong with that.
but i still have to tell you i'm a little bit hurt by not thinking about me.
auntie can do that job.
teachers can perform this mission.
sure, one day, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay was never so proud of what she said all her life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i keep telling you.
girl, really... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma," you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache.
yeah.
but gob mistook michael's kindness for his emotional interest... and he felt a competition to interfere.
because, you know, beyond adorability... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
_
and george scr was about to have a surprise visit.
i read all your teachings and got all your tapes.
and i watched them all over again.
george scr has recently been offered a series of records of his suggestions... to make money from the spiritualist he discovered... in order to make money for his people.
i also lost two pounds on your banana blutz jail bars.
i came to learn at your place.
this is a good place to start.
and michael met the parent-teacher night after he got rid of two girls on a date.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or is this room with the same floor plan as our kitchen?
i think he's very nice to you.
i thought it would make her sense of motherhood out of her mind.
besides, i can't just bring a job like this to someone and marry my son because he wants it.
i'm mrs. baerly, the vice teacher.
i'm trying to get my students to understand the importance of life that could be destroyed by some thoughtless trick.
and michael got to know his son's ethics teacher.
that's the "rrrr" side of it.
you know, it's really annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you laughed.
"rrrr" - "rrrr!"
but, you know,
and i think i'm a decent person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite something to drink?
or...
yeah, he's dead.
i guess that's because of mr daniels having a stroke...
let's go get a drink.
yeah, maybe it'll help.
george scr was dealing with his own fan.
i've already told you many sins.
maybe you'll tell me some sins.
well, there are legal demonstrations that show my sins.
but, back to your sins.
tell me about one of those things... that happened at the university hall again.
and michael, what's the deal with his second date today, miss bayerly...
michael, that little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it's him.
you have to strip it down to the freezer to say something for sure.
yes, mom.
they'll get him back.
don't take off your shoes, mister!
don't take your shoes off!
he's out of control.
who is it?
this is "annong," your father and i were adopted.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you find a new son?
lucille buster realized he was worried or even jealous.
and she knew what it felt like to be ignored.
annyong is your brother now
cancel it.
staying.
listen, i'll call you back.
nice driving.
are you making reservations for dinner?
he made a "fucking korean."
and after their rendezvous...
michael took a step he hadn't taken in years.
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think that's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we sneak in without waking everybody up?
this may not be my best idea so far.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but it looks like we're even.
you took someone i loved.
so i took one you liked.
i said, "nashbagerlajam"...
listen, i know you're trying to get back at me for marta.
i was lying to you when i said i wouldn't try to sleep with her, so...
he has to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i really had a chance to get rid of him.
it's okay.
very romantic.
who's "n. penn-ahden"?
hello, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i must say i didn't know it was real.
but, now... your ethics teacher...
yeah, i did that for him.
oh.
she likes saddam hussein.
but, you know, in the business of business, i'm sure you're interested in him.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show him that i care about him.
about his class?
i mean, she loves him...
hello, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was she doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with him.
so, why did he do it?
why did he sleep with my vice teacher?
you and i know that, but gob is new...
he's not one of the good snipers who makes his mark, and he shoots it anywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, he's old for you, don't you think he's old?
we don't even know how old he is.
nobody knows.
he was chasing young girls in different dances... and i was confused by his joke, and i thought i'd...
"hi, do you want to dance?"
and he was like, "what's going to happen?" okay?
i did it differently in the mirror, but...
but, you know, like, uh, dancing with a joke or something.
i didn't think so specific.
don't you think you should go out with someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've uncovered a book that was hard to find a picture of saddam in the bathroom suite.
"what would sadam do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's just the same one our fire escape came from.
in prison, george scr was preparing to spend the evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon makes his own preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael, while he's still mad at gob... he's looking for a family expert to create trouble.
i know you went out with shannon.
the cheerleader?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different dances.
i wish i had someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and asked him... but he was breathing, and he dropped his phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe i should go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hello.
my mother took it.
she's got me recording her at the school.
my new little brother.
so we're relatives.
and michael went to discuss the george michael situation with mrs. bearly.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're into her.
i want to talk to you about it.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality...
you see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, he seems to be in love with you, so...
he knows we're going out.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most unpleasant thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been teaching morality for half a semester.
look, it was a preliminary movement.
my brother was trying to sleep with you.
so, i want to leave you right now, and i'm not coming back.
i see.
from now on.
he went for a walk with george scr. cindi.
george.
and he's getting to know him.
you can squeeze yourself right here.
_
you, uh...
he's got the camera.
i'm taking it to the grandma dance, that's your dinner, away with mom.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy.
watch your back, my immigration little brother!
and the different spring dance was in the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting her in because she doesn't have a perfectly good-looking nose-like eye shape-showing eye.
do you want to dance?
all right!
gob finally found shannon...
gobun found out you were cheating on him with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i screwed up, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about it for a while, and-and...
that's... that's your point.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, my vice teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my vice teacher.
after i treated you so bad, i really was moved by your trying to protect me.
actually, gob mistook michael's ethics teacher... for a citizen's knowledge of morality.
man, he's... he gets it.
gob, mrs whitehead was a citizen's teacher.
second movement.
i was seeing mrs. baerly, and i shouldn't have brought gob into it.
but the day you told me you liked him, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed about some sad things, but...
i don't think we'll have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm getting that cake.
hey, you wanna dance?
i can't believe this is working.
it's in the next arrested development.
buster's chewing.
stop, stop, stop, stop!
no candles are allowed here.
mom would go crazy.
no, it's okay.
i'm lighting my candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
it's okay.
over here, let me help you.
these?
okay, here, i'll carry it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is a real big deal.
too much.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we'll all go one day, won't we?
four months ago, each of you went on an interview to attend a never-ending tv show.
and guess what?
you win.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my biggest color is yellow, like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm totally gay and proud of it.
that's sweet, isn't it?
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel, from england.
me too.
that's my brother stanton; my parole officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him over the head.
he doesn't know.
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they look like barack obama these days.
each of you will make $00,000 a night in this prison, all you have to do is spend one night.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
damn you!
great.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know this is not a prank?
right.
actually, it's our third show, but we're not going to broadcast until the fall.
to see if this is a prank, you'll have to play and earn the money.
you will be asked to perform a series of duties.
the missions will force your limits, your courage and your thinking.
sounds like fun, right?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i didn't have a girlfriend who'd admit it even when she was high.
i need to watch my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are nuts.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
go around.
you'll notice.
the total money will be made equally between the survivors, but if you all take the night off, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can help me stay here.
anyone else wanna join him?
i'm not.
i can't go to the city with this piss boy.
i'm in.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you guys are idiots.
it's a fucking party joke, they're all gonna fuck you.
you don't look anything but a bunch of idiots.
can't you see this is a party on the record?
or we'll be famous.
there's a human head over there!
don't worry, it's not real.
it seemed pretty real to me.
that's why they call us special effects.
pretty cool, huh?
a little sign of what's inside.
thank you for the special effects team.
follow me, friends.
they're in hot swamp water, waiting for lazy crocodiles.
the indian crocodiles are long and skilled.
these alligators...
guys.
i see you're working hard as usual.
ready?
we're totally ready.
exactly and absolutely.
keep it up.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great job you scared them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are gonna be at the show.
you really looked like you were terrified.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really creeps me out.
did you know that?
the dead homeless?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
must be a big coincidence.
do you think it's really safe there?
it's safe enough for the show to get insured.
any more questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're rolling.
each of you was chosen by your own free will to spend the night in prison to earn $00,000 a head.
fair enough, isn't it?
all right, let's get this party started.
you can find anything you need in your main camp, which is the principal's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe one of you better write it down.
but you took everything from us, how can we write it?
go down the aisle, turn right, right again, then left.
straight down the stairs, left, right, and another left.
would you like me to repeat that?
yeah.
too bad.
you'll find a key to get rid of your chains there.
is there anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought going out in the basement was scary.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to the mission.
can you not do that?
i don't see a goddamn thing here.
does anyone remember where we're going?
straight ahead, right, then left.
no, go straight, double right, then left.
too much straight.
no, go straight down the hall,
"do it again, make it right, and then left.
"then straight down the stairs,
"sola, right, and left again."
what are you?
smart.
illet, this is gonna be a great show.
careful.
careful.
jesus.
what is this place?
okay, and get ready.
it was fun.
let's speed them up a little.
okay, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
the power's going down, the generator should have come in by now.
shit!
hurry up!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's freezing in here.
look, the key.
yeah.
okay.
everybody, look.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think it's the manager.
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at that.
what, man?
"hi, brave contestants.
"welcome to the office of clem harvis.
"there's a box in the middle of that room.
"this chess piece will determine your personal role.
"you can't change your rocks with other contestants.
"the razors were his favorite".
"now it's your turn to put your hand in the box."
shit.
so, who wants to go first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black castle.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
damn you!
that was really nasty.
my little piggies, welcome to the mission.
now, let me give you information about the pennyville state prison.
in the time of the crisis of 0000, with the cost, the brutal manager thought he'd raise his fortune by destroying some charges.
they were prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the warden's crimes were exposed.
the last person here was the death penalty, headmaster harvis himself.
rumor has it that the director is still walking the halls.
tonight you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured souls of this building.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
does anyone want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the prison church to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first corridor.
that sounded great.
thanks.
shit!
what happened?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, calm down, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung babies!
your children...
i think they're all covered in speakerphones.
the voices are more effective than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
jesus!
that sounds great.
no, i'm fine, man.
freak.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
there's a sound.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're on speakerphone, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off the flashlight.
okay. now?
open the bible page...
"you will find the lord's prayer there.
"happy disrespect for this place that was sacred 00 years ago,
"if it's now, this is the room of unusual events."
oh, my... the opposite.
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do this.
"when you complete your vision...
"if there's no sign of the director,
"you can go back to camp."
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry who i bother.
it wasn't my idea.
okay.
"protect us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"don't let the evil rule us.
"protecting us from over...
"forgive us our debts as we forgive those who owe us.
"give us our daily bread today.
"as it is in heaven...
"as it is in the sky,
"because judgment and judgment are yours."
please tell me i can leave now.
"before we hit camp..."
jesus, randall, you gotta put out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look at what you've done for money.
where'd he go?
from what i understand, the people who did this job... they cut off our connection to our homo friend to give the job a more frightening air.
whatever.
definitely, it's gone in the clog.
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, dude, it's not that bad.
definitely not worth the money.
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm done.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it again.
they may reassign you.
don't joke.
i swear, you don't even know how people feel there.
it's like walking in a thick fog, just cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting cold in here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go to the next one.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these equipment are very complex.
we'll send scelzi down and get her looked at.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
either we talk or i leave.
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i did a little research.
you mean the local girls you sleep with?
am i right?
big lips, wide hips, taylor.
okay, so the prison's not just for men?
and the women's department?
and that crazy fucking manager would walk around the women's section naked, answered no one.
beat them, raped them, left them pregnant, and starved them to death.
some are told to feed their own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this true story will raise interest in the show!
anyone could be talking about us.
that's nothing compared to the fact that you made up that story.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do this, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
yeah?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yeah, they're working.
good.
scelzi, what is that?
just a little something to get me through the night.
you want some?
get your hairy ass over here, okay?
aye, aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the shit out of me.
i've got a great deal.
suit yourself.
we're totally ready to start.
i'd say my biggest fear is being buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will lead you to freedom."
okay,
i'm at the end of freedom.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and make a right.
damn you!
what?
blood.
it's not real blood.
no swearing, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me you're going up, not downstairs.
i'm sorry.
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
you'll see a finger door once you're down there.
he says...
shit!
welcome to cell five.
"if we think of violence and insanity,
shit.
tell me what i have to do... so i can get the hell out of here.
no!
thanks.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a prisoner doesn't commit suicide,
"now you will live the penalty for a convict."
okay, where's the hole?
under your feet.
this place is so full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult task.
"once you enter, you will be told what to do."
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my mission.
connie.
what?
check this out.
what?
no...
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back and i specifically told you that you added something to the show, and you asked why you were fired?
this is not our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you have to take that guy out, okay?
he'll screw up the show.
shit!
we'll ruin it.
you didn't bring this there?
cut it out, no.
it's obvious.
what's open?
come closer.
i asked you why you were putting a camera in the control room.
yeah.
the surveillance footage they want to record...
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
genius, right?
definitely genius.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to record how you frightened us by putting something in the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black king and white horse.
mission four.
black fort and white queen.
i told you you could be reassigned.
very smart.
okay, black king and white horse turn right and go to the gas chamber.
the white queen and the black horse go straight, and they go to the prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"king and knight go left and then right.
"tale and at the end of the hallway,
"and down the stairs."
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, pick up.
we're in.
"welcome to the gathering room.
there must be a light in the wall behind you, open it.
the black king and white horse are in the gas chamber.
nice set, connie.
that place deserved the best, it was a total real place.
the only place the legal department has ever cleared.
beautiful, isn't it?
pretty scary.
jesus.
what is that smell?
a documented fact of execution, usually carry the smell of death.
of course the smell is not death.
if a man knows that his life is about to come to an end, his anxiety has caused him to release a lot of stench.
in that case, the smell of the man we're breathing in right now is the smell of the gas that killed him.
now it's fun time, ladies and gentlemen.
black king sits in the chair.
black king?
that would be me.
wait for further instructions.
"you'll find some meat and some advice.
you'll cook this meat and eat it.
man!
prisoners are always cows, pigs...
"or not lamb, and another meat...
"that they suspected it.
"they thought it was a pleasant meat they had never tasted before".
you mean human flesh, don't you?
are you in there?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i give up.
you'll connect toni.
i'm transferring you from here, right before toni gas, the fear of all the prisoners has to live.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends have strange wishes.
are you okay?
okay.
"your mission's gas teammate...
"find the main valve and cut the gas before they kill you."
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
wanna bet?
$000 to throw up.
okay.
strange.
i can't do this.
i can't.
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
"no more pranks."
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they'll give them extra money."
do it for the team, girl.
are you gonna throw up?
thanks.
okay, angel, i'm at the bottom of the stairs.
shit!
can you hear me?
he's back.
it really stinks.
let me out.
come on.
let me out, man.
