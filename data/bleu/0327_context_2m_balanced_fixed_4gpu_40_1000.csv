michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, his brother, buster, shared his bed.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss mom.
i'll tell him.
i have to write an essay of at least 000 words... regarding the morality of war and the possibility of a conflict.
i'm not sure our ethical teacher would like me to cheat while writing.
so, you passed my ethics test.
in fact, it was desperate, desperate, desperate, to the teacher at gorgegemichael bethbaeerlyad.
even the hands of those who commit small crimes can be brutally chopped off.
no ring ring no ring ring no ring ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
the s.d.k.'s eye was on us.
your father thought it would make us look charitable.
he must have imitated my signature.
"maybe a year ago, i'll have a son who finished the peep cheese!
you must save me from this.
i'll call social services, but you need buster back.
but i can't look at him either.
i no longer have your mother's compassion and milk.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm sending you an olive branch here.
yes.
by the way, when did you sleep with anyone?
meanwhile, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
i don't know why i'm telling you this.
i guess there's some things you can't tell your father about.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set up his teacher... to help him fulfill his motherhood.
there's nothing wrong with that.
however, i must say i'm a little offended by the fact that you don't think about me for this.
the halos can carry out this mission.
and the teachers can fulfill that mission.
you'll find the right woman one day to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay was never so proud of what she said her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i've been telling you about.
she's really... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
you have a moustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache.
yeah.
but gob mistook michael's kindness for sentimentality... and feels like he was competition to get involved.
because, you know, beyond adorable... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
_
and there was a surprise visit to george sr.
i read all your teachings and got all your tapes.
and i watched it all over again.
george s.r. had recently invented a series of tapes... that he'd refer to to people... to make money from the spiritual spirit that he discovered.
i also lost two kilos of your banana bluth jail bar.
i'm here to learn.
this is a good place to start.
and after michael got rid of the two girls he had an appointment with, he met lindsay in the parents' night.
hey, linds, is this my dream product... or does this place have the same plan as our kitchen floor?
i think she's really good for you.
i used to think it would make him think of his motherhood.
besides, i can't hurry up and get married just because my son wants to.
i'm miss baerly, the ethics teacher.
my goal is to help my students understand the importance of life... that could be destroyed by some insensitive insensitive trigger.
and michael got to know his son's ethics teacher.
that's the "rrrrr" thing.
you know, it's annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were kidding.
no, i was just laughing because you laughed.
"rrrr!" - "rrrr!"
but, you know, maybe...
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a question for you.
can a parent-teacher invite something to drink?
or... or... or... or... or
yeah, he's dead.
i think it's because of this incident that mr. danielels had a stroke...
let's go get a drink.
yeah, maybe it'll help.
george sr was dealing with his own admirer.
i've already told you my many sins.
maybe you'll tell me some of your sins.
well, there are legal shows which express my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me one of those things about... one of the things that happened in the college dorm again.
and what's going on between michael and his second date on today's date on the second date...
michael, this little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it's him.
you have to rob him to freeze to say one thing for sure.
yes, mother.
they'll take her back.
don't take off your shoes, young master.!
don't take your shoes off!
he's out of control.
who is it?
this is annyong, your father and i adopted it.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille figured buster was worried, even jealous.
and she realized how it feels to be ignored.
annyyong is your sister's motheryong now your sister
abort.
she stays.
listen, i'll call you back.
nice driving.
are you making dinner reservations?
he made a korean.
and after the dates...
michael took a step he hadn't taken in years.
well, do you think this is a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we sneak in without waking everyone up?
this may not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i loved.
so i got someone you love.
i said'nashbashbagerlajam'
listen, i know you're trying to get back at me for the marta thing.
i was lying to you when i told you i wouldn't try to sleep her, so...
she has to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i'm lucky i got rid of him.
no problem.
so romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden"?
hi, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i have to say i don't know if it's real first.
but now... your morality teacher...
yeah, i did it for her.
oh.
she loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm pretty sure you're interested in her on the subject.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
about the class?
i mean, i don't think he likes her saddam...
hi, george michael.
i'll go home and think about this.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was she doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with him.
so, why did he do that?
why did she sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new...
he's not one of the good snipers targeting his target, and he's almost everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think she's old?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
well, she was in a different dance... and i was just gonna go to her, messing around with her, and i thought i'd...
"hey, you wanna dance?"
and i thought she was gonna say, "what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it different across the mirror, but...
but, you know, like, we were dancing in a joke, or something.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should go out with your own age?
like your cousin.
i've stumbled upon a book that was difficult to find a picture of saddam's bath suite.
"what would sadam do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's the same as our fire escape.
in prison, george sr. was preparing for the evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon is making his own arrangements.
how we doing?
we have a video.
and when george michael was still angry with gob... he called the family expert on making trouble.
i know you're dating shannon.
that cheerleader?
yeah, he'll probably take her to one of those stupid different dances.
i wish i could bring someone to shock everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels... and i asked him... but he breathed and dropped the phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe we should both go.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hello.
my mother took him.
he's got me registered to do school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the situation with miss bearly and george michael.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality...
see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's like she's in love with you, so...
she knows we're out.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most immoral thing i've ever heard in my life.
well, you've only been a morality teacher for half a semester.
look, it was a preemptive move.
my brother was gonna try to sleep with you.
so, i want to leave you right now, and i'm not going back to you.
i understand.
starting now.
she went for a walk with george sr. cindi.
george.
and she's getting to know him.
you can make me feel completely comfortable here.
it's weighing on my soul.
you...
he's pushing the camera.
i'm taking a grandmother to the dance, so this is your dinner, so it's away with mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy.
watch your back, my immigration little brother!
and the different spring dance was in the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting her in because she doesn't have strong square jaws... with your perfectly flaw-shaped nose like you.
wanna dance?
all right!
gob finally found shannon he was looking for...
gob knew he was cheating on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hi, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i messed up our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about it for a long time, and-and...
that's... that's the right thing to do.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing at a high school dance?
i'm only here with my girlfriend.
yeah, my moral teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
after i treated you so badly, you were really to protect me.
in fact, gob mistook michael's morality teacher... with knowledge of citizenship.
man, she... she understands.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a citizenship teacher.
second move.
i was seeing mrs. baerly, and i never should have brought gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with children.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed about some sad things, but...
i don't think we'll have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm getting this cake.
hey, you want to dance?
i can't believe this is working.
next arrested in developement.
buster screws.
stop, stop, stop, stop!
there are no candles here.
mom would freak.
no, it's okay.
i light my candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
no problem.
right here, let me help you.
these?
okay, i'll carry it here for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is something really extreme.
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we'll all go one day, won't we?
four months ago, each of you joined a refuge, to join a never-before-seen tv show.
and guess what?
you win.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm a total gay guy and i'm proud of it.
you're cute, aren't you?
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel from england.
me too.
that's my brother, stanton, on parole officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him over the head.
she doesn't know.
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they look like barack obama these days.
each of you will earn $00,000, all you have to do is spend one night in this prison.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
fuck!
cool.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know it's not a prank?
right.
it's our third show, but we're not gonna run until the fall.
to find out if this is a prank, you're gonna have to play the game and earn the money.
you will be asked to carry out a series of duties.
the missions will force your boundaries, your courage and your thinking.
that sounds fun, right?
what kind of assignment are they, man?
make up your mind now.
i'm in.
where am i signing?
i didn't have a girlfriend to admit it even when she was high.
i need to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you're out of your mind.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
walk around.
you'll notice.
money equals between survivors, but if you get the night out, there's a rich prize.
no money can spend the night here.
anyone else want to join him?
i'm not.
there's no way i'm going to the city with this piss boy that i'm
i'm in.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you guys are idiots.
it's a fucking party joke, they're gonna fuck you all up.
you don't look like a bunch of idiots.
can't you see this is a recording party?
or be famous.
there's a human head there!
don't worry, it's not real.
looks pretty real to me.
that's why they call our job special effects.
isn't it lovely?
it's a little sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thanks to our reward special effects team.
follow me, friends.
in the hot swamp water, lazy crocodiles are waiting for their prey.
india crocodiles become long and benevolent faces.
such crocodators...
guys.
i see you're working hard as always.
ready?
we're all set.
and absolutely.
keep it up.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great to scare them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are going to the show.
you looked really scared.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, looking at this place, it gives me the creeps.
did you know that?
the dead homeless?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
that must be a big coincidence.
do you think it's really safe there?
it's safe enough for show insurance.
any more questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're rolling.
each of you has been chosen by your own free will, to spend the night in jail, to earn $00,000 each.
clear enough, isn't it?
all right, let's get this party started.
you can find anything you need at your base camp, that's the director's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you've got everything we've got, so how can we write it?
go down the corridor, turn right, right, right, then left.
head to the stairs, left, right, and another left.
do you want me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
there you will find a key to get you off your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought leaving the basement was awful.
have fun, inmates.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to duty.
can you not do that?
i can't see a damn thing in here.
anybody remember where we're going?
go flat, right, then left.
no, go straight, two right, then left.
there was so much going on.
no, go straight down the corridor, straight down,
"give back, make it right again, and left.
"then straight down the stairs,
"sola, right, and left again."
what are you?
smart.
ilylet, it's gonna be a great show.
careful.
careful.
god.
what is this place?
and be ready.
it was fun.
let's speed them up a little.
okay, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
the power's running out, the generator should have come in already.
damn it!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's freezing in here.
look, the key.
yeah.
okay.
look, people.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think it's the warden.
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what, man?
"hello, brave contestants.
"welcome to the warden clem harvis office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room.
"this chess stones will determine your personal role.
"you can't trade with the other contestants.
"the jacks were his favorite."
now it's your turn to put your hand in the box.
shit.
well, who wants first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black castle.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
fuck!
that was really crazy.
my little piggies, welcome to duty.
now let me tell you about the pennyville state prison.
in 0000, with the cost of crisis in 0000, the cruel warden thought to increase his fortune by destroying some expenses.
these were the prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the warden's crimes were exposed.
the last person who was sentenced to death here was principal harvis himself.
rumor has it the director's still walking through the halls.
you will be asked to face the principal tonight and face tortured souls under this building.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
does anyone want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the church of prison to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first corridor.
that sounds awesome.
thanks.
damn it!
what happened?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, calm down, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung the babies!
children...
i guess they're all covered with speaker phone.
voices are more effective than images to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
god!
that sounds lovely.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
something came up.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're calling from the speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off the flashlight.
okay?
open the bible marked page...
"you will find the lord's prayer there.
"there has been disrespect for this place that was sacred 00 years ago,
"and now this is the office of extraordinary events."
oh, it's the opposite."
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do this.
"when you complete your mission...
"if there's no sign of the director,
"get back to camp."
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry about who i'm bothering.
it wasn't my idea.
okay.
" protect us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"do not let evil rule us.
"protecting us all...
"as we forgive those who owe us, forgive us our debts.
"give us our daily bread today.
"as in heaven...
"as in the sky,
"because rule and rule is yours."
please tell me i can leave now.
"before i go camping,"
god, randall, you need to blow out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look at what they're made for money.
where'd she go?
i understand that those who did this job had cut off our connection to our homo friend for a while to give a more frightening weather.
whatever.
absolutely, it went very well.
guys?
i think we did something awesome.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, dude, it's not that bad.
definitely not worth the money.
but the mission was worth money.
thank god i'm finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it again.
they can serve you again.
no kidding.
i swear you don't even know how people feel there.
it's like walking in a busy fog, only cold like ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated.
let's send scelzi down and have a look, you're on.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
either we talk or i'm gonna go or i'm gon
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i had a little research done.
you mean, "don't fuck" and those town girls?
am i right?
big lips, wide hips, taylor.
okay, so prison isn't just for men?
is there a women's department?
and that goddamn crazy principal wouldn't answer anybody if she'd just walk around the women's section.
beat them, rape them, get them pregnant, and starve to death.
some people say they feed their own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this true story will improve the show!
everyone could be talking about us.
that's nothing compared to the story you made up.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do that, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
really?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they do.
good.
scelzi, what is that?
it's just a little something to get me through the night.
want some?
get your hairy ass here now, okay?
aye, aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the hell out of me.
i got a great stuff.
suit yourself.
we're fully ready to begin.
i can tell you my biggest fear is being buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will set you free."
okay,
i'm at the end of freedom.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
fuck!
what?
blood.
it's not real blood.
no mold, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me you're going upstairs, not downstairs.
i'm sorry.
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down there, you're gonna see a finger door.
he says...
damn it!
welcome to cell number five.
"if we think of the violence and insanity of violence and insanity,
shit.
tell me what to do... and i'll get out of this hell right now.
no!
thanks.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, " if a prisoner can't commit suicide, if a prisoner can't,
"now you will be sentenced to a prisoner."
okay, where's the pit?
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult mission.
"what are you gonna do when you're in the hole."
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my mission.
connie.
what?
check this out.
what?
no... no...
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back, and i specifically told you that you add something to the show, and you ask me why you're fired?
this is not our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you have to get that guy out, okay?
she's gonna ruin the show.
damn it!
we'll be ruined.
and you didn't bring this?
cut it out, no.
very clear.
what's open?
come closer.
i asked you why you put a camera in the control room.
yeah.
camera footage... they want to record... what they want to...
wow!
wow!
you're right.
it's brilliant, isn't it?
absolutely brilliant.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to record how you scare us by putting things into the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
three.
black king and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you'd be back on duty.
wiseass.
okay, black king and white horse go right and go to the gas chamber.
the white queen and the black horse go straight, and they go to the prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"the hawk and horse first turn left and turn right.
"and ride out to the end of the corridor,
"and get down the stairs."
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, pick up.
we're in.
"welcome to the gathering room.
there must be a light in the wall behind you, turn it on.
"black king and white horse go into the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
it deserved the best there, it was a real place.
it's the only place the law firm cleansed.
isn't it beautiful?
pretty creepy.
god.
what's that smell?
a documented true execution rooms often carry the smell of death itself.
of course, the smell is not your death.
if a man knows that his life has come to its final moments, his anxious anxiety is caused by an epidemic which gives him plenty of scent.
in this case, the human smell we're breathing now is the smell of gas that kills him.
now for fun, ladies and gentlemen.
the black king is sitting in the chair.
black king?
that would be me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you will find some meat and some chicken.
you'll cook this meat and eat it.
man!
inmates have always eaten meat cow, pig...
"or that there is no lamb or another meat...
"and they suspected it.
"they thought it was a pleasant meat they never tasted before."
you mean human flesh, right?
are you in?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i gave up.
you're gonna connect toni.
i'm telling you, toni should fully experience the fear of the prisoners just before gassing gas.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends had some weird wishes.
are you okay?
okay.
"your duty is to...
"before you kill the main van to find the main van and cut the gas."
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to vomit.
okay.
strange.
i can't do this.
i can't.
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
no more donkey jokes.
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they'll pay the extra money."
do it for the team, girl.
