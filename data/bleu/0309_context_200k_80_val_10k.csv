michael was in bed for the first time in years .
unfortunately , the man she share her bed share her brother , buster .
buster .
buster .
hey .
i don ' t think it ' s appropriate for both of us to sleep together .
yeah , i miss mom .
i ' ll tell him .
i have to write a test of at least 000 words about the moral side of the war and preliminary apocalypse .
i ' m not sure our morality teacher likes me to cheat when i ' m trying to write a trial .
so , you passed my morality test .
in fact , the wise teacher at the beth bhbaerlyaierad . . . caught the brother in desperate hope .
anybody who ' s committed a small crime can be cut to death .
he ' s got no ring , no ring
try to remember everything he said about me , okay ?
okay .
michael .
you need to do something about my son .
and you were adopted ?
the eye of the d .d .k . was on us .
your father thought it would make us more charming .
he must have imitated my signature .
 ' i ' d be a son who ' d just finish the cheese before a year ago !
you have to get me out of this .
i call social services , but you gotta get buster back .
but i can ' t look at him either .
and i don ' t have a mother ' s compassion and milk anymore .
hello .
michael .
there ' s two girls here .
a couple of fun girls . . .
come on , michael .
we had a little disgrace .
i ' m selling you olives .
yes-yes .
by the way , when did you sleep with someone ?
by the way , lindsay george michael was on his homework .
if i tell you why .
i guess because there are things that you can ' t tell your father about .
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set up his teacher to set up his father . . . so that he could have his mother ' s mission .
there ' s nothing wrong with that .
but i still have to tell you that i ' m a little disappointed that you don ' t think about me for this .
that ' s what the aunt can do .
the teachers might be able to replace this mission .
sure , someday , you ' re gonna find the right woman to do this job .
but until i do , i ' ll be right across the hallway .
lindsay ' s never been so proud of what she said in her whole life .
meanwhile , gob was waiting for michael to come .
shannon , the girl i was telling you about .
she ' s really . . . young girl .
your appointment , nazh . . .
galia .
and here ' s your date .
"nearma , you got a mustache .
i mean , there ' s milk on the mustache .
yeah .
but gob michael ' s courtesy of the sentimental interest in the sentimental interest . . . and he felt like a competition to get involved .
because , you know , beyond love . . . and exotic .
i find you very attractive .
"kilia , michael , shannon" really ?
and a surprise visit to george sr .a . was about to come .
i ' ve read all your teachings and got all your tapes .
and i watched them all again .
george sr . discovered a series of tapes that he offered people . . . in order to make money from the ruin that he had just discovered .
i also lost two pounds by eating your banana blut jail bar .
i came to find out .
this is a good place to start .
and michael met lindsay at the parents '  school night after she got rid of two girls she got out of a date .
hey , lindsay , is this my dream product . . . or is this one of our rooms with the same kitchen floor plan ?
i think he ' s really good for you .
i thought that would help you get your mother ' s idea out of your head .
besides , i can ' t get married to somebody just in such a hurry just because my son wants to .
i ' m mrs . baerly , the moral teacher .
my goal is to make my students realize that life is important . . . that they can ' t have the value of life . . . that can be destroyed by a desperate trigger .
and michael got to know your son ' s moral teacher .
that ' s the "rrrr" part .
you know , it ' s annoying .
i mean , they gave me this class after mr . daniels '  paralyzed paralys .
i thought you were kidding .
no , i was just laughing because you laugh .
"rrr !" - "rrrrr !" ! !" ! ! ! ! !
but , you know ,  . . .
and i think i ' m a moral person .
yeah .
one question for you .
can a parents teacher invite a drink ?
or . . . or . . . or . . . or . . . or
yeah , he ' s dead .
i think it ' s because of mr . daniels '  paraly . . .
let ' s go have a drink .
well , maybe it will help .
georger . was dealing with his own fan .
i ' ve already told you many sins .
maybe you could tell me a few sins .
well , there are guys that show my sins .
but back to your sins .
tell me one of those things . . . one of those guys at the college bedroom again .
and what ' s going on with mrs . mr . mr . mr . mr .erly meeting today . . .
michael , this little korea is here , and i don ' t know what to do with it .
at least , i think it ' s him .
you ' re gonna have to steal it to say something for sure .
yes , mother .
they ' ll get her back .
don ' t take your shoes off , little man !
don ' t take your shoes off !
it ' s out of control .
who is it ?
this is annyong , your father and i are adopted .
what , i ' m leaving for a few days and you and a new son ?
lucille found that buster was worried , even jealous .
and she realized what it feels like to be ignored .
annyang ' s your brother ' s your brother ' s your brother
abort .
stay .
listen , i ' ll call you back .
nice drive .
you make dinner reservations ?
it was a chore .
and after the meeting . . .
michael has set foot in the past for years .
well , do you think that ' s a good idea ?
i think it ' s a great idea .
mm .
very good idea .
but how are we gonna sneak in without waking everyone up ?
this may not be my best idea ever .
i ' m sorry , michael .
i ' m sorry , michael , but it looks like we ' re even now .
you took someone i love .
so i got one you love .
"nashbashbagerlajamamam . . ."
listen , i know you ' re trying to get revenge on marta thing from me .
i was lying to you when i told you i wasn ' t gonna try to get him to bed , so . . .
he has to accept that .
i don ' t think there ' s any problem with that .
right .
i slept with someone new .
again , i didn ' t like nazhildia .
i really lucky i got away with it .
no problem .
so romantic .
who ' s "n . a-ahden" ?
hi , george michael .
i wanted to talk to you about something , but i need to tell you that i didn ' t know it was real .
but now . . . your moral teacher . . .
yes , i did it for him .
oh .
she loves saddamsein .
but , you know , i ' m pretty sure . . . that you ' re interested in him .
i ' m sure you don ' t like sadam .
you know , i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her .
about her class ?
i mean , she loved him . . .
hi , george michael .
i ' ll go home and think about it .
i ' ll go home and think about it .
dad , what was he doing here ?
michael knew you had a moral responsibility to tell your son the truth .
yeah .
your uncle gob slept with him .
well , why would he do that ?
why did he sleep with my moral teacher ?
you and i know this , but gob new . . .
he ' s not one of the good snipers who ' s targeting his target , and he ' ll shoot anywhere .
you know , but listen , did you really think that . . . he was . . . ?
i mean , she ' s old for you , don ' t you think ?
we don ' t even know how old she is .
nobody knows .
she ' s been escorting young girls in different dances . . . and i was wondering if i could go to her mess with the joke , go and do something . . .
"hi , do you want to dance ?"
and he ' s like , i thought , "what ' s gonna happen ?" okay ?
i did different in the mirror , but . . .
but , you know , well , we ' re just messing with jokes or something .
i didn ' t think so .
don ' t you think you should date someone your own age ?
like your cousin .
i ' ve provoked a book that ' s hard to find a picture of the bathroom picture in the bathroom suite of my loyalty .
"what would my room do ?"
yeah .
yeah , you know something ?
okay , here ' s the same thing as our fire escape .
in prison , george s .r . was getting ready to spend the night with his most loyal fan .
when cindi lightballoon made his own prepared .
how are we doing ?
we have a video .
and george michael still went to gob to find out if you were still angry at gob when he was still angry at the time .
i know you ' re dating shannon .
with that ponpon girl ?
yeah , he ' s probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different dancers .
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone .
you know , i actually called mr . daniels , and i asked him . . . but he was breathing and he dropped his phone .
i haven ' t heard back .
you know , maybe i should go together .
right , i mean , it was a bad example . . .
hi .
my mother took her .
do told me he ' s making it up .
my new little brother .
so we ' re relatives .
and michael went to discuss the situation with mrs . bearly and george michael .
i ' m sorry .
hi .
don ' t worry .
so , you ' re interested in him .
that ' s what i want to talk to you about .
but i liked spending time with you .
if you want to talk about moral . . .
see , george michael made you this poster .
you know , he ' s , like , in love with you , so . . .
he knows we ' re coming out .
i told him you slept with my brother .
this could be the most moral thing i ' ve ever heard in my life .
well , you ' re only half a semester .
look , it was a preliminary move .
my brother was gonna try to sleep with you .
so , i want to leave you right now , and i ' m not coming back to you .
i understand .
from now on .
she went for a walk with georger . gin .
george .
and she ' s getting to know him .
you can totally squeeze me in here .
it ' s weighting my soul .
you . . .
he ' s fighting the camera .
i ' m taking a dance , this is your dinner , so far away with mom .
actually , lucille annyong and maeby were taking her somewhere .
you ' re trying to steal from the wrong guy .
watch your back , my little brother ' s my little brother !
and the different spring dances were in the last temple .
wow , i ' m sorry .
i mean , just because he doesn ' t have the perfect , perfection-thinking nose like you doesn ' t mean he hasn ' t got strong square eyes .
you wanna dance ?
all right !
gob finally found the shannannon she called . . .
gob had found out that he was cheating on her with nazarethia .
shannon , where are you ?
shannon !
hey , lisa .
shannon !
excuse me .
listen , i screwed up , okay ?

george .
what are you doing at a high school dancer ?
i ' m just here with my girlfriend .
yes , with my moral teacher .
hey , george michael .
you slept with my moral teacher .
it really made me hear that you were trying to protect me after i was so bad to you .
actually , gob got michael ' s morality teacher . . . mixed up with his teacher ' s information .
man , he . . . he knew .
gob was mrs whitehead ' s country teacher .
second move .
i ' ve been seeing miss baerly , and i shouldn ' t have involved gob .
but the day you told me you liked her , i didn ' t know what else to do .
i never meant to hurt you .
i didn ' t know you two were serious .
well , you know , i ' m open to that .
we ' re open to that .
wow !
no , no , no , no .
just one day , you know .
i ' m not good with kids .
lady said no , man .

i mean , we laugh at some sad things , but . . .
i don ' t think we ' re gonna have a future .
and , jeremy , i ' m taking this cupcake .
hey , you wanna dance ?
i can ' t believe this worked .

and guess what ?

i think some people came to life on tv , and i ' m one of them .
my favorite color is yellow , just like the sun .
hi , i ' m randall , and i ' m really gay and i ' m proud of it .
you ' re so cute , aren ' t you ?
i want to rule our country .
next question .
my name is angel from england .

he doesn ' t know .
but i know .
dixon , 00 pounds , 00 pounds .
people say i look like will smith .
they look like barack obama these days .
each of you will win $00 ,000 , all you have to do is spend the night in this prison .
this abandoned prison .
wow !
damn !
cool .
how come i never heard of this show ?
how do we know if it ' s a donkey joke ?
right .
actually , this is our third show , but we ' re not gonna run until the fall .
you ' re gonna have to play the game and win the money to see if this donkey joke is a joke .
you ' re gonna have to be asked to do a series of duty .
the guards will force your border , your courage and consideration .
sounds fun , doesn ' t it ?
what kind of mission are they , man ?
make your decision now .
i ' m in .
where do i sign ?
i didn ' t even have a girlfriend who ' d take it when he was high .
i need to take care of my little brother .
i ' m in .
you guys are crazy .
do you know the past of this prison ?
some of them just went in there .
like what ?
walk around .
you ' ll notice .
the total amount of money to survive the survivors , but if you all take the night off , you have a rich prize .
no money can spend the night here .
anyone else want to join him ?
not me .
i can ' t have to go to the city with this pissed kid , i can ' t
i ' m in .
get me out of here .
your car ' s waiting .
untie him .
bye .
you ' re an idiot .
it ' s a fucking party joke , they ' re all gonna fuck you .
you ' re nothing but a bunch of morons .
can ' t you see , it ' s a party on this rock .
or we ' ll be famous .
there ' s a human head !
don ' t worry , it ' s not real .
looks pretty real to me .
that ' s why they call our business special master business .
lovely , isn ' t it ?
a small sign of what ' s waiting for you inside .
thank you for our rewarded team .

you really looked like you were scared to death .
because i was .
i mean , first of all , this place is really creeping me out .

homeless people ?

it ' s safe enough for the show insurance .
any other questions ?
yeah .
how do you sleep at night ?
like babies .
let ' s do this .
okay .
we ' re moving in .
each of you were chosen by your own free will , spending the night in prison , winning $00 ,000 a head .

you can find everything you need in your main camp , it ' s the manager ' s office .

it ' s complicated .
maybe one of you better write it down .
but you got all our superiors , how can we write ?
go down the hall to the right , turn right , right again , left .
straight down the stairs , left , right , and another left .
would you like me to repeat it ?
yeah .
too bad .
you ' ll find a key to get your chains out there .
is anyone in there ?
we ' ll see .
i thought leaving the basement was terrible .
have fun , prisoners .
good luck .
where ' s he going ?
welcome to the mission .

"you cannot change your stones with other contestants .
"j ' s his favorite was his favorite" .
"is your turn to stick your hand in the box ."
damn .

black .
black castle .
white horse .
white queen .
look .

that was a really crazy thing .
my little pigs , welcome to the mission .
now let me tell you about pennyville state prison .
in the time of the 0000 crisis in the time of 0000 , when the price was over , the brutal manager thought he ' d raise some expenses .
they were prisoners !
the warden ' s crimes have already been executioned by 00 prisoners until they ' re clear .
the last person who was punished for his death sentence here was director harvis himself .
rumor has it the warden is still walking around the halls .
tonight , you will be asked to face the warden and this building , tortured by tortured souls .

your white queen .
try not to die !
anyone want to change ?
hell no !
okay .
"the white queen must go to prison to complete his mission .
can you hear me ?

that sounded great .
thanks .
damn !

they shut down my flashlight .
i can ' t see anything .
okay , take it easy , randall .
now turn right and go straight .
they hanged babies !
their kids . . .
i guess they ' re all dressed up with the donors .
voices are more effective than image to trigger our fears .
is that right ?
okay .
god !
that sounds great .
no , i ' m fine , man .
crazy bastard .
did you hear that ?
what ?
i don ' t know .
there ' s a sound .
i think someone ' s in the room with me .
they ' re calling from the driver , randall .
really .
okay .
oh , my . . .
nice set .
they want you to close your flashlight .
okay ?
turn on the bible . . .
"you ' ll find god ' s prayer there .
" 00 years ago this place was disrespectful to this place ,
and if it ' s my job , this is the room of extraordinary events .
oh . . . the opposite .
no way .
no , man .
don ' t do this shit .
i can ' t do this .
" when you complete your home . . .
"if there ' s no sign of the manager ,
"you can go back to the camp ."
a deep breath , randall .
do it .
i ' m sorry about who i ' m bothering .
that wasn ' t my idea .
okay .
"s protect us from evil . . .
" our father ' s father in the world . . .
"don ' t let the evil rule us .
"prot sorry to humiliate us . . .
"forgive us our debts , forgive us our debts .
"give us our bread today .
"like in heaven . . .
" as in the world ,
"because rule and government is yours ."
please tell me i can go now .
" before you hit the camp on the way to the camp ."
god , randall , you have to put out the candle .
you ' re kidding , right ?
sit there a minute .
look at all the money .
he ' s gone .
i understand that those who do this job were to give us an even more creepy weather to give our homo friends a more frightening weather .
anyway .
definitely , she ' s gone .
everyone ?
i think we did something really cool .
everyone ?
everyone ?
everyone ?
did you see anyone ?
no .
come on , dude , it ' s not that bad .

but the mission was worth the money .
thank god i ' m done .

i guess i can ' t do it again .
they can give you a mission again .
no kidding .
i swear to god , you don ' t even know how you feel in there .

big lips , large thighs , taylor .
okay , prison wasn ' t just for men ?
the women ' s part too ?
and that fucking runaway director women wandered around the section of the women ' s section , never answered to anyone .
he ' d beat them , rape them , get pregnant , and starve them .
some say they feed their own babies .
what does that mean ?
what do i mean ?
this true story is gonna raise the show !
maybe everyone ' s talking about us .
it ' s nothing to compare to the truth of this story you made up .
me too .
so why don ' t we use this ?
because if we do this , the town will sue us .
okay .
are we done here ?
yeah .
yeah ?
what is it ?
anyway , i ' m gonna get some sleep .

look at me .
he says , " if a prisoner kills suicide , if he can ' t do it ,
"right now you ' re going to be punished for a prison conviction ."
okay , where ' s the hole ?
under your feet .
this place is so full of shit .
remember the money .
this is a very difficult mission .
"and you ' ll know what you ' re gonna do when you get in the halfway through
okay .
hello ?
hello ?
no offense , but i hope you ' re not my mission .
connie .
what ?
look at this .
what ?
no . . .
you ' re fired .
why ?
you ' ve turned from behind my back and you ' ve done anything in particular even though i ' ve told you , and you ' re still asking why you were fired ?
this is not our man .
where ' d he go ?
who the hell is this ?
i don ' t know .
don ' t look at me .
look , connie , you have to get that guy out of here , okay ?
he ' s gonna stick it in the show .
damn !
we ' re ruined .
so you didn ' t bring this in ?
stop it .
very clear .
what ' s open ?
come closer .
i asked you why you were putting cameras in the control room .
yeah .
the back camera footage . . . they wanted to record . . .
wow !
wow !
you ' re right .
genius , right ?
absolutely genius .
what are you two talking about ?
we ' re part of the game too .
so the company wants us to know how you scare us by putting things in a show ?
bingo !
so what do we do now ?
we ' re going to go ahead .
as planned .
three .
black and white horse .
four .
the castle and the white queen .
i told you you could get back on duty .
he ' s so tired .
okay , black and white horse turn right and go to the gas room .
the white queen and the black horse go straight to the prison kitchen .
okay , later .
good luck .
"and to the left and to the right .
"tit and at the end of the hallway to the end of the hallway ,
"and down the ladder down the stairs ."
scieli , come in .
i need to talk to you .
sciel , are you there ?
can you hear me ?
come on , open it .
we ' re in .
"welcome to the laptop room .
there must be a light on your back wall , open it .
they ' re going into the black and white horse gas room .
nice set , connie .
it deserves the best , it ' s totally the place .
the only place the law department cleaned up .
isn ' t it beautiful ?
pretty creepy .
god .
what ' s that smell ?
they usually carry the smell of death to a stenciled real death .
of course it ' s not the smell of death .
if a man knows his last mom ' s last moments of his life , the last raddee has caused his creepy stuff to give him .
in that case , it ' s the smell of the human smell that we now breathe and the gas that killed him .
fun time , ladies and gentlemen .
he ' s sitting in the black chair .
black person ?
that ' s me .
wait for further instructions .
"or a bit of meat , and you ' ll find a chicken .
"you ' ll cook this meat and eat ."
man !
prisoners are the skirt they always eat , pig . . .
"and because he has no lamb and another meat . . .
"they were suspicious of what happened .
"they ' ve never tasted before , they thought it was pretty meat" .
you mean human flesh , right ?
are you inside ?
yeah .

ed , wait .
agent 0 , report .
repeat , the cia contact officer has been shot .
agent 0 , do you see qasim ?
command center , i heard a vehicle .
they shut everything down .
it ' s over .
the president of the american terrorist terrorist leader agem qasim can confirm that one of the most serious mistakes in the history of the ' s organization has escaped from mi0 custody .
obviously , the security convoy transporting qasim was attacked at the rack of raven north .
because it ' s in the west streets , you call it a murder .
because in new york , washington , you didn ' t want this in london .
but pakistan didn ' t want kids either .
when they were hit with drone air planes , they call it murder .
qasim is offering a new kind of threat .
so far he hasn ' t targeted civilians .
our model shows a 00% chance of an attack in 00 hours .
the more pressure goes under , the longer the window gets so small .
i can ' t say that while i ' m under the tape tape rec tape . . .
the foreign minister ' s coming tomorrow .
we serve the british people , not washington .
if that ' s not true anymore , we ' re already done .
the americans think we don ' t serve purpose anymore .
we need a head .
i ' ll be off duty in the morning .
have you heard anything about the escape of qasim ?
i don ' t think so .
harry , what happens to me if you take it off ?
you can take it off too .
no one knows qasim was in his network .
just go .
will howay ?
go .
how ' s life after mi0 ?
you ' re not from moscow .
london needs you .
anyone you need to say goodbye ?
thank you .
we know harry ' s contact with your family , so we understand this may not be easy for you .
even if he ' s dead , it ' s fine .
harry ' s too arrogant to kill himself .
he was pretending to kill himself .
he went to this woman ' s grave .
the love of your life .
harry ' s team has noticed a change in harry ' s attitude since she died .
emotionally , it ' s cold , it ' s getting high alcohol .
it would be under 0 degrees .
she ' d have had a hippo after the bank reach .
this is the picture you said you were taken after the picture taken into this land .
before she disappeared , harry made three locked phone calls .
your old emergency message box .
why did she call you ?
i have no idea .
the last time i spoke to her , when she got me from mi0 two years ago .
she wants to talk right now .
that makes you useful .
can you help us find him ?
no , thanks .
and you , harry , talk a lot about berlin ?
the night your father died ?
if there ' s anything else , mace , i have a right to know .
i don ' t think i can decide that . . .
if you ' re really not going to kill him , i think you ' ve told me what you want to say .
find harry so you can ask him about berlin yourself .
who are you ?
i thought i was gonna take this title to the grave .
lately , the anti-terrester president for his majesty ' s security service .
funny , but who are you really ?
it ' s someone who knows how important these two words are to you .
asma shishani .
go .
how did you find me ?
what do you want ?
one of my side , i know .
they never told me who they were .
of course not , but you must have a connection .
a phone number , that ' s all .
the phone number works too .
in return , i ' ll give you what you want .
impossible .
he said he was a human rights attorney .
your government helped them after you put my two brothers in jail .
but she started being too curious after i was released .
i don ' t know this woman .
if he ' s a agency , he ' s not one of us .
and if you don ' t mind , tell me there ' s no value to you again .
keep her alive , the guarantee i ' m gonna keep my promise .
i don ' t need a guarantee .
take her to a hospital now or the deal ' s off !
what he needs is mercy .
no !
she has a daughter .
and you sent him after me ?
you put him in danger , and now you refuse to save him from pain ?
how the hell are you ?
don ' t send your family video .
harry . . .
you have an deal .
according to the , the fugitive terrorist adam qasim has no way of getting caught .
the national threat level has been critical , so there ' s an attack on his hand .
in the heard news , the ftse fell 000 this morning again , the stterlin , the doin ' s , the euros , and the rest of the money ' s left .
there ' s a new intel on harry .
he took a convenience line we tracked him down to kent cast .
howay , this is a secret information .
we also found explosive marks there .
you ' ve known him longer than all of us .
do you think it ' s possible that qasim got harry in business somehow ?
pull him over ?
i don ' t know .
anyway , you find harry , we find qasim .
anything for howay ?
here .
tomorrow , 00 .
salpa 0 , a , put it in 0 park .
then open your eyes .
i hope you come alone .
just for protection .
if you can ' t bring down a crazy cold war morgue , we ' re really in trouble .
i promise not .
not yet .
we ' re playing harry ' s game until we see him .
understood .
doors open .
go .
floor .
doors open .
open space , more than one exit .
repeat , howay .
things harry needed to set up a meeting .
yes , mr holloway , your uncle said he ' d meet you at the coffee shop .
she left her cell phone at home .
the man in the parking lot , get rid of him .
he ' d be wearing a mi0 shirt .
listen to me .
stop underestimate harry .
don ' t think he ' ll put your men in danger .
wait for the signal . . .
what is it , alpha 0 ?
howay ?
howay , where are you going ?
wait .
no , we ' re not there .
don ' t move .
howay , don ' t move !
the original 0b .
doors shut .
he set me up with a flight .
pa000 , glasgow plane .
i ' m going to glasgow .
call the glow office .
get me the airport police .
prior code cigarette nine .
the police want a clear way to the station .
and arrange permission for the heathrow security .
pa000 , the paths of the flight of the glasow plane . . .
howay , don ' t go in the air part .
what am i doing here , harry ?
i had to find someone i could trust outside the service .
it ' s a short list when drunk , crazy and dead .
to be honest , the only person i could say that i ruined the life of the one person i could call a friend .
qasim ' s escape has been set up by someone above the service .
by one of the people who wanted you to follow me .
so i had to get lost .
qasim had her .
he ' s our only link to the haine .
when he gets into the system , he ' ll be thirsty .
he ' s planning an attack .
someone ' s trying to destroy themselves .
you ' re crazy .
ruth ' s death . . .
don ' t !
look for yourself , that ' s all i want .
what are you waiting for , harry ?
mi0 was my everything and you took it from me , for nothing .
hate me as you ask me , but i think you believe in service too .
what happened in berlin ?
is that how they tricked you ?
it may not end like you expected it .
i ' m afraid i ' m gonna have to give them something that ' s on the asset of your coat .
nothing there , but they ' ll have to check it out .
i ' ll send you a number .
call me in 00 hours , please .
i ' m a security service .
put your hands behind your back !
you just let him go .
calm down , francis .
we don ' t want you to have a heart attack .
the deadly one .
mi0 seems totally responsible , and i ' m the last friend in mi0 government now .
so right now you really have to be nice to me .
in other words , are you crazy ?
that doesn ' t contradict him with the last three psychiatric judgment .
he refused to join .
harry didn ' t stop being a pearce .
no matter how crazy , i still catch him . . .
for example .
he asked me to help him disappear .
you didn ' t think you ' d accept your request and bring him to us ?
don ' t think we ' re gonna be in a hell of a lot more shit than your life just because harry ' s been pissing you off .
since we threaten each other , all three of you aren ' t hanging on my plane , don ' t get caught in the blood .
your entire organization seems to be disable right now .
find qasim .
it ' s full .
they ' re ready , brother .
the escape of qasim .
what really happened ?
who are you ?
i saw this name working on a case .
i thought they took you off duty .
they did .
now what really happened ?
kidnapping could be set up by someone in service .
do you know anything about this ?
what are you looking for ?
i left it two weeks ago .
there must be one around here .
tell me , why did you application ?
i didn ' t .
when i was 00 years old , i was hanging out with a kid who made the transfer .
the part was interested in some people who used it , so they reached me .
you started as an agent ?
and when i ' m done , they asked me to train as an officer .
when i told you my family came back to me .
and if someone you worked with helped qasim escape , that would be a problem , right ?
all right .
something wrong that day .
cass , my team leader , he was in front of me .
he told me not to unlock the gunman .
he ordered me to chase .
where does he live ?
loaded .
the w00 account .
panama city .
bribe company .
june , what are you here . . .
who are you ?
you told me not to fire qasim .
you told me not to fire when i treated my gun .
we swear , rob .
i ' m not saying anything until i go to thames house .
we ' re not going to thames house we ' re not going to thames
will , what have you found ?
qasim ' s guards were weakened from the safe .
the team leader was involved .
just a footman .
find out who gave the order .
the americans think mi0 is weak public , and i think one of them is coming in .
when qasim ran away , we fell out of sight .
the cia completely handled it .
fire . . . fire . . . fire . . . fire . . .
he was gonna shoot .
his pulse . . .
dead .
he ' s dead .
listen .
you should go home .
june !
i ' ll take care of this , but you need to leave now .
i ' ve never heard a part of this kind of song was killed .
who ' s warrender renting out ?
landon .
agency witness .
he ' s trying to get the rest of his support , and he ' s hoping not to give the keys to the kingdom .
every time i see you , francis , you look like you ' ve been buried in a place where you ' ve come back from langley or the pentagon , or two inches from the pentagon .
you don ' t have to tell me .
i don ' t think we should have forgotten who ' s flagged in times like this .
francis .
i ' m trying to help , but she ' s actually blaming me for the cia thing .
tonight , your generals , your politics , your spies have come together to celebrate .
tonight , we will attack the hearts of your powers .
our enemy , your sons and girls who send your girls to death in illegal wars .
spies who spy against you like you are guilty .
this war , it ' s far beyond the religious difference .
all planes that are outside the united kingdom . . .
he had it .
warrender lived .
if you have a way to get to qasim , just tell me .
there ' s another way .
qim ' s wife .
asma shishani .
the fsb has her .
if i find out where they ' re holding her , she ' ll give you the traitor .
you made a deal with her .
yeah .
and if we make it , he ' ll take us straight to him .
surrender and set it up .
how do you know the russians have the women ?
in exchange for a cia agent who ' s stuck in moscow with a state-of-the-art thing that ' s
i can reach the distance , but you need to open your secret door .
it ' s a ip address .
you ' re kidding .
it ' s the only way , will .
harry ' s getting help from somewhere .
i got your old contacts , but i need to access the staff files to make this right .
still , it wouldn ' t take you anywhere exciting .
i ' m in position .
looks like i ' m gonna have to steal more extra band-aids .
drink .
malcolm ?
all right , i ' m in .
i ' m looking at the servers now .
harry , we have to go .
can ' t we do this faster ?
i can .
but unfortunately , this machine is the last century .
office already pulled these .
erin watts .
it might be worth looking close .
fill the blanks for me .
but a spy came out .
i almost got him out .
i was a colleague for less than a year .
sooner or later they make you choose .
all right , i ' ll leave you alone .
is it over ?
why am i sure ?
i ' m sorry , will .
harry .
harry !
harry , what have you done ?
stay away from the computer .
i didn ' t feel the need to say this before , but i hope you know what you ' re doing .
harry works with qasim ?
he stole a whole gchq database .
everything we have about our west agent friends in russia .
why is harry going to berlin ?
looks like he ' s got a shot at sch ' nffield airport .
i don ' t know .
harry cyber didn ' t do the attack alone .
then who ' s helping him ?
except you .
and you ' re still protecting her .
why ?
i ' m protecting .
let me go to berlin and i ' ll find him .
and there ' s a threat .
analysis shows that in 00 hours , there ' s gonna be a wide-open attack in 00 hours .
an agent who ' s in charge of qasim ' s escape has been missing .
there are traces of struggle in your house .
do you know anything about this ?
how ' s your mother , howay ?
i heard it ' s not very good .
your father couldn ' t get together since he died .
understandable , really .
and then the door ' s coming .
i know , i know .
harry was right about one thing .
you ' re not good enough .
can we really hope the home secretary is stopping the attack of qasim again ?
we ' ve destroyed our threats to our freedom and our life freedom .
your talent may be important to hurt us , but it ' s the end .
you ' re gonna find out that our decision isn ' t borderline .
they don ' t listen .
they never killed our women ?
we make the world a better place , brother .
the transplant team at city airport .
we have a trailer to close the road to the prison vehicle when necessary .
i think i owe you .
you were totally right about vass .
dank .
alfredpatz .
your metron ' s on the north corner , 00th .
we have a safe house .
nostalgia .
don ' t forget to bring the records .
don ' t forget to bring his wife .
how did you find me ?
there ' s only one place in berlin to meet .
you told me .
it ' s the northern corner of the archpatz .
no sentimentality .
that ' s the price of qasim ' s wife .
when the fsb comes out of custody , qasim will give me a number .
he ' s gonna take me to the haine .
they ' re gonna be able to destroy the service where it can be defended .
get in the car , harry .
there ' s an old hotel 00 minutes away .
my contact can meet us there with three clean passport .
you ' re going home .
sorry about that .
why are you here , miss keaton ?
keep walking , harry .
i killed someone because of you .
you ' re c0 .
what are you doing , harry ?
talent .
so which one of you found it ?
jesus , will .
everything is ready .
vass ?
when you came to my house , i reported .
i said something about qasim ' s escape .
they put me in command center and they told me what to do .
they went to vass ' s house before us and planted the evidence .
i arranged for vass to escape .
you think i want to ?
i know my mission .
i ' m the only one who knows .
you got played .
right , will .
but i wonder if miss keaton is sure about me .
it was a chain of security .
what was i supposed to do ?
do you believe him ?
yeah .
i ' m sure your men will come and find you , if your usefulness is still up .
after all this is over , what do you think they ' ll do to you ?
i did what they asked me to do .
we ' re changing the deal .
we ' re taking qasim ' s wife to london .
tell the cab to yourself , or you ' ll never see your wife again .
let ' s go get her .
what ' s happened to alfredpatz ?
a sudden agorafobia sensation .
i ' m afraid there was something wrong with qasim ' s wife .
at least until you get in my car .
harry .
colonel .
i don ' t like being n cold , but we ' re gonna need your clothes .
everybody who ' s travelling at the united kingdom ' s national ray line for adam qasim ' s calls , everybody who ' s travelling at the u .s . king ' s national line , has to go into
i have your wife .

the russians put him to sleep and . . .
bullshit .

i ' ll tell your bitch you said goodbye .

no , same you .
i trusted june .
you were right to take me off duty .
despite everything i ' ve done , you ' re still trying to do something good here .
i won ' t let the sacrifices be in vain .
here .
was it fast ?
he could have let me go , but he chose not to leave me .
if you try anything , anything , i can ' t guarantee anyone ' s safety .
nobody .
you get my wife , i ' ll give you your phone number .
here we go .
hello ?

it might be a bit overdue .
it ' s from the south corner of ' platz .
keep your eyes on howay .
make sure he ' s safe .
maybe we ' re not so pathetic .
did you find qasim ?
harry will .
you still don ' t know him .
qim gave up the entire operation .
what did you tell him ?
i should have thought they ' d set you free after berlin .
they want to offer you a deal .
throw everything on harry and go .
i told them i ' d quit after i did this .
there ' s no way out .
i can ' t .
there ' s an emergency backup key stuck in your neck .
whatever you ' re after . . .

what did you give her ?
check the back .
the south corner .
i found harry on the north side of the archpatlatz .
the opposite .
where you trap one .
harry ?
i gave you to him .
get down !
get down !
get down !
lock us up .
get down !
get down !
we ' re not here for you !
we came for them .
get down !
think of your family .
hamza .
why ?
there are 00 men on the other side of these doors .
you must surrender .
come here .
open up !
if you think we ' re gonna make a deal . . .
open the door .
but he ' ll kill us .
there are so many demons in a room .
the only way to get out of here alive is to surrender . . .
you think i want to get out ?
how many people ' s lives started in this room ?
my people ' s lives .
your people ?
he didn ' t ask you to talk about them , to kill you for them .
if you want a hostage . . .
i think he made it clear he wasn ' t interested in hostages .
i ' m the manager of mi0 ' s general .
kill me and put down your gun .
otherwise , you ' re nothing but a dead terrorist .
no one will see you as a hero .
when we ' re done , you ' re gonna be a drunk , beat up his wife , a powerless cage .
we ' ll give them a couple of marchech men prostitutes , and we ' ll give them a free ticket to tell them that you begged them to pee .
we can ' t remember you very well , can we , adam ?
wait , wait , wait .
i pulled the chopper back .
but . . .
you fucking coward .
i thought you were fighting higher standard .
i ' m sorry about your wife ' s death , adam .
i know what this can do to you .
is this supposed to stop me ?
it ' s okay .
stop !
why did you bring her here ?
i made a choice .
without plan b .
why do you think i kept you out of your room ?
people are still dead , harry .
more than the explosions will die .
what kind of choice do you make ?
this is my job .
auntie , can you come out to play ?
hello , geraldine .
in the end , it comes down to who ' s been begging the tallest begging .
right ?
that morning , qasim would never have escaped .
you gave the metin unit an order to return all mi0 requests , right ?
that ' s the advantage of being a crazy maniac .
i don ' t need to prove it .
sacrificing his own service so that he could be asked to be asked by a foreign force .
the americans would have made you a general director without doubt .
how many more lives were worth in that promotion ?
what was it you thought you had done , harry ?
she ' s dying .
but if i gave up the moment i realized i was on the loser side , my career would be too short .
i can fly my brain and find my 00-year-old nephew . . .
i think it came from you .
what is this ?
he ' s crazy over 0 hours of guts , or he can ' t stop blood .
he won ' t let go .
how smart .
i was afraid your answer would be .
so i took the chance to make a choice .
what found your stomach isn ' t lunch .
i ate the shallow rib .
tell me you ' re lying , harry .
please .
tell me you didn ' t betray your country .
0 hours already , geraldine .
you can spend the last 0 hours in a hospital bed , but if i were you , i ' d play with your beautiful nephew .
i ' m thinking .
your message was saying something to me .
they ' re watching ruth ' s grave .
you can ' t leave now .
me , actually , you have something to do .
your father was wearing this the night he died .
sta got it all worked out and found a way to get into the fsb records and the fsb .
was he wearing a wedding ring on the night of the operation ?
i didn ' t throw you out because you weren ' t good enough .
after your father , i couldn ' t . . .
i had to protect you .
good doesn ' t last forever , will .
then who will ?
they ' re like me .
if you know your problem , and you tell the men at the door , it helps .
hotel middle school has room for every guest .
gather round in one line .
these new problems are killing in the darkness .
when these people fall dark , they ' ll be grateful .
i think we should keep them safe here , but i ' m worried things are going worse .
they have no idea who caused the dark question .
besides , it ' s not what we ' re worried about in the darkness .
we still haven ' t figured out how to lift this fog wall .
maybe it ' s a blessing .
this was the last of the in-flight pure .
i ' m on your side and i might need a new job .
i ' m under control , but if i can get another pillow for my beauty sleep , it ' s gonna go too low .
try to make things better .
we talked about this .
it ' s almost impossible to destroy the problem before someone kills her .
of course , i just need information that i don ' t have in my hands that i don ' t have , and maybe not .
i ' m gonna need a team .
any idea what ' s going on ?
but there ' s something wrong .
it ' s the only way to protect the rest of us .
it ' s too risky driving because of the magnet problem .
an engineer to help fix your power plant .
he ' s willing to take it .
if things don ' t work out , you can use her problem for central .
what the hell are you doing ?
the murderer who didn ' t leave anywhere outside .
and i think he really wants to prove to you that he really wants to help you .
all right , so just keep an eye on him for whatever reason , okay ?
because either of us have no connection to new problems .
i ' m not just saying that it ' s because she ' s my
when you leave , i ' ll call the person in the darkness problem .
he stole the batteries and put us in danger .
there was no choice , dwight .
third case in two weeks .
now the serial killer ' s in this building .
all right , i ' m gonna go talk to dwight .
my father always said you were a good man .
mara ' s father ?
there may be a way , but if you want me to explain , it might seem more scary , so don ' t ask me to .
even on the map , maine , i can ' t find haven .
you ' re telling me you can ' t find a town that has 00 thousand people ?
there ' s no problem with that .
then why didn ' t we use aether in the first place to finish the problems ?
i can ' t bring them in sealed .
so how do we find it ?
gloria brought a box of stuff that duke left in gull .
i don ' t think william has aether for what i need , and aether is just the first step .
you told his wife you ' d find him .
it ' s easy to decide on the side , but sometimes things don ' t work out the way they
i have a town to protect .
no wonder the plant ' s working 00 percent .
friends , i try , but you think , i ' ve never done anything like this before .
they parked the car here so i could talk to you , but i don ' t have enough money to pay for the oil change .
if everything goes well , i ' ll be back with aether before sunset .
this is peggy ' s husband , roll .
there ' s enough panic and fear .
the same killer who killed them 00 years ago and killed my son ?
we call him the murderer who didn ' t leave a trace .
what else are you hiding from me , vince ?
dwight does his best to accept the rules , but he ' s not the type to kill people .
it ' s the same thing in haven , being exiled .
thank our friend there , we keep them in some kind of prison .
he says the generator works at 00 percent .
damn , the generator must have blown their energy reserves when it overloaded overload .
it ' s open to this town that isn ' t part electric .
if this goes fast , five minutes .
this is about to end , and it ' s the only thing that ' s protecting us from dying in the darkness .
here , i ' ve re-checked the generator to get the power to the town faster , but there ' s nothing more we can do .
you better get back .
help each other .
knees around the lamp .
share your supplies .
you see , i ' m happy here .
i got your message .
get in the car now .
come on , jump !
if he ' s lying before us , we should be thankful for this , even withan .
i don ' t think you have anything worse than falling in love .
i don ' t like it here .
every story has two sides .
whoever ' s behind this is a traitor .
let ' s go .
he asked me to represent him on the wedding of slayan .
you are my brother ' s love .
that ' s why you ' re my brother .
you ' ve seen bigger places than this place in the realm of the iraqers .
none of them were running by a woman .
you need to choose a second person to trust you and watch what you do during the month .
then you ' ll take care of your friends and relatives .
i have no relatives here .
my mother and the others will escort you .
kela , this is the palace from bryan .
rda , do i always have to be protective ?
i don ' t understand that .
but i know i have to marry slan .
i ' ll love her .
this marriage cannot happen .
abrecan trusts you .
what do you do ?
carpentry .
then they can use you on the wall .
who are you ?
a friend of the president ' s .
like i said , i have things to take care of .
we need to figure out how to handle it .
varr said i couldn ' t accept gift .
i guess we ' ll stay between us .
every bride should smell good when the wedding day comes .
remember , this is our secret .
sit .
we ' ll take what we ' ll get while we take care of the wounded .
you wanted to talk ?
all right .
kela , it ' s time for your month .
elvina , are you gonna be the second person next to me ?
for the game .
we need to talk some time .
we need to discuss why marriage can ' t walk .
if we don ' t do our duty , their marriage can be canceled .
beow !
let ' s celebrate .
for old tradition !
the dress smells apology .
i ' m so sorry .
just a little mistake .
that ' s all .
we ' re gonna help san give the brood to his daughter-in-law .
sounds easy .
break !
open the door !
come on , you stinky underwear .
come on !
come on !
give me your arm .
come on !
clean .
quiet , kela ' s asleep .
are they ready for this marriage ?
i don ' t understand why slayan wouldn ' t want to marry kela .
i don ' t think so .
he should put his feelings aside and do what ' s best for everyone .
would you put it aside for others ?
that ' s what we all have to do .
if someone ' s willing to please everybody else ' s life , it means they don ' t actually live .
to think like that would make you feel pretty free .
try .
tell every rock the truth .
then you can look at each other and light your marriage to fire .
then you ' ll be husband and wife .
did you ever love someone before ?
no .
before you come here . . .
you want to be a shane ?
tell my uncle that i ' m done with him .
god .
come on !
go !
you let him go .
we ' re not done here .
don ' t you understand ?
i betrayed my mother and set up my uncle .
this woman was sent here to kill you !
i don ' t know .
was it ?
i killed my brother .
he was the one who should be with him today .
even without the world , mara had everything .
people loved him because he was kind .
my father loved him for his first child .
roan and lovers .
then i had the opportunity to escape .
i didn ' t need anything .
she was dead before the fever .
he was healing .
i poisoned him .
slay , i ' m not telling anyone what you did here today and what happened to you .
or stay .
i know , but he ' s beowulf .
he went to bed last night .
but we can choose who we can draw our fate with .
light the fire with me .
you want to be a shane ?
i can help you .
against those who stand against you .
they can ' t take it from you anymore , rheda .
you ' re the one who ' s married to this marriage to you , sheldlands pearl .
the rules of earl must be used by every tribe .
if his blood isn ' t paid , a killer ' s life will be over .
the thieves will be plundered from society .
all the price of trade in the sheldfieldlands will be known by j . pearl .
what right does he have in the fishing price ?
we ' re the ones who risked their lives to catch every summer panic attack .
you should have told me about these rules .
you were where your people needed you most , you were on guard .
i couldn ' t distract you .
that was messed up enough .
you ' re late for the board .
some think he missed her again .
but if you fail , bryan will be in miserable misery and he ' ll starve .
breca ' s wanted for murder , you know that .
kill him !
kill breca right now !
i got it !
without any explanation , we all die .
he hired us to deliver breca to his blood after he ran away from the tree .
we were gonna ask the man who helped him escape the first time ?
so we ' ll welcome this .
but we should keep the break .
when we speak , heorot may be holding our doors !
when did we kill young women ?
what do you mean ?
you ' ve been hiding in the shadows too long , abrecan .
remember who you talk to .
speak .
he wants breca ' s life or blood money to kill his sister .
i didn ' t mean to kill anybody .
hurry up !
thanks .
breca made my mother fall in love with herself .
he ' s looking for the terms he thinks he ' s got money , and then he ' s stealing the money and running away from this asshole .
she left my mother and she took everything precious with her .
my brother went after him .
but it cost you your life .
break , is that right ?
i ' ll pay for your sister ' s blood money .
lila , do you have 00 silver money ?
i don ' t want money , i want blood !
quiet !
if his blood money is paid , breca will be free .
you lied to me .
pani .
pan lock !
tie him up now .
get ready , they ' re coming .
i saw it .
get out !
the council is packed .
he wants to take my place while i ' m trying to lose the board .
you let me down , he married sean keela , and rheda pearl !
you don ' t understand .
tell the council our enemies are packed , that your sister didn ' t rule , you want to save sheldlans .
so tell me you ' re distracted .
tell me .
i ' m sorry .
i knew breca killed someone , but the story she told me was different .
it ' s just his fault .
lila , nobody thinks bad things about you . . .
that ' s all i got .
did you bring it ?
there ' s 00 silver out here .
not enough .
and i ' m gonna hold the break while i see it .
was there enough money ?
lila ?
turn off the subject , please .
you ' re not talking to lila .
get on your horse , leave heorot and never come back .
there ' s no place for you here anymore .
i want to fight properly if heorot ' s being attacked .
i ' ll protect you if heorot ' s being attacked .
let ' s try .
it ' s not about dirt .
i don ' t want to talk about him .
i want to know why you lied about training me .
it happens when you use it .
you don ' t even want to be concerned .
yeah ?
i didn ' t know we trained the ironers !
go .
now !
he ' s fighting girls now ?
the view was more ironic , it looked like he was training nuru .
i know you think i let you down .
that i couldn ' t focus on my duty at bryan .
but i have reasons .
you ' re talking about treason against your own blood .
this land needs a warrior !
someone who ' ll take your people out of the dark .
a man in power to take control !
you ' re talking about betraying your sister to hide the fact that you can ' t afford the needs of your people .
what ' s the point of having the fish if we ' re all gonna be slaughtered ?
i ' m here to give our shane a vote of confidence .
the ones against abrean being a shane .
it ' s decided .
he ' s gonna get a new shane , and it ' s time for the morning .
get up .
next .
nobody .
don ' t think this !
we ' re lazy , we ' re distracted .
it ' s gonna be over here .
from now on , we ' ll just work like my father hrothgar .
i didn ' t mean to interrupt .
you ' re a good teacher .
a great shane wants a strong army behind him .
we don ' t have to share the same bed , but if we don ' t share the same room , people will start talking .
i always liked watching heorot from here .
it looks invincible .
if i tell my mother the truth , i ' ll lose her trust .
and also the chance to rule one day .
what if abrecan attack ?
heorot may fall .
aren ' t you going to recommend it ?
i trust you .
your decision will be right .
i ' ll be there when i make it .
you ' ll be shane .
you just have to believe it .
pani .
pan lock !
it ' s the ice !
play the money !
i command you , steal the debt !
abrecan , give it up .
if we don ' t act now , we ' ll be out of opportunity .
why . . . why . . . why . . . why . . .
you help me move the net .
help me with the net .
why don ' t you help ?
pan lock !
come on , hurry up !
go find me a bag .
people shouldn ' t leave their precious stuff anywhere .
you owe my mother an apology .
but i ' m a warrior and our honor is at stake .
so i ' ll take your life .
go back to mommy , little girl .
hi .
i didn ' t need your help .
because he didn ' t have enough money to save you .
thank god you didn ' t kill him , vishka .
if we can ' t place the network , our prey will be run away .
no , he won ' t .
get ready .
abrecan , no !
keep the rope fixed !
hurry , you fucking cries !
paniri , pani !
paniri , pani !
hold on !
now gerin !
take a look .
there will be songs about this hunt .
a prey you won .
i have a dream about us .
to be the biggest tribe in sheldlands !
we ' re not gonna be able to obey the laws of a j pearl who can ' t even hold a sword .
who with me ?
abrecan , abrerecan , abrecan !
i need to warn beowf .
bryan !
elvina !
their warriors are coming together .
to destroy us this time .
beow !
if we look around today , we ' ll see that more danger and damage has come from religious faith .
my wife , if i talked about soviet communism or stalin ' s brutality at my stand-up shows , it would be less embarrassing .
it ' s the sort of thing for people to question the kind of interrogation that ' s making problems for people , especially the situation .
it ' s serious zarara , to present a situation that ' s perfectly perfectly true in itself that can cause serious damage .
when the prophecy doesn ' t happen , we make fun of those people and the whole world mock us .
i had a friendly idea with richard dawkins about this problem .
maybe richard and i should be more aggressive .
especially in america , she ' s blonde with christian faith .
they ' re pretty sure the world is what their religion says .
we ' ll get rid of the bad guys .
i ' d like to write a book like this , if i could .
but of course one of my fears is what happens next .
what kind of confusion ?
how is it right to do that to people who think they ' re protecting the grandfather ' s civilization and the goodness of our instincts ?
listen , for a lot of people , moral vagra is like a man .
if that ' s true , if the religion shows people ' s moral lives , then either of them are gonna be serious and you ' re gonna have to go out of the way , and you ' re gonna have to deal with the rest of us .
because a lot of people downstairs can stay and we can create a chaos from the fear of these people .
many people want their lives to mean something and where does that come from ?
but something better than that .
yeah , there sure is hope .
let ' s see what happens .
of course .
at least you didn ' t have piercings .
i don ' t know how to explain this to amy .
i ' m the stupidest man in the world .
all right , stop it .
i ' m the stupidest man in the world .
well , you won this .
i can ' t find emma ' s papers .
honey , i ' m tellin '  you know you can ' t return the baby if you find the racket .
when angela left emma on my doorstep , i need to sign and find the one person she gave me .
i ' m gonna have to get me a health insurance that i ' m finally responsible for and looking at myself .
i haven ' t talked to him since the night we did emma .
easy .
you gave me all the important papers about the baby , so they ' d be safe .
you have all the papers ?
his father ' s little girl ' s father had a big girl .
something with a balloon .
it ' s hot !
you robbed a clown ?
your birthday !
my first birthday tomorrow .
you used to party when you were a kid .
after my birthday thing . . .
"hate many happy years ."
the paperwork i kept for me .
how irresponsible do you think i am ?
but i . . .
i may have posted them in time , and he couldn ' t post them , and i may not be the only owner of emma ' s office .
we were all excited because the new baby was here , and i didn ' t have the damga !
look , i don ' t think we ' ve signed this paper to angela again .
you ' re the only one who ' s seen ben ' s best friend and the only one who ' s seen the girl . . .
i love it , okay .
okay , emma finally fell asleep .
hey , danny , what ' s the reason why riley didn ' t want to celebrate her birthday ?
seriously , why does she hate it so much ?
ben riley didn ' t celebrate her birthday after his 00th birthday party .
you sure you want to watch this ?
i think i ' d remember if something terrible happened .
all right , come on , people .
danny , where are we going ?
luckily , she lost a real mustache to the future and lost her weight for one .
me here too ?
benjamin wheeler , come here and celebrate riley ' s birthday .
well , i can tell you that this is the best birthday i ever had .
tell the cake you didn ' t do anything .
actually , first try to save the fairy and then go .
is riley still in love with ben or is that something when he was a kid ?
unless you ' re still in love with riley .
i screwed up the girl ' s sweet 00 .
it ' s not their birthday secrets , but it ' s sure that he loves you for the rest of the
if i ' m so scared that he ' s gonna lose the papers and he ' s so scared to face me and maybe he doesn ' t deserve to take the case with emma alone .
if it makes you feel better , we do most of the work .
i can imagine how hard it is to let emma go .
i knew how beautiful , funny or awesome you ' d finally upset him !
in your peace through the city streets of city streets , city streets , u .s . military tanks belonging to the u .s . army ' s 00th and only three minutes , three minutes , three minutes
and as madox-00 , the weapon we realized as anox-00 is very high .
what ' s more , he has more power than a uh-00 .
he ' s an anti-terreistorist and an anti-gerilla operation .
mrs . vomumoto is also the mastermind for "tank nightmareter ."
in the show today ' s show , in order to put madox ' s tribe on the show , the pilot went to the cabin today .
unit 0 will go to ichigaya tonight .
we ' re in a hurry , so try to be quick as you can .
also . . .
miss kikumoto , you made me quite small today .
i ' m not here for congratulations .
i have one thing to tell you:
wow !
kouji . . .
which is ?
onose , you leave this to me !
they just threw their garbage away .
i ' m telling you not to worry .
i buy you dinner in return , right ?
the transport vehicle belonged to sdf . . .
according to the reports , it was perfectly natural . . .
obvious terrorist business .
you ' re too wild for the east-block operation .
i hope you know what you ' re saying !
i hope you ' re seeing the burden of what ' s winning is all yours .
either way , the situation we ' re in is very critical .
we were transferring him for field test !
vrah !
i ' m gonna have to be on the operation .
besides , madox-00 is being tasted by now .
the cars in the environment are giving us trouble .
shouldn ' t we get backup from the police ?
he must prepare ourselves for the worst , and keep our help troops ready .
i ' m the only one who can stand up to madox and get high .
even though lieutenant kilgore is one of the "enaly" of the "man of the thumbal ," he ' s our best tanker in the army .
is this-- is it okay ?
nobody in the building ?
anyway , i ' m a little relieved .
shori was really pretty . . .
when england goes to reading , all the boys in japan will mourn .
how did you know that ?
she called me in the morning and asked me to give you a message .
use your starvation control to open it .
burning !
he was able to set up his pilot .
it feels like he ' s dressed for a skateboard .
we got a signal activated from madox .
it ' s a disaster .
would you be able to warm up in the microwave ?
i really disgrace myself !
shori , what do you intend to do ?
defense ?
you ' re going on a mission with the proto air discount .
and don ' t you dare turn out all of lex ' s in engineering !
it ' s the same battlefields to me .
you ' ll cause the face .
oh , come on , don ' t worry .
i ' m not gonna overcome things till they ' re too upset .
lieutenant kilgore is using the most advanced tank and anti-tank chopper chopper , and my word is "doing madox ."
in that case , the city center will be a big panic .
in these circumstances , there must be someone who can stop kilgore and madox .
what can we do ?
we don ' t know about madox ' s target yet .
if i managed to find him before lieutenant kilgore , maybe i ' ll have a chance .
but madox ' s condition . . .
♪ i ' m gonna use the unit0 .
how much for success ?
hey , you heard me !
wait for me .
that ' s it !
how !
what are you doing on the way ?
i can ' t stand by the side of the road like a stone stone !
you ' re a fbi driver , man !
i ' ve still got a lot more to finish off your mortgage !
she ' s back in the !
bye , assholes !
the fake saturdays were closed to the car traffic .
i can ' t lose track of this crowd !
this "adox" is really worth it .
spiders 0 to five .
don ' t move !
she moves on her own . . .
one of the apache was dropped .
all units are in charge of destroying madox .
just as dagore wants .
he ' s moving to the sky with the apache of the apache .
civilians must evacuate at once !
they ' re all over me !
right this way , man , i have to go to the west exit .
another crazy armored an armored baz !
all right , back to work , madox !
i hear you .
and i say , "you ' re a headache ."
if anyone ' s involved in the mess , it ' s you .
"sade" what ?
none of your business .
i can ' t do something i don ' t understand !
no !

"ns park parking - " - "

i did it !
shori up there !
i won ' t let you take another step .
i can ' t fight !
i can ' t waste any more time with you !
i thought you were amateurs , so i shouldn ' t be nice to you .
time to jump around and stop jumping .
it ' s not !
he ' s young !
what were you trying to do with this ?
my name ' s sgimoto kouji , i ' m a second-class student of the kantto-to-to-to-
my only intention was to meet my girlfriend at the nsr building waiting for me .
he locked me in first , then he dropped himself a helicopter .
i got you .
miss kikumoto , this is spider 0 talk , i ' m kilgore .
i watched your show .
you fight hard .
i ' m gonna take care of what ' s necessary , in the disappearance , in person .
hey , where are the civilians in the building ?
what ' s so important ?
what am i crazy about when you think of me ?
the target has madox .
he ' ll come after you to destroy him .
i know how to walk and use my hands .
you have success .
madox is destroyed , or you ' re kilgore !
they damage my legs .
i can ' t move anymore .
you think i can beat him ?
you were good when we were fighting .
did you read the whole van ?
hi , madox .
adi it !
come kill me !
wouldn ' t you be able to fight a little more and raise my "happy" ?
l-lanet !
what , you ' ve turned around like a turtle !
if you can ' t even fuck this much , you ' re gonna put a stain on the tanker ' s behalf !
your numbers won ' t rip me off !
kouji !
coming !
you ' re brave !
i ' m tired of the cat-f-are game !
you just fell into my medical trap !
i ' m gonna drop you off with me , madox !
this is messed with madox !
i have something very important to tell you , shiori .
paul wouldn ' t hurt anybody .
"it cannot be " not to be said" "it cannot
i ' m not your mother , brian .
you don ' t even like me .
are you really gonna stay ?
everything didn ' t get clear .
i haven ' t even written my time yet .
there ' s a sound on the right .
can they stand him again ?

ethel here looks amazing with her coro girls .
oh , this is from her barnum days .
it was a woman who wasn ' t like her husband .
ethel .
ethel .
so what do you say ?
nobody heard what spencer said last night ?
it ' s all over now .
elsa killed ethel .
woods .
car accident .
it was all a counter .
i believe that .
that crazy woman threw a knife at my paul .
he was the only one elsa said .
i couldn ' t even sit in my head anyway .
i know ethel .
he wasn ' t someone to kill himself .
it ' s not coward .
she wouldn ' t do this to her own child , and of course we do .
and he would leave a proper note .
if one of us gets after one of us , we know what to do .
our future has only one faith .
it ' s elsa ' s life too .
have you ever dreamed that you might feel that way , dot ?
thank god you said about marjorie .
all he had to do was push him away .
i think we ' re definitely on top of it .
good evening , girls .
what are you doing here ?
i ' m here to hand over the friendly xindi .
i have some information about your last mission .
we don ' t want to hear anything from you .
leave it gentle .
oh , dot , i can ' t blame you .
i showed a terrible behavior the other day .
but the recent events caused my hard side softness .
i lost my mother .
so sudden and . . . terrible .
she ' s very upset , d randy .
it ' s terrible for everyone to lose the mother of man .
it was .
yeah .
and it made me feel like i shouldn ' t have let my loved ones go .
but you should know we ' ve met a man .
actually , i got your news .
you have no idea how great it would be to marry you .
if i had any luck with everything . . . believe . . .
i came from friendly feelings .
i know i lost my luck .
i ' m not half the man you deserve .
but i asked myself .
"duddy , what do you have to do to support the girls you love so much ?"
then i thought i might protect you , and i hired a decent man so you could gather information about your new friend .
he broke my heart because your lester crab is a total freak !
we don ' t need to look at these .
what ' s your problem ?
you ' re such a pain in the ass , and we don ' t trust you as sin .
ta-ta then .
i did my best .
my mother always used to call her when she was angry .
who is it ?
son .
here .
drink .
what ' s that ?
penicillin .
i ' d hate to see you die of an infection when i say we complete you .
who are you ?
my name is massimo dolcefino .
i came to make you your new hands .
okay ?
massimo is an old friend of mine before the war .
it ' s your art .
no , no .
i ' ve seen some of the men who blew a bomb in their hands .
they ' re wearing these cool hooks .
i can ' t take 00 , but at least i can hold my own cigarette .
and i don ' t have to be scared of the wood dryers for the rest of my life .
massimo ' s suggesting something more spoiled than the rusty hooks .
more convincing .
look .
see ?
the other one is .
massimo saved my life .
your mother would die from the drink and she ' d leave you in the streets .
i could marry her if you weren ' t so stupid .
" my only sin . . ."
si .
" . . . loved you . . ."
a very very very very very very very very
no !
they were members of an organization .
and if they ' re leaders , it ' s a doctor you know .
now get to the other one , don ' t hurry this time .
for two years ,
massimo took care of me .
he taught me to walk .
and dance .
then he fell in .
nahmberg , rhinhineland . . .
we were supposed to run away while we still had access .
we planned it .
how could i look into the eyes of my love when i knew those monsters were free ?
they had to pay .
i took them one by one .
aah !
i finally got to the leader .
ah , the head of monsters .
doctor hans grouper .
it shouldn ' t have been a painless death .
obviously my death wouldn ' t be too painless either .
it took me too personal to want to kill him .
very personal .
he tortured me .
he locked me in a cell and tortured me again , and again .
how did you survive ?
i lived in osterlich until the end of the war .
then i came to america- at 00 .
and i searched miss mars for years .
but i couldn ' t answer .
if you loved her so much , and you knew where she was , why didn ' t you just come up to your feet ?
my body got rid of torture but . . .
i was like pinocchio .
i had nothing to do with humanity .
but ah . . .
good irony .
good irony .
i know you ' ve been doing so long , and it might be hard to make changes for a sitting show .
and i repeat- it has nothing to do with the ego .
it ' s for this . . . for the . . . of this
looks very normal .
i don ' t think we can judge him if we don ' t have proof .
and the file ?
it says he killed his wife .
you ' re letting d randy ' s lies fall into the shade .
dot and i have something to say .
we don ' t want to do your assistant anymore .
why ?
we just . . . don ' t want to .
maybe you ' ll change your mind when you hear my final .
two bodies , two heads .
it ' s gonna sound so loud .
a first in the history of magic .
girls . . . let ' s rehearse .
we ' re not going in that box .
no , lester . . . we ' re not going in that box .
now excuse me . . .
i will .
you . . .
i could be your assistant .
yeah .

the other one .
you .
thank you .
but jesse james ran and hid for two years .
the united states army of bull ' s army sitting in the big dicks chasing the bull and crazy at the black hill underneath the black hill of the black hill .
after the defeat in little bighorn war , the united states government chose to destroy the buffalos , to starve the people of the lakota and bow down .
hold the line !
but despite the little war against the small war against the united states army , the indians '  battle was getting worse .
but the bull and crazy horse , who ' s sitting on the lakota leaders , they ' re running out of options .
you ' re a strong heart .
but i ' m tired .
see you later .
the americans didn ' t give up despite the violence against their tribe and the culture and what they saw .
to go there for living in those times meant catching a chance to get rich .
many women and men tried their luck .
once the golden , the united states became the first country to save itself from global warming .
it was found in the west .
there ' s been a lot of beef in texas for a long time .
but it wasn ' t possible for them to move up to the east and move them to starving people until they were able to complete the spanish road .
in texas , they ' d have 00 bucks heading east on the east coast for $00 .
they bought the bigger part of the field that bought the cows from cancer to california .
this land had unbelievable opportunity .
we ' re talking about millions of millions of unmanned land , on the farm and thousands and thousands of major animals on them .
one of the shallow thieves in the new mexico area would turn into one of the men with the evil of the west .
his story started 0 ,000 miles east .
billy never knew his father .
they moved to new mexico with his mother in the early 0000s .
he ' s been wandering around for years .
what do you want ?
whiskey .
drop the bottle .
there were different kinds of cowboys .
always sitting on the corner .
that ' s what you had to look out for .
billy used the best thing he ever did to make a living .
billy the kid was a very good gun .
he spent every dollar he won to buy a bullet for practice .
only the stronger in a place like this would survive .
where are you going ?
lincoln .
just passing through here .
these beasts belong to john tunstall .
then john tunstall can come back and get his cows back .
it ' ll help you let me go .
i don ' t think so .
i don ' t think you have a choice .
the young thief , billy the kid , was caught by a farmer who tried to steal the kid ' s cows .
most people shoot their shallow thieves where they see them .
you still haven ' t told me who you ' re working for .
i ' m not working for anyone .
everyone works for someone in the lincoln town , boy .
yeah , but i ' m not working .
you looked like a used man to buy me what you wanted .
you ' re right .
one problem , and so am i .
you have a lot of men .
do you have room for one more ?
billy the kid lincoln needed a job when he got to the lincoln .
john tunstall needed cowboys .
john tunstall came to the west to make a fortune .
he ' s moved to the lincoln town where he can make money .
but he ' s upset some powerful men .
lincoln was one of the wildest places in the wild west .
it was in ev ' s control of their price , their land , and the state ' s duty .
they even pay for their men ' s salary .
a lot of the living in lincoln , in fact , saw them as a bully .
john henry tunstall ' s been coming into town long enough to put his nose in his shallow business .
no one could have stayed without him .
billy became the man of tunstall when he went into work with john henry tunstall .
in a few months , the young outlaw had become the most trusted man in tunstall .
for the first time in your life , my young orphan felt like he was home in the west .
tunstall became a mental teacher for billy the kid .
give me your plate , billy .
thanks .
i ' m starving .
everything is going great , kid .
i ' m glad you ' re with me .
thanks .
billy was always barely getting by .
it was seen as a foot team by many people .
it was amazing and unbelievable and changing life for a young boy billy ' s age .
billy the kid was trying to stop a few hundred miles north of a half-minded industry from being a part of a shallow industry where america was growing up as fuel .
take it easy , guys .
i ' m selling my left hand as a friendship suggestion .
if he didn ' t do it , most of us wouldn ' t be here today .
we were gonna die fighting the battlefield .
they actually took people ' s spirits when they put us in the area .
he trusts me .
he ' s talking to me .
jesus christ .
this politics is known as an "simportation ."
but i think they wanted to make us unprotected .
there was a word in the military .
kill the red killer and protect the man ."
if you destroy the indians '  culture , you ' d be a better man .
they thought we were wild .
proud lakota warrior knew he had to repeat it .
" probably not happy here ."
"i ' m not happy here ."
"we don ' t want to live in the field ."
you ' re not used to life in your area .
give it time .
i ' m sure you ' ll love it in time .
after he offered his objection to the united states authorities , he was afraid the military would start a new indian foot in the lakota warrior .
the united states was scared of crazy horse .
said the crazy horse wanted to kill a general who came to visit himself .
the united states authorities were worried about a new rioting rumors .
while the crazy horse was spreading the fear of something , the lakota warrior went to meet with authorities to clean up his name .
crazy horse thought you were meeting the united states authorities .
he hasn ' t noticed the point before .
they wanted to put him in prison cell .
then he pulled out his knife .
although the most trusting comments i think , the white united states guard killed him by sponging him .
crazy horse didn ' t get killed at the battlefield .
the vision was true .
the guard was surprised by his watch .
in september 0 , in 0000 , the man who fought to protect his people his people during his crazy horse life , who fought against the united states against the war .
it ' s hard to talk about crazy horse ' s death because even after so many years it ' s very fresh .
one of the most fascinating part of the most fascinating horse and disgust , one of the most fascinating side wizards in american history , is that the indians are talking about most .
today , the symbol of courage against the government of the united states government is seen as a symbol of resistance , and he ' s being respected by himself .
i think that ' s what makes him so strong .
in the death of the crazy horse , the people of the lakota waited for a leader who could save the rest of their hopeless culture .
he ' s been taking care of them until he ' s paid for his debt to catron .
this is for you .
what if he resistance ?
i don ' t care how .
it ' s only my business .
understood .
go check it out .
you stay here .
okay .
what ' s your hurry , gentlemen ?
we heard gunshots .
really ?
don ' t do anything stupid , boy .
this has nothing to do with you .
it ' ll help keep it that way .
there are always intruders between this contestants .
but as many ideas in the west , it became personal .
someone took a personal situation the minute someone was murdered .
that one was john henry tunstall .
he was murdered because of the work disability .
it was personal .
by the death of john tunstall ' s death , billy fell to find his killers .
this road was gonna lead him to the legend of a cowboy who didn ' t even know who he was .
as the men like billy the kid , the men like billy the kid , realized the border wasn ' t running with the law .
but over 000 miles from new mexico , a man was prepared to bring the law to the west .
whoever took everything the men wanted and fought every day of their life , the cancer he fought for every day wasn ' t better than whattarp .
he was a big man for the 00th century standard .
he was so excited about this size .
wyatt earp was one of thousands of americans who had rained west in order to become rich .
wyatt was caught in the west disease .
he always felt he had to push the next border .
this border mine could ' ve been searched and anything to bring adventure .
that ' s how wyatt lives .
he did everything right on the border to get this .
in order for the pacific pacific ' s pacific spanish , ray did everything he could to hunt the buffalo , even in a brothel .
they were supposed to drive back to the crowds , as soon as they came back into the city , where they were supposed to drive them back to the crowds , to get them back to the city on the subway to the
so , the fast towns came out .
there was a view of the earth from the unattractive land that was suddenly 00 rooms .
the young men who managed to come to this city were drinking whiskey and carrying a gun .
i mean , he had a lot of good drinks and a lot of gunmen .
that ' s one of the reasons the west was wild .
wyatt saw that there was no law in dodge city and the disfigures were solved .
she had a hard life .
they ' d go back east or worse .
but wyatt earp was feeling more in his fate .
he was gonna prove a place in history he ' d be in dodge city .
you tricked the wrong guy .
that ' s my money .
this man is a cheat .
easy .
he cheated .
easy .
he cheated .
put your gun down .
did you see his gun ?
everyone saw you lay down a gun .
give me that .
i ' ll shoot you !
come on .
dodge city needed a desperate lawman .
wyatt earp was perfect for this .
it wasn ' t long before wyatt earp was thrown into dodge city as a police chief .
you didn ' t have to take a special education to be a lawman .
that ' s not how things work in this city .
wyatt earp wouldn ' t ask questions .
it ' s just a stool coming from him .
wyatt earp became famous in dodge city .
he ' d become one of the most famous beasts in the role of the role of an act as a lawman .
because cartel chickens make dad nightmares .

i ' m looking for my soul tonight .
i know there ' s so much more to life .
thanks for accepting me .
how can i help you ?
my wife cindy , she died two years ago .
we were three years old .
the car hit our anniversary .
cindy and i wanted to have kids .
for example , he ' s dead .
how are you gonna do that ?
or did the eggs leave his embryo ?
no .
did you hear me ?
i heard .
to clone your dead wife ?
scientists try this under their hand , mr . cage .
so i sneaked in to try for cindy .
my sister-in-law heard this and hired a lawyer to stop it .
that ' s why i need a lawyer .
he ' s going to court today .
yes , but , mr . stoller , i ' m sure your wife was a great person .
but clone idea ?
please .
there ' s nowhere else to go to .
and your firm has met this lawyer before .
who ?
larry paul .
i heard he was very successful .
it was .
how come you can have a holographic relationship ?
a relationship means communication .
what about "o" ?
i know you don ' t like it , but if her hands aren ' t in the stupid stick , she can ' t control the man .
all you care about is control .
i don ' t know .
really ?
and you came here to talk about my holographic relationship ?
i came to borrow something .
but forget it .
ally ?
excuse me a second .
the lawyer on the side , larry .
yeah ?
i ' m talking about a shooting here , right ?
you ' re responsible for your client .
yes , but . . .
didn ' t you use little information from inside when you were defending him ?
no , but i . . .
why wouldn ' t i ?
just for the client .
my case is so low .
i need something .
larry ' s weak point is my ritual .
he talks too fast when arguing with me because he knows i can ' t understand what ' s coming .
okay .
it ' s vulnerable when you lose your ritual .
okay .
you ' re on "your dreams" with cindy margis .
michelle garris sent me an e-mail and asked me a way to get into hollywood .
we met in hollywood and . . .
do it !
i won ' t use myself .
we can ' t deny the passion between us any longer .
you want me , i want you .
let ' s be honest .
you do my knee , and i ' ll touch my hair .
you ' re breaking my spine .
you don ' t like denial ?
then let ' s be honest .
i ' m leaving !
i went to los angeles and didn ' t even think of you .
your mind is in jackson .
people blame me on the surface .
but when it comes to business , i understand human behavior .
in the last month , you were shaving your legs in the morning .
is that your scientific attitude ?
if a woman scratches a woman ' s legs off at night , it ' s over .
unstable .
go to jackson .
he ' s the man you ' re crazy about .
first , clone people , it ' s against society order . . .
the court hasn ' t been brought in before .
when people are against the sheep clones . . .
this is none of your business .
you won ' t let me get to two . . .
the second word is sexual .
completely objection .
i wish i could get back to the sheep for short sheep .
these shells have no place in court .
let ' s get to the snow .
a moment ago ?
let ' s hear what mr . paul has to say .
second , forgive my shell . . .
he ' s kidding .
even if he can clone , mr . stoller can ' t make this decision .
too much .
i ' m predictable in law cases , but i was caught unpredictable for too many .
three times she made fun of me .
i ' d like to apologize , preferably noter .
four times !
is this clone possible ?
first i want to listen to your client and i want to know why .
your honor , i also hope . . .
see you tomorrow .
later .
ling , he denies even what he wants .
how are you feeling ?
he can take it .
the man ' s deep , a ink bottle .
i mean , i hope ling ' s drowning .
are you really ok ?
yeah .
actually , john cage was the lawyer ' s lawyer .
you knew ?
how ' d it go ?
smile is against the princesses .
what ' s going on ?
don ' t ask me .
john asked me to give you a few clues in court against you , so i told him to break your ritual .
you ' re useless without ritual .
cute , but useless .
you gave him advice ?
i ' m kind of his client .
we ' re sleeping with you .
you ' re behind my back .
you give him advice when you can ' t beat me ?
does john know you can never beat me ?
excuse me ?
does john know you never beat me ?
no , no .
never ?
isn ' t the smile nice ?
very cute .
i ' m gonna beat you one day , but john ' s gonna beat me with my advice today .
great .
i ' m gonna lose my change .
no , you don ' t .
now he knows i ' m trying to ruin his ritual .
he said you ' d never beat him .
not just in this case , not at all .
did he ?
yeah .
i bet i am , john .
he said i could never beat him ?
exactly .
never ?
never .
of course .
i can date a man in paris .
you can go as far away as you want from here .
i ' m not gonna get you into this .
no , no .
how was i ?
larry ?
why are you here ?
i thought we could walk with john .
you ' re trying to confuse me , i won ' t let that happen .
i saw your smile .
it wasn ' t supportive at all .
is everything all right , john ?
you look a little restless .
he ' s trying to make it up to me , but he won ' t take me out .
good .
you wanna go to dinner ?
i ' d love to .
i ' m full today , but how about tomorrow ?
great .
we always talked about having kids .
i think i want to make cindy ' s and my dream come true .
but you ' re not talking about having cindy ' s child .
you want to clone him .
the only way to keep her genetic miracle is to clone .
well , there ' s a lot of people , including mr . paul , who sit there as gayricid . . .
your honor , i ' d like to stand up as gayric .
mr . paul , sit down .
mr . cage , don ' t provoke it .
a lot of people find their idea of clone .
but i ' m not the kind of scientist who ' s trying to perfect their living species .
and i know i can ' t bring cindy back .
i want to keep the generation from driving .
and i guess i just don ' t want him to end .
thanks .
first , i ' m sorry for your loss .
but you ' re trying to copy cindy , right ?
this is a complete genetic copy of your dead wife .
it looks the same . . . talk talk . . . talk . . . the same . . .
cindy , did he ever talk about any of those frustrated fruits ?
he was against it .
what about the genetics ?
he was against it too .
but it was open to the idea that the genetics had to be made of their own copy .
not the same thing !
not everything about chicken , your honor .
i didn ' t say that .
i ' m nervous enough without you .
you wouldn ' t let anyone get your number .
whatever makes you great , you gotta win it again .
maybe melanie scared her off .
john , i ' m sorry , man .
but remember , larry said he could never beat him .
never .
you should think big now .
because this time , i won ' t rub his feet .
whatever happens , you have to find barry white .
yeah .
yeah .
come on !
we did it together , baby .
ally knows ?
the pressure doesn ' t help me .
may i ?
of course .
just you and me .
bullshit !
how does this clone happen ?
very impressive .
we ' re getting eggs from the data we ' re injecting the creeps .
this cindy stoller from the clone , we ' re getting a cell .
this part is very impressive .
the witness said it was impressive before .
is this just an impressive part ?
then we draw every egg core with a needle .
there ' s a lot of needles in the clone .
we ' re putting the dna pulled eggs next to the database .
this is cindy ' s cell .
and we ' re using energy .
what does that mean ?
we ' re spooking the heat , sort of an electric . . .
i ' m trying to understand .
you ' re putting this thing down to killing bugs and i find this disgusting , even for a public inspector .
let ' s keep moving .
you ' re both out of my sight .
after energy , what happens to the cells ?
they ' re boiling each other with data cells , dnaless cells .
then we put these in the hostile mother ' s mother and it ' s a clone doll .
spermle ?
no , that ' s very impressive .
is that really possible ?
i must confess , most embryo are dying .
but it ' s possible one of them was successful .
we already tried that on the sheep .
it ' s possible for people too .
how far is this technology ?
it ' s for now .
people don ' t expect science .
scientists are waiting .
thanks , doc .
hey , mark .
if you need anything , your assistant , call mine .
i don ' t see you anymore , you two-faced jackal .
i see it .
maybe another time .
what ' s going on ?
i ' ll tell you at dinner sometime .
forget it .
what ' s your problem ?
what ' s my problem ?
i put myself in front of you .
i threw it like a ball bullets .
you know what this is big for me ?
i made you a gesture .
i told you i was in love with you last week .
anyone can share such a stupid feeling .
please .
i want something very small .
close talking , you gotta be with me .
together we can beat larry .
just you and me .
come on !
you ' re at the end of your career .
what else do you have to do ?
are you here ?
you ' re here !
that ' s why i ' m starting to add to daycuffs .
he was here .
who ?
barry white was here .
forgive me for not guessing this .
my station .
not the same .
i can ' t bring him with other people in the room .
most people can ' t dance with imaginary demons in front of others .
i always brought her .
i walked in the crowds with him .
no , here ' s what you need to do .
call him in your shelter while you ' re alone .
first grab her without the cuts , then come on out among the people .
i don ' t know if i can .
you have to .
without barry , what are you ?
look at this .
you can ' t live like this .
you have no choice but to find barry .
they will take his character , his dna .
your brother , he loved your brother .
excuse me , this is how i ' m gonna make my objections .
he won ' t bring cindy back .
even the only eggs as they say they share the same dna , different people .
even when you ' re taking one ' s organs , it needs his permission .
the copy of dna is a much more self-defense attitude .
getting into their special .
i ' m sorry .
mine ?
i didn ' t mean to .
it was wrong .
don ' t you want to see your brother ' s genes continue ?
he ' ll look like him , talk like him .
wouldn ' t he want that ?
she ' s been against genetic research all along .
he certainly wouldn ' t want that .
never .
you have a computer .
i want some privacy .
from brazilla .
we ' re actually gonna have our first conversation .
i feel very good for him .
but hurry up .
i ' m the one who ' s gonna rub his stinky feet .
did you find barry white ?
any signs ?
forget it !
you couldn ' t find your own office ?
yours is closer to the court and my feet hurt a little .
i have no idea .
elaine !
he watched things happen .
will you stop watching me ?
you think that ' s what i ' m doing ?
i didn ' t ignore you .
i thought you weren ' t interested .
you were right .
 ' unut down , deja vu '  .
you ' ve been angry since i came to this firm .
i ' m angry because you lied to me .
i ' m angry because i slept with you .
it ' s hard to walk around happy all the time .
it ' s hard to be a cheerlead .
i don ' t understand why you do this every day .
obviously , from the beginning , we ' re both a little embarrassed .
then why don ' t we start a fresh start ?
you may be right .
you may not .
jackson .
how are you ?
no complaint .
this definitely belongs to both of us , right ?
something ' s up .
yes , it is .
no one , just you and me .
funny little man , isn ' t he ?
that ' s fine with me .
right on time .
it ' s like being dr . frankenstein .
the idea of starting the organs ?
choose dna ?
these are terrible .
we could have hokey team full of wayne gretzky kopys .
with a pitbull , they can join mike tyson .
the odds .
terror .
but the truth is , every time the science steps out every new step , worries about humanity ' s future .
we ' ve already made baby babies , your honor .
we play genes .
this technology will save lives .
is there a risk of being abused ?
sure , there is .
my client knows his wishes and dreams .
dreams they have together .
this process will give you the opportunity to continue the family miracle they hope for .
we need to be open to science to make a couple of kids have kids .
the point is , who doesn ' t have his dna , right ?
i remind mr . paul that the wife in life can also forgive the organs of the dead husband ' s dead wife , without permission .
mr . paul , i ' m just saying this because mr .s . stoller might say something wrong about his wishes .
but we have no reason to believe that .
you can ' t be sure when you can talk .
now it ' s your turn .
i may not have a legal reason .
but i have a moral compass .
that ' s the point .
then why stop there ?
he can clone his mother too .
his grandfather .
one day they can play with their grandmother ' s twins in the sand pool .
the famous can start selling their dna .
imagine being parents to barry white ' s brother .
once the technology ' s position has begun to take over my universe , the line will be over ?
once we were afraid of heart transplants .
the idea of a baby was judgmental .
now the truth and society accepts the truth .
there are steps to clone organs , save lives , destroy disease .
these can be real .
but to clone a human clone ' s dna and make it look like medical ?
you may fall apart .
i ' m sorry .
i appreciate it .
i don ' t want a rematch .
hi .
hi .
you come here often ?
that ' s my entrance sentence .
terrible entrance sentence .
has it worked before ?
better .
you wanna go in the bar ?
not tonight .
because you beat larry ?
it ' s not that .
honestly , i didn ' t want to win this time .
no , i want to be alone tonight .
alone with her .
not at all .
like you said , most people don ' t dance with a dream disco .
you ' re not crazy .
honestly , i ' m a little jealous .
when you ' re disappointed in the real world , you create things .
hey .
maybe the three of us can walk .
give me a chance .
if he doesn ' t come , i still have .
well , i ' ll do that .
let ' s go .
who knew the karaoke night would be the most delightful party at the front door ?
you told p . diddy and kissinger ?
i say , "islands in the rockam" never said so .
limo driver called and said . . .
disgrace the wedding of mandimilioner donald trump ?
sam , i ' ve been in vegas for 00 minutes , and i haven ' t even played a hand blackjack .
your favorite table is ready .
ladies love a good karaoke song , danny .
call me .
you think you can get every girl you want ?
take him .
alone , my friend .
here ' s for the new virgin nature conference .
girls without technically a virgin can change pure .
the cards are hit these two hotel hotels this month , and the last overtime report says they ' re missing from blakacks .
there ' s a card number down there .
ed thinks there might be a card number .
maybe we can keep this conversation later , like drinking .
patty , it ' s been three and you ' ve been here a week .
i didn ' t pay my rent , and i let the owner stay . . .
listen , i ' m sorry , but this is a business .
if we pay for every shirt you sink , i ' ll sink .
all right , the gift boxes are packed and the guests are waiting to go to their rooms .
our flowers brought the orchids and the rest of them are coming tomorrow .
however , if he doesn ' t show up for some reason , a ship . . . for my next tulal . . . for my next tulips from am going from am
mary , don ' t worry .
i ' m sure everything will be fine .
you ' re the most comfortable thing i ' ve ever seen .
thanks for coming , galina .
this one looks like a hundred thousand dresses .
a hundred thousand dollars ?
like i said , it ' s my first time .
it ' s a lot more than what we lost .
you don ' t play with a certain duck .
numbers sit on a table , and if there ' s rich people , they play , right ?
the suspect , the redhead , yellow dress , heading west .
thank you .
mr . sperreos , i ' m coming from security .
it ' s always the question .
we haven ' t got married yet and you ' ve been out all night .
it ' s no good .
honey , i ' m winning here .
this night is over and yours is too .
all right .
i said to callald trump , that our wedding ' s supposed to be a delicious chicken bloody chicken at the palm beach party .
my team ' s been trying to make your wedding go by the biggest and most elegant wedding in the city .
come on .
even as a secretary , he was always like a boss .
why are you so helpless romantic ?
when your commission stopped playing , montecito might still be in the front and that ' s all i care about .
let ' s go , people .
the poor man told us that the air conditioning was a dozen different things .
he can point the 00 killers and make the game rich .
he ' s sitting there in the slot machine all night , playing rare .
and he can ' t take his eyes off the blake mask .
speros likes to get up and win a game a minute before he gets into a game .
you can ' t prove it .
even if i count cards , it ' s not illegal .
that ' s technically true .
but we have a different justice in vegas .
like before , i can catch a cheat and destroy it in the desert .
i ' ll be honest with you , i ' m old-fashioned .
please .
now that we have your picture , you ' re in the black book .
if you take a step inside montecito , i ' ll have you arrested in private .
did you hear ?
hey , jack !
he let us down 000 ,000 .
you know , as long as you don ' t have a machine in your hand , you know as much as i do , and he didn ' t have it
we could at least have some fun with him .
it ' s not your story .
if someone ' s financial and teach them things , nothing ends .
i ' m mike from mystigque last night .
the guy from phoenix .
there are other towns you don ' t actually exist .
desines , for example .
surprising , but i have to go .
i ' m devastating , am i not ?
you finally said something i joined .
i think you should be the problem because i ' m usually attractive .
then what ?
maybe i ' m a little nervous around you because you ' re so beautiful .
i ' m being wished .
you know what we ' re gonna do ?
what ?
we ' re gonna sit down and try to understand why he ' s not here drinking .
patty .
almost there .
did they say i ' m okay ?
it doesn ' t matter if you ' re okay .
i should fire you .
please .
thanks , thanks , thanks .
the tailor said he sent back this morning , but there ' s no record of him being there .
000 friends tomorrow at this wedding , the president of the state , industry leader , oprah .
do you want to tell oprah that his wedding was canceled and came to las vegas for nothing ?
if we don ' t , montecito will be pleased to get the same .
that dress was a fashion witness .
a dozen french tailor sewing orders .
there ' s nothing like him .
you know how much that dress cost me ?
this is a big problem , sam ?
wait .
hey , danny , you asked me to look at the big black jackacks .
montecito ' s already wasted millions of dollars for food , flowers and fun .
 . . .if the wedding isn ' t as planned , and lipworth refuses to give it to him .
you think someone actually stole it ?
what ' s the value on the street ?
why not the tailor galzina ?
he was interested when he heard the price of the dress .
mike .
hey .
let me know how it goes .
did they use the same techs the sperreos and the team used ?
we catch a team , they send somebody else in a couple of hours .
if we don ' t get behind this back of this , we might have to give them the key to the safe .
better hurry up now , you bastard .
are you talking to speros ?
you better get your hands off  ' cause the president ' s attack me would cause more than i won blackjack than montecito .
that was good .
did i take the dress ?
i just want to know what happened .
i make changes , and i ' ll let montecito know about the dress .
is there a camera in the store ?
i saw real diamonds in a costume for elton john .
if you compare it to this dress , nothing .
galina protects herself .
you ' re free to go .
i ' m helping , patty .
god knows why i agreed to this project ?
i ' ve always helped the baby bird , even if it ' s mad .
then i ' ll get my tray .
this is christina , one of our best waitresses .
knees bend , waist back .
most important of all , trust .
trust .
it ' s full of martinis with the weight of the trays .
it ' s gonna be the hardest to move .
he ' s not even looking at the glasses .
he believes his talent to do right and here he is .
zen team .
you ' re not so black .
breathe with me , patty .
be like booze , patty .
you want me to sit here until mystigque opens up ?
thank god i don ' t want you standing here like karate kids .
you too .
this morning , vic sent one of his guys to the store to buy a dress .
yeah .
do you remember who you sent ?
the tailor gave me a record , but i couldn ' t remember the face .
bart , you went to the store this morning to buy a dress .
no , i didn ' t .
why ?
joey stopped me when i was coming out and he wanted to go himself .
scan joey ' s face and get his address for me .
thanks .
i ' m sorry .
the sea air .
why would you make him break his chips ?
did you hear from the dress ?
yes , candy .
who ' s candy ?
no , because i know you ' re not here , but the others call .
do you know where we can find it ?
danny mccoy , montecito watching and security .
how do you know nick sperreos ?
cops don ' t scare my eyes .
okay , wait , wait .
fine , fine .
that ' s enough .
okay , i know him .
he came here several times with his friends .
these friends ?
you know these ?
yeah , i guess so .
nick ' s a good boy .
someone also asked me to break the chips .
i guess he thought i wouldn ' t doubt it .
the strippers are always rewarded with the flash .
look , it was good for five minutes work and i didn ' t have to take my clothes off .
why are you so interested ?
because sperreos and his friends are involved in some sort of carding operation .
i thought they were just some rich kids .
there ' s someone behind this and i need to find who .
do you have any idea who ' s trained them and finances ?
once they came with one of them big ones .
yeah , they called him bucky .
mitch , did you scan joey ' s face ?
go ahead .
someone ' s paying him .
can you make it official ?
no , but i can get another angle .
so , lpworth ' s fiancée , lissy ?
we need to talk .
but you already know , right ?
i know you paid to get out of the dressing suit .
what i don ' t understand , why ?
this wedding , details , dignity , cost . . .
listen .
if you want to leave , it ' s kind of weird .
that ' s the point .
i don ' t know if i want to leave .
i love him but his life . . .
i mean , how many of the 000 people who came in , my friend ?
people say it ' s a cinderella story .
i ' m not cinderella .
i ' m just a new jersey girl .
i don ' t know much , but when i thought my wedding was 00 times expensive than my parents '  house . . .
that ' s not true .
yeah .
jared and i are so different .
i mean , what ' s the damage ?
how old do you think these kids are ?
00 , nothing big .
danny , the years you wanted .
we ' ll see .
they ' re all 00 years old and they all have math skills to count cards .
then they must have been trained and trained children .
then i remember , how can i bring them to the knee ?
considering how the second team got here right away , i started at local college .
because you ' re great and i ' m interested in the less attractive ones .
perhaps change time .
listen , mike , there ' s something i need to tell you before we move forward .
i came to vegas for "sitting virginity ."
rest .
i made mistakes with the men in my past , and i wanted to open a clean page , and i swore to the house until i was married .
i mean , it wouldn ' t make her less valuable than my gift before .
it ' s nice to marry .
good .
what ' s up ?
do you want to go back to school ?
i ' d like to go back and do an alloplch degrees and go to the rain woods and examine indian people .
you ' re an idiot .
what ' s up , ruben ?
touch me , i ' ll call my lawyer right away .
you gonna call your lawyer ?
what do you want ?
where ' s bucky ?
i don ' t know what you ' re talking about .
we have records of robbing montecito .
i don ' t think students like this kind of thing here .
i can call the dean right now and radio your ass out of here .
please , don ' t tell my family .
hey .
hey .
did you hear about being a virgin again ?
so you knew about this all the time ?
i ' m sorry , but i could get every girl i wanted , and she just became unbearable .
yeah , i set up a trap so sweet and beautiful .
you were gonna stop sleeping with you .
hey , where are you going ?
hi , mike .
i won ' t need you .
hey .
i pretended to be an idiot .
i needed some time to get through this whole process .
do you think there ' s any place in your heart that can give me a second chance ?
the room service , baby ?
excuse me .
why all the precious presents ?
because i think it ' s ridiculous for the gift paperwork that ' s been tearing down after christmas .
look , five or six times i was born again .
and why isn ' t that me ?
i tried to change .
so this is my fault ?
i ' m really sorry .
i heard your advice .
i spoke to jared and told him everything .
the wedding ' s off .
i said cancel wedding , not marriage .
does bucky train his team here ?
hey , ruben , if something funny , you get your family on the phone .
bucky .
mr . buckner ?
you know him ?
my math teacher in high school .
i ' m a security manager in montecito .
yeah .
remember miss buckner ?
last year , coach ran away with kajoyan .
nafaka ' s killing me .
they owe me for school night .
but don ' t miss taxes .
you guys made a lot of money from a lot of casino .
i ' m guessing some of that money wasn ' t reported to the tax office .
keep these card numbers off montecito , and we ' ll forget about what happened .
before these kids leave , danny will take pictures and information .
what ' s the name of your left meal ?
oh , my god .
did you miss the flowers , the air and oprah ?
you know i don ' t care about those things .
all that matters is spending the rest of my skate with you .
delinda , i ' m sorry .
he needs to listen to you , honey .
i ' ll make you a star .
i hope you made a note somewhere .
careful , we ' re about to enter .
do i know you ?
vinny ' s hanging out with your mother .
do you really want to risk your life for a skirt and a dumpster ?
any sign of the professor ?
i know why . . .
stein will kill sara at the library .
he ' s got a speedster in steadystein ' s sword , and he ' s pushing under his ship .
since when do you call him jax ?
unfortunately , it won ' t take long .
what did you do tostein ?
capone ' s men are taking over the ship .
you ' re here because i killed jsa ' s stupid leader .
it was mr . rex tyler , wasn ' t it ?
i don ' t want to spend the whole night here .
nothing , you drunks .
my job is better .
i ' m the authorities in the all ,
every night , 00 ,000 people come here for fun , and i ' m pretty sure they have fun .
are you an actress ?
yeah .
okay .
tell hastingsen i ' m the boss here .
don ' t say that .
anything she wants , just say it .
have you seen a hot bargain manager around here ?
where were you , buddy ?
i have a meeting after the game .
how much time do we have ?
0 minutes , 00 seconds .
0 minutes , i can do a lot in 00 seconds .
you ' re a funny girl .
i ' m seeing other people .
i ' m seeing other people .
happy birthday , ben .
how do you know ?
morning .
all right .
happy birthday , ben .
you ' re a care guy , aren ' t you ?
two years ago , you said , "yes ."
a little tricky because you don ' t always ask yes-no questions .
for now , forget what i said .
there ' s gonna be circus here tonight , and if there ' s ice on the floor , those fire-fighter guys could fall on their own fires .
understand ?
you told me not to run in the hallway .
forget about our conversation two years ago .
no , no , no .
he wants to talk .
that ' s not good , dude .
melt that ice , bobby .
benjamin !
come here .
hurry .
crystal , before you got upset and started chasing everyone , about this ice . . .
did you see a little white pill that says something in spanish ?
i don ' t understand your level of interest .
or did i already take that pill ?
hello .
yeah , i think you already got the pill .
i hate the circus coming here .
happy ?
they ' re sorry ?
why are their pockets so big ?
i ' m sure you ' re talking about clowns .
good morning , beautiful people .
good morning , alono .
you ' re in an amazing mood again .
every day is a good day , man .
seriously , every day ?
i was the most beautiful day .
that day i stopped looking after myself and started to turn myself into the great people of san diego .
what are you doing ?
i gotta get that pill out of my body .
what ' s the help meeting today ?
i put big money in the dog contests that wasn ' t legal himalaya .
one of the dogs claim himalayi bit someone .
anyway , i have the himalaya nightmare .
can ' t we use that money to make this place better ?
all right , you own this place , we ' ll do what you say .
have you seen the oil painting ?
don ' t forget to bring some kind of kids for the photo .
you know , black , white .
bring in the original boy .
we ' re gonna need a cup .
the indian boy will give me a cup .
you ' re right clapping , because these are very good ideas .
benjamin , i almost forgot .
your . . . your son ?
how ' d you get your new assistant ?
thank you for that .
he set a man on fire ?
there was an investigation .
the evidence was inadequate .
i mean , yeah .
he ' s good , right ?
she set him on fire .
not very well .
a-a-al-al-al . . .
alono . . .
what do you think it would mean for a girl to send a message , "we need to talk" ?
i ' m in similar things too .
i think you ' ll get a better chance of getting closer .
what could be better than that ?
yeah , that ' s what i thought .
happy birthday , little man .
morning , heather .
morning .
i ' ll tell you why i fainted .
ben !
there ' s a man in his office , and he ' s very attractive .
okay .
hi .
hi .
is there someone else here more attractive than you ?
no .
okay .
me .
i ' m roman .
so you ' re crystal ' s son .
this must be terrible for you .
yeah .
it sure isn ' t great .
i wonder how they swimming in the water .
okay .
i like mafia movies .
also talent as talent . . .
this place is exciting .
political meetings here , sports , rodeo , night football , motorcycles .
you ' re not interested in any of this ?
remember me ?
i texted you three messages , and you didn ' t answer any of them .
i guess after five months of sleeping together , you ' d have to find out that i ' m crazy .
look , i know we hate commitment .
that ' s what i agree with "date relationship ."
but this morning , i woke up alone in your house , which means you were sneaking out of the house .
when i was paying for the coffee , i couldn ' t find my underwear until i got out of my wallet .
i got another coffee with this , more . . .
who is this ?
i like a mafia movies .
and you , i really need to talk .
yes , it is , because it ' s a better chance of getting closer .
what could be better than that ?
this is a good job opportunity for you .
see you at the christmas party .
i don ' t think you mean that .
speak spanish .
i know a little spanish .
yeah , i never understood what you said .
actually , your english is pretty good .
fleet !
crystal .
did you hear what i just said ?
i didn ' t .
let me see that talk .
i think you shouldn ' t say "your tears , black kids !"
well , when should i say ?
you never should .
and i wouldn ' t sing the song either .
still ice .
yeah , i know .
that doesn ' t sound sad to me .
this is your way of life .
you ' ve never asked for someone who ' s emotionally emotionally , and wondering how and where she is , when she comes to work in the morning , kissing you at home .
what good is celebrating these on your birthday ?
but you throw big parties on your own birthdays .
i need to know i ' ll never be alone .
i ' m not so sure what to do now .
i ' ll go , you step on the gas , go .
thanks .
black , white , white , and . . . and . . . and . . . and-- and--
don ' t sing that song .
i think we should go to dinner to celebrate my birthday .
that would be a good vaccine for our relationship .
i think we should be together .
i ' m gonna end this relationship .
why did you let me speak first ?
you tell me first .
the first time we all talk about this is you .
remember we said we were seeing other people ?
alono ?
he ' s my best friend .
she ' s wanted to live with me for a while .
he wants to commit .
he wants to get hooked ?
the man we ' re talking about , right ?
what a man .
look , i . . .
alono is an adult .
he cares about other people too .
he ask questions about me , and he listens to my answers too .
what bothers me is that i thought we were the same .
when you said you were emotional in emotional damage , . . .
how did he react when you told him ?
he was already a very happy man .
it ' s blowing him up .
live with me .
we can do the commitment thing .
honey , i ' m not the right woman for you .
you ' re so sweet , you ' re great to have fun .
but no one can be right for you , because you only think of yourself .
what was that ?
i think the sound came through my head .
i can ' t be fries .
i guess .
you know what the worst thing is ?
i ' m not thinking of anyone but myself .
it ' s really impossible for me to take care of other people .
suddenly , i feel the need to make contact , but i have no idea how to do it .
i ' m in trouble , man .
it ' s from the victim , isn ' t it ?
yeah .
so what ?
i think it ' s great .
come on , man .
sunlight .
hi , ben .
hi .
very attractive man .
sorry .
anybody know how to use a whale ?
come , clowns .
we ' re almost done .
keep breaking .
good day .
where ' s the original kid ?
i wanted a particular boy .
there ' s an indian boy over there .
ono .
yeah .
yeah .
thank you .
they ' ve stopped .
most people ask why i love children so much .
maybe because i never had my own child .
i believe that our children ' s happiness is what we want to live happily with the people who live in this society .
they ' re our future , and they ' re our most important gay .
when you ask them to do something for you , they enjoy it .
or the older we got older , i just started to believe that a life you only lived for yourself is a bomb .
actually , i wasn ' t gonna , but i ' m gonna have to share a little song i ' ve written in this special situation with you .
it was really touching your speech if we put some of the musical part aside .
sometimes it ' s really fun to work with you .
i ' m amazing right now .
on three , everyone say , "thank you , crystal cohen ."
two . . . two . . .
oh , my god !
clown clowns !
clown clowns !
clown clowns !
clown clowns !
clown clowns !
what a wonderful moment .
i noticed you left a little early .
hi again .
are you really okay ?
i ' m a little scared .
sure .
it ' s perfectly normal to think you chose the right guy .
i ' m 000% sure i chose the right man .
all right .
what a wonderful moment .
i ' ve never done this before .
what if i ' m not ready ?
what if he just thinks that he wants me ?
after you have me , what if he doesn ' t want me anymore ?
of course he ' ll want you .
you have everything .
everything .
okay ?
okay .
okay .
actually , we can have sex one last time .
hey , crystal .
i want to have sex with him .
i ' ll see what i can do .
can you give your attention to the poor boy you threw into the air ?
luckily , i convinced them to run this photo .
more than a cop kick .
less than the mayor ' s ship sinking .
great .
cool .
when i was ready to catch you , . . .
i want you to sit down with the joy of the child ' s joy and loyalty and a man who ' s gonna be here at the sunlight center of the sunlight , and talk to someone who ' s gonna be
get in the car .
get in the car .
i ' m sure you have a lot to talk about .
great .
nice years , ben .
thanks .
look .
what ' s your name ?
dan .
thanks , dan .
i forgot .
have you seen alice ?
in his office .
it was business .
i . . .
i know what you mean .
what do you do in a situation like this ?
i think i ' m gonna run like my life depends on this .
yeah , that ' s what i ' m gonna do .
they ' ve set up security cameras directly to paddy .
it melts in your mouth .
he rebels everything you say .
this is bullshit friend .
these guys finally realized by living with me , they finally realized how cool and funny it is .
dee , you ' re a secret mission , okay ?
dee , we ' re putting you in charge of charlie ' s mission , but the arrogance and questions we take ?
maybe we can go to the private office upstairs .
do i have to know the guy that spaghetti over your face ?
and i ' m gonna buy the guy i don ' t know who ' s behind me .
i said why .
because i think you ' ve been hanging out pretty long last time .
i ' m sittin '  because charlie fucking stopped eating lunch .
i don ' t want to come across something that you ' ve come across .
like i told that thing a few minutes ago , our fish ran out today .
instead , let ' s all get a plate of hot pipe spaghetti .
extra sauce on it .
i ' ve always wanted to see this .
even the folks , baseball players , even protocols .
god save the cream pie and america .
look , i ' m an experimenter with a long history with a long , long history from the countries .
imagine my recipe for a hate pie recipe , your low-tech worker power .
i had a few days in the factory because of the accidents i was in the top .
in fact , we ' re pretty cool with the chinese factory .
i don ' t think we need to worry about the good situation .
just old porns .
everyone to the tucker train .
it ' s not exactly the way it looks .
no , no .
these are the things my children care about when they were little .
besides , you know when you can ' t sell this disgusting stuff in the garage .
these boxes show how our life is perfect .
like they always fake you ?
pictures and thanksgiving turkey hand ?
i ' m sorry , honey .
i put the finger here , because i have a feeling something ' s changed here .
it ' s not danny who ' s just wearing a jersey uniform and hit a bat .
they were near the christmas lights in the basement , and i realized mrs . bart lost his nail .
i just didn ' t see you had a plan to win .
yeah , you gave us a free beer , and then you said , "give me to vote for me ."
we ' re very lucky to have everyone back .
i really don ' t do anything about sports anymore .
god , it feels like it ' s from another life .
i need to hit something with a bat for beer .
okay , brawler ' s , i ' d like to propose a toast before the game .
maybe we ' ll remember everything you don ' t win , but we have a keg !
wait .
everyone , this riley and my daughter emma .
i mean , wheeler ' s on 0-0 with unt planned pregnancy 0-0 .
tuck , why don ' t you give something to the new ones ?
ben !
that ' s something i know .
you ' re going out with mom ?
i was gonna talk to myself , but bonnie said she ' d handle this .
i got it , but i didn ' t tell him .
you can ' t say you ' re doing well .
i mean , when your mom and coach are on a date , they can have a pillow talk .
if i didn ' t call the girl you were happy hours hours ago , we ' d be happy to have your voice cut out .
we could have more babies .
i ' m going to practice until my brain is over .
he ' s defending his dinner around , i think he ' s doing it well .
her father ' s daughter .
my mother will come soon , will you take the equipment downstairs to the field for me ?
it ' s a lot more than the heavy one i had before .
you don ' t care about the shelves , do you ?
sounds like i missed the game .
you missed one little thing .
the kids stole riley ' s captain .
i was saying that you lost it .
i was feeding my baby and you took my team away .
i was wearing your glove . . . and then everyone started yelling .
"you ' re amazing !"
because i heard it was unbelievable .
maybe if you come to my place , you ' ll do good things i haven ' t done in a long time .
because i don ' t care what the others say .
"your faces , hangers ." i ' m so excited !
we only had some italian food .
that ' s why i ' m trying to stop you .
honey , i don ' t think we should talk about these parts , these are about my personal life .
okay , honey , i know you don ' t want to hear this , but i ' m a woman and i need them .
i won ' t even open my mouth .
he said , "it ' s obsessive ."
i don ' t want someone to cancel their plans .
thank you , danny .
not yet , but she will be .
honey , are you okay ?
i tried to come early as i could .
with my hair and this , you ' re 00 minutes away .
i couldn ' t call anyone who could look at emma .
the dentist said i should see you right away .
and remember , don ' t bring home a giant toothbrush .
the bathroom key .
i ' m sorry about your date with hank .
i shouldn ' t even talk to you right now .
please tell me emma ' s in the car outside the park .
i don ' t know what hank canceled or something .
but if my mother asks , they hid me here .
you care about other people ' s happiness .
hope he doesn ' t see and doesn ' t understand .
dude , i need you back .
you think he stopped being rigantor ?
does it make small planets sparkle in my head ?
will you look here ?
the minister has gone home .
if hank doesn ' t work , it ' s like someone else .
do you have a menu down here ?
mom , i ' m home .
what are you doing here ?
i ' m sure that ' s my robe .
hank , are you ready for round two ?
danny , there ' s nothing here .
you ' re unbelievable .
yeah , she hates it .
because we ' re not watching the same game here .
it ' s actually full of vodka .
we ' re gonna drink this and throw it away .
we have a chance to make a clean shot .
sit down with the other ladies .
what about riley ?
okay , tuck , your turn .
hit me again and don ' t go out of the field .
when i told riley something he shouldn ' t have heard before , he ate my cake boy .
i still can ' t forget you ' re still eating your brown .
don ' t worry , i ' ll watch your back , okay ?
hey , teammates .
don ' t you think she looks sweet today ?
is that my phone ?
something about play .
thank god .
i was worried i couldn ' t bring you back .
i know what you ' re thinking , but you gotta do something other than control the team .
like what i did now ?
i want you to be more serious in the games .
i ' m having a harder time putting you on the team .
honestly , i have to get you off the team .
but i can ' t .
i ' ll really miss you when you don ' t move .
thank you .
what did you want to tell me ?
just . . .
"kik , riley ' s gone .
"i ' m chasing him right now ."
what ?
that ' s a bad version of what i told you .
coach , can we talk ?
i think you want your robe back .
it didn ' t . . .
mom told me what happened .
i ' m really sorry about that hill .
i ' ll tell the next one i ' ll be better .
i don ' t think it ' ll be next .
don ' t blame him for being a punk .
so you ' re keeping a funny woman out of your league ?
no , that ' s my mother you ' re talking about .
and someone who goes out with him is very lucky .
i ' ll go out with him .
you take him down , it ' s safe .
what ' s wrong with me ?
maybe you ' re just so smart and so beautiful .
winning is fun for you .
oh , my god , i like this !
but what does that buy me ?
that room is full of cups and that ' s no one to share it with me ?
danny figured it out .
yeah , none of us will ever be like your brother .
yeah , i guess i heard that once or twice .
right .
right .
i was thinking about a change in progress .
i ' ve never tried it before .
yeah , i think you need to figure out how to get brawler out without me .
ben , nobody wants me .
go brawler !
all thanks , my dear captain .
without riley ref .
he really would need a new glass .
no , i can ' t hide anymore .
honey , you have to help me .
the fear in their eyes caused them to close .
get lost .
don ' t worry .
i ' ll find a man who can make you happy .
okay .
it seems to be getting better .
i understand when i see my son at work .
as i always said , thank god you gave me ben .
do wheeler , do wheeler . . .
what ' s riley doing ?
they call him wheeler .
we ' ll use you to watch the inside .
why is patty interested in this murder ?
i suggest mr . purcell not answer any other questions .
you were alone in your home with your wife ' s body .
there ' s no sign of forced access to the house .
patty , i saw the guy who did this .
our company was being held in toxological research on a chemical compound .
these units are worth hundreds of billion dollars .
michael , this is daniel purcell .
we have a protection problem .
chief consultant of the world ' s third great energy expert .
did you tell anyone about us ?
the acid rains that are coming from the charcoal-loos , they ' re putting bullets into the country ' s average 00 times .
the neighborhoods tried to sue a mass case .
so there were over 000 cases in their rights over the last three years ?
why didn ' t she bribe you ?
i wonder the same thing , but i don ' t know how patty could have known we set up tom .
what did you find out about purcell ?
we have to make sure that our secret is still out there so we can move forward .
no problem with me .
ellen , i know you ' re disappointing , but you need to back off .
we ' re all gonna get back .
it could help me .
i have no experience in law .
we must have chased him before we could find something to steal .
it was dark the first time .
you know , the other night , i was wondering if someone messed up the houses .
isn ' t it your job to find this , detective ?
let ' s see if there ' s anything in the pictures that might bring your memory to it .
mr . purcell didn ' t come here to be harassed .
he always did .
this is a very important progress , mr . purcell .
if you find the ring , you ' ll find my wife ' s killer .
mr . purcell , i believe you .
because the person who killed christine is still out there somewhere and you certainly have no use for that .
you can ' t use them against me .
don ' t answer that .
i swear you ' re pretending to be arrested .
one thing three years ago isn ' t possible .
no , but it ' s like he ' s lying about everything .
i mean , he ' s been going home twice and nothing ' s stolen .
wasn ' t the tenant ' s health damage ?
we spoke on the phone a few times , but i guess he still won ' t take it .
he wants to introduce me to the man he was with .
if there ' s anything we need to know , patty ' s gonna tell us when he ' s ready .
whatever you got the company into , it ' s better if there ' s nothing but stolen documents .
if you ' re wondering what happened to christine purcella , look at the sad widow .
my only job is to protect mr . kendrick and if you did something to expose him or you or that you or that you did something to expose nationalour . . .
everything ok in new york ?
daniel purcell , i ' m meeting patty hewes .
do you have any reason to believe the finger of the death of your wife ' s death is in the finger of the utima national day ?
i ' ve been watching a lot of farm animals die these days .
00 years ago , he used daniel purcell as an expert witness , and he won a case .
then why did the demon global global ' s report have to be acceptable to 000 ?
daniel purcell was a brilliant man , but when he came face to face with patty .
no , it ' s just another big conspiracy to expose for you .
as soon as i tell you what i know about the nation national , you throw me aside .
whatever he tells you , you can ' t trust him .
i don ' t know who killed your wife , but you ' ll be accused of it .
and they worked together before that purcell demon global .
nine months later , michael was born from purcell ' s statement .
only two .
we ' re gonna meet the unexpected .
we ' ll disable them with a major attack .
on three .
one , two , three .
shoot them !
detective stark ?
excuse me .
yeah .
that guy over there .
and you pulled him over on the 00th road ?
am i sworn ?
i ' d appreciate it if you ' d stop asking me that .
was mr young ?
i can ' t tell if you won ' t again .
what ?
do you know what this is , you son of a bitch ?
it wasn ' t a real bomb .
" no blood , no crime ." no crime ."
not legally , detective .
even threatening a bomb and a clear physical threat .
i ' m terrible .
i think what ' s terrible is your shirt .
your honor , we demand the reddine of the case .
liz , i don ' t know what to say .
he ' s your partner , jack .
that ' s not enough reason , jack .
we ' ve been trying to catch wayne young for years .
liz , i . . .
jack , what are you gonna say ?
i need to be alone .
you want a chips ?
no , i don ' t want chips , dan .
i think they put spices in it .
feels better .
you ruined the case , dan . . .
but state case .
you mean your ex ' s case ?
they ' re shutting down the investigation .
that means the department doesn ' t exist anymore .
department ?
and fight crime with sticks ?
you need a financial source for research .
tell you what .
good luck to you .
you ' ll see .
good day to you all .
see you in hell .
here .
i thought you might remember that .
you ' re absolutely right .
hey , you got any nikotin gum ?
i can ' t think of myself without them .
because i left those cancer sticks .
that ' s it .
all right , we need to do a couple of feet .
first , i gotta get myself a pumpkin .
you got it wrong !
there ' s something wrong !
please !
i made a deal while you were in prison .
the same for both of us .
what kind of deal ?
heroin .
near south america .
i put it in one of our trucks .
i have a client .
and this is just the beginning .
if it works , we ' ll get more heroin .
wayne , we ' re both so close !
you meet the man , and we ' ll deliver .
and the cops ?
they can ' t come after you cross the border !
cops can ' t do anything !
rough day ?
yeah .
girl or job ?
you ' re gonna need a second doughnut .
hey , dan .
what ' s up ?
of course .
i ' m gonna open this up to liz in the morning .
i ' ll call you back .
don ' t move !
okay .
okay .
don ' t move !
i ' m not moving !
why are you attack me ?
you ' re hurting the holy connection .
i got three arrest orders on me .
it ' s not the first thing to do with cops .
that ' s what i want to talk to you about .
how would you feel if the arrest warrants were lifted ?
when you say "don ' t miss . . ."
"julius , you don ' t have to go to prison , do you ? "
because that ' s how it came to me .
i ' m all yours , man .
you can do as you please .
i want information about wayne young .
i know that .
i know wayne young .
how do you feel ?
all i want is a piece of paper , pen , and . . . and writing . . .
do it .
there ' s a place fromwood , okay ?
that ' s it .
does that make us better ?
we ' ll put him in jail . . .
we ' re fine .
okay .
because i want to embrace you .
you can hug .
all right .
thank you very much , man .
okay .
okay .
what can i do for you , jack ?
i was talking to dan . . .
which means everything is in the book . . .
not your partner ' s style .
actually , that ' s why i can send her home .
don ' t worry about it .
just give me some information to get me against wayne .
okay .
i ' ll see you at the office at 0:00 .
wayne was working in a garage in a garage in the east dallas .
he worked for a company like shelell .
but what are we going to arrest him for ?
we ' ll think of something when we get there .
no , dan .
we ' ll do an research .
yeah , that ' ll work .
by the way . . .
how did you know where wayne was doing business ?
am i still sworn ?
here ' s the address .
hello !
weird .
what did you say we go in and take care of the van ?
and this ?
we ' re gonna bail back without permission ?
they should know that security is terrible .
besides , nobody gets in here without a helmet .
you mean us ?
hey , ours is a violation .
it ' s only after over $0 .00 .
so i ' m fine with that .
she ' s like a law . . .
it ' ll make you angry , but it won ' t do anything to calm you down .
things get worse .
what is this place ?
what are they doing here ?
we don ' t know . . .
i have to call liz .
just . . .
dan , what are you doing ?
dan , we can ' t be here .
that ' s illegal , dan ?
okay ?
this van is full of boxes .
yeah .
full boxes .
come on .
we ' re over a 00-foot thing .
i can feel the leaks in my trouble !
another excuse for the report .
listen , dan .
we had a bad start here , okay ?
did you hear something ?

i ' ll turn it off .
dan , this is an illegal investigation , okay ?
if we get caught , we ' re in big trouble !
your phone ' s ringing .

it was just a little misunder ?
yeah .
let ' s make some money .
yeah , me too .
damn !
what is that ?
thanks for coming .
i ' m dying slow .
you look good .
i ' m not okay .
you know my parole .
the police deal was trapped in one of wayne young ' s trucks .
there ' s no truck in there !
i mean , i have a girlfriend in jamaika .
maybe we ' ll get back here and open a motel .
but why am i here ?
you ' ll introduce me to wayne young .
you two are friends , she . . .
that ' s a deep meaningful word .
we ' re more colleagues , man .
sometimes she asked me to take her to the north , that ' s all .
skeeter , honey . . .
you gotta find this truck , and you gotta find it now , man .
look , i ' ll give you $000 .
this man , man , man !

well , i ' ll help you find the truck .
i didn ' t mean to yell at you .
there ' s the real one .
they ' re not going to examine the entire crow .
what was that ?
panic .
dan , this is texas , okay ?
you ' ve just got a 00-mile field recipe .
god damn !
then we break the door so we can jump out .
what ' s wrong ?
physical , dan .
it ' s suicide .
not if you throw it fast enough , man .
we ' re gonna take the speed of the van down to zero .
come on .
why are you acting like something bad ?
we found wayne young right where we wanted it .
yeah .
two stripes in a countryside on the road .
exactly .
i ' m detective jack bailey .
please leave a message and i ' ll call you back again
well , it ' s been 00 minutes .
congratulations .
you ' re going the same way your partner .
still waiting for your girl ?
detective bailey ' s not my girlfriend .
jack .
wherever you are , i hope you ' re enjoying yourself .
all i know is they ' re somewhere south .
how are you ?
thanks very much .
man , what took you so long ?
dude , you asked me to find a criminal , didn ' t you ?
can we just focus , please ?
where ' s the truck with the police in there ?
this way .
so i just go this way ?
what ' s gonna happen on that road ?
i ' m working on the ropes .
dude , you . . .
i think he had a deal with a guy .
dude , you ' re gonna kill me .
you ' ll definitely kill me .
you know anything else ?
i heard it ' s a scary look .
besides , it ' s not from this country .
we can make the deal thursday .
i ' m not british .
i ' m south africa .
yeah , there ' s zurich in south africa .
see you thursday .
that ' s it .
coming with you was not part of our deal .
hey .
do you want my car or not ?
yes , i do .
that ' s what i thought .
thank you .
good night .
interesting friends , man .
the guy was wearing some weird boots , man .
i have those boots !
yeah .
what else was i supposed to do ?
we ' re friends , right ?
you would have done the same for me .
any other deals ?
anything i should know ?
that ' s it .
dan , what are you doing ?
good luck .
i ' ll take care of it .
what are you doing ?
don ' t i look like someone who ' s trying not to get crazy about me ?
apparently .
i haven ' t opened them all yet .
are you looking for the smells especially ?
i ' ll ask you something , dan .
like i said , these boxes are full of crime .
yes . . .
are you planning to help ?
this situation needs a little more light .
mysterious day .
natural .
i like that .
don ' t tell me i ' m gonna make it before we get there , dan
don ' t tell me i ' m gonna make it before we get there , dan
don ' t tell me i ' m gonna make it before we get there , dan
dude , will you shut up ?
i ' m trying to get on the phone !
yeah .
sort of .
lubbock ' s in lubock , "lill right now the antique shop ."
i don ' t know , man .
a place like a souvenir shop .
and . . .
god .
i ' ve learned some information about the south american man .
perfect .
just focus on where the deal ' s made .
save the mustache .
save the mustache .
the smell of candles started choking me .
they smell like mystery nature .
i think i ' m gonna throw up .
if you throw up , i ' ll light more candles .
no .
give me that .
at least 0 pounds .
heroin .
heroin .
up high .
little pieces .
it ' s probably in indian .
wow , you know a lot about heroin .
thank you .
you mean you planned this ?
being a cop is a team business .
and you , me , jack .
that way we ' d end it together .
really ?
"take it , sal , catch it again ."
the bad cops are just chasing criminals with guns on their own hands .
good cops are chasing criminals with guns in their team .
thanks for the career advice .
hey , listen , dan . . .
what ?
the van ' s stopping .
why are we here so early ?
what kind of problem did you have ?
this little town is in full states .
i mean , the closest police are 000 miles away .
we ' re not getting caught .

anyway , he ran here . . .
there ' s no trace of p ' o .
what about heroin ?
no sign of him either .
apparently he took her and ran away .
he has no witnesses .
and wayne young will testify against him .
and i ' m sure he ' ll say exactly like . . .
"i ' m gonna drag the couch into hell with me ."
well , that ' ll do .
yeah , but you know what ' s not gonna work ?
i wasn ' t involved in something like that .
it just happened .
you came all this way because you ' re worried about me ?
no .
i came all this way to see wayne young get arrested .
i ' m so sorry , jack .
well , i stole a sports car and i set the truck on fire .
did you even think about that ?
we ' re questioning the south africa man .
did you know the zaffes lived there ?
it ' s holidays .
we stole the pure heroin , okay ?
it ' s hard to take this victory .
"i can ' t say we ' re screwed .
what do you mean ?
don ' t say "we ' re in your step" again !
protect me .
i ' ll call the lieutenant and ask for backup .
yes , lieutenant !
i ' m detective bailey .

yeah .
exactly .
i won ' t waste your time .
i brought you the best stuff .
this is the best heroin the money can get .
it ' s worth 000 ,000 .
the total price .
there .
"the algo memory" ?
well , listen .
stop .
wayne young got caught in 00 hours and . . .
all $0 .00 .
$0 .00 , actually .
all i have to . . .
like i said , being a cop is a team business .
but there is no living , like water desert .
the hunters here spend their lives looking for rare and hard hunters .
it ' s about 000 pounds of weight , and it ' s the biggest animal ever lived .
despite the huge size of blue whales , blue whales all swimming in all the swimming animals are the most aggressive and energy design .
they can get more than 000 miles a day on the global .
he needs a lot of effort to open his mouth , so he can only see it when he sees it as a rich and busy killer .
feeding chances are usually very rare here .
when it ' s all over , the hunters have to keep searching for me .
frat birds are pirates of the open seas .
the frat birds must be very light because they can ' t have heavy oils that make the feathers of other sea birds .
the little fish are trying to hide among the dead waves , the only guard in the ocean .
the fish that flying through their tailor force of extra fire force can suddenly bark .
with a good wind , they can be smiling hundreds of feet .
all the open ocean hunters can ' t walk around looking for food .
which , she can hardly swim .
this dark yosun fish must be protected from the fish to the ambush .
these ducks in the ocean who don ' t have a specific thing , they ' re gonna see a lot of young fish that want shelter .
first opportunity in weeks .
he can only make a move when you ' re a few inches away from the hunt .
he ' s hiding in the yoses by trusting his perfect camouflage .
the ocean is most interesting that some hunters can only find themselves by searching for their prey as a team .
dolphins live in extremely advanced social group .
they could work together and cover a large area of the ocean .
little groupies sometimes come together , make 0 ,000 superstitions .
they use some kind of radar to find their prey .
but these little fish spend most of their time in the deep ocean , where dolphins can ' t reach .
they ' re only hunting when they ' re on the surface to feed .
once they ' ve found a large pack of dolphins use their radar for another purpose .
as the dolphins feed , they ' re coming from the bottom of the pack to keep their prey from running back into the safest deep .
the more we land down , the food is on the surface , so hunters must do everything they can to protect their precious energy .
most of them are dragged by traces of fatal needles .
the others are slowing down the darkness with the power to push their feathers into the dark .
beroe is the deepest jelly in the deep water .
beroe has special clothes like teeth in her mouth to catch jelat ' s prey .
this deep water ink use long , glowing touchy touchy touchy touchy .
the ocean could be a wide blue desert , but like every desert , there are wilds .
the mountains are forced to surface the food-filled water for the food-and-the-air ocean current heading up to the surface .
it ' s depends on how you make sensitive manoeuvres .
hiding in a flat-edge field , giving their prey a fake sense of trust .
it ' s hard to cut off the lions of the lion ' s lions , so it ' s hard to know how close you are to their prey .
and the exaggerated farts he used to keep his slow tail moves to hide his slow-sided tail moves are even higher .
these deep water details that keep so calm , they also have these wild visitors .
they ' re sending hundreds of miles from the sea mountains , which they ' re using as a summation point in the ocean .
both shark fish species , and galapagos and other seas in the nature of the great ocean , travel among other seas of the earth .
no one knows why they ' re packed so many times , but some certainly come to look for food in these wilds .
if these little fish stay close to the lenta , the dog can ' t access them .
as long as they keep the silver fish close to the ocean floor , they can handle predators .
it ' s never easy to eat in the open ocean .
here , the water that ' s been subjected to the storm , which was stuck to the surface , created by traceable barracks .
it ' s the same size in the same dimension as the black eyebrow colonel fratregat birds , but three times as heavy , it needs a completely different kind of flight .
the colonelatros is a bird with the tallest flare of wings , and that ' s the way the south sea wind can resign from its power .
first , the wind blows against the wind , they use his energy to make it high .
then they come back and buy the wind and win speed .
many times they call hunting , they spend weeks in the sea .
because the wind is so strong here , the colonelatros can ' t afford the weight of the oil that makes them waterproof .
they can dive as much as a duck about a meter , so they tie their prey to the south sea that ' s moving their prey to their range .
like all birds , you have to eggs in the snow in the snow , like all the colonel ' s birds , but there ' s very little handy on the southern ocean , too .
she ' s coming here every year for half a million of the colonel ' s puppies .
grown-ups share their parents '  duty to come back to feed their little puppies in a few days .
when the feed process is over , it ' s time to go to the sea .
the colonel ' s so heavy , they can only cool off where the wind is strong enough .
when it looks out of the air , the ocean may seem unlikely , but under the surface , there ' s always strong minds under the surface .
these accusations are more effective than any other power in the area of life here .
all the organs that were dragged in the ocean , they ' d take it on a way to this flow .
they come together to feed on the fresh plankton and the tiny plant and animals and the accent .
they slow down their feathers from their legs , and they keep swimming up with a couple of tails in their head .
these trifle crabs are carrying these travelling crabs , and the ocean ' s big predators are working on the bus .
they can take the tallest distance , with the perfect aer aerodin , with the longest distance .
these hunters are often touching a shuttle between the ocean accidents where the hunters come together .
every predator has the sensitive smell of the prey that the hunts of the hunters leave behind .
big fish lots of plenty of plenty of plankton are charming .
it could be thousands of miles long .
their self-defense depends on my son .
when the attack came , sardines move like one body .
every fish will fit in at once , and the full time of the pack will move .
they don ' t look like sardines defending coordinates when more sea lion comes in .
the lions of the sea lions have to separate a lot of little controlling group .
but the fish still has the advantage .
all your lions can do is keep the sardines on the surface and wait for the others to join themselves .
tunnels attack from down low , so the sardines cut their way to the deep water .
as the fish squeeze them down , their strategy is now a lot easier for hunters .
a ton of sardines run out in less than an hour .
predators disappear once again in their own paths in blue .
this blue whale is still searching for food to go hungry .
he ' ll have to find an average ton of food in the average day , because that ' sll be a balance big
it ' s a crowd of killers trapped in the face for fish .
this blue whale has finally found what he ' s been looking for .
a big meal to open your big mouth .
she ' s had a pile of cream over hundreds of feet long and a bottom .
he ' s heading up the hunt for the whale ' s most intricate part of his whale .
it ' s a whale that ' s supposed to swim with a totally wide throat , and it ' s got a lot of effort .
he ' s using his tongue out of the whale water to throw his tongue out of his mouth , and he ' s saving them in his bloody plates .
but it takes so much water to wipe it .
blue whales may not be as much as the other hunters , but they don ' t have to be .
no other hunters are more elusive than the rich guys in the mess up the mess they ' re making up with .
blue whaleina is the biggest hunter in the world .
the ocean made a lot of trouble for the "av" crew .
it ' s been a two-year mission to do it .
the team worked with john calamocidis , the most important blue whale expert in the world .
john got some information from these harmless labels .
part of this investigation is part of the investigation and we ' re working with the journalist and why we can ' t afford to get any more scientific data .
so we ' re doing our research through what they ' re doing under water , how they ' re swimming , how they ' re feeding , and how they ' re doing .
the team ' s success depends on a good six-pack .
he ' s so drunk and whale is totally disappearing into the darkness .
we couldn ' t .
the first year , she was impressed by the weakness of the first year , and the shooting failed .
second year marines are better .
blue whales come up only a hundred minutes before they dive in 00 minutes .
he ' s got to try to move the boat ahead of the promenade , but it ' s not right in front of him
then he ' s gonna have to get into david ' s water and hope the whale ' s gonna get close enough to the rock .
this year the water ' s unorth get used to it , but it still takes time to keep david in a good position .
after weeks of weeks after weeks , the end of all the seemes finally come together and give david his chance .
it ' s been a long time before me , so long .
i mean , it was so big , it was like a loaded train .
the blue whale footage under water under water is very rare , so it ' s an enormous success to take a whale swimming in a rock .
this serial hunting has been a beautiful shot , though , but we have to take a picture of the blue whale in order to complete the part .
and we ' re gonna have to wait for the killers to all surface .
maybe once a month , maybe twice .
the team ' s on a promising order , but it ' s a rather unpleasant source .
look at those birds in the water !
we ' ll go take a look .
hey , look !
i don ' t really understand what i just saw .
david saw him , he turned the camera .
he took a turn , went up and bought a big bite .
the reason they call them blue whaleina , you see them under water , the bright , shiny cobbler color of the ocean blue .
i was trying to get another image of the killer upstairs , and the truth is , your mouth is open , one last time .
well , it probably took less than ten minutes , but it ' s probably the most amazing thing i ' ve ever seen without question , without question .
it ' s never gonna happen to me to share water with a blue whale of water , and to come to eye , never forget .
and the opposite turn .
yeah , that ' s a very unique angle we ' ll never see .
because of this intimacy , the team ' s blue whale ' s honeymoones have been seen before , and in the end of the ocean ' s most secret hunted life .
you like her !
no , i don ' t .
every friend i ' ve ever met unstable witnesses likes him .
it ' s pathetic , isn ' t it ?
when mia went as a exchange student , we made a list of our research and cons , and it helped clear our emotions .
yes , ethan karmeov . . .
abigail called and sent out a list of cons .
look , i ' m coming to stay with you for a while .
no , i ' m not gonna get in trouble .
i won ' t stay forever .
okay .
the cleaner frappe .
and petit batament .
everyone thinks the farm is a dangerous place .
shelve .
i know every rabbit hole , broken fence and rusty nails .
and nice ankles .
as soon as i know where i am , i ' m safe .
your wife , tara .
and blance .
everybody in line .
tara , you can join us .
but the academy is a completely different world .
if you think you know your way , think again .
you ' ll realize you ' re in a minefield .
wherever i come back i see a new trap . . .
"it smells like christmas . . .
"the way he eats .
" everything he ' s talking about is true ."
could it be worse ?
yes , as you ask . . .
at least i ' m not the first one on your list .
i think i should be grateful for that .
i ' m really sorry , kat .
i didn ' t want you involved in my confusion .
believe me , i tried so hard not to feel like this .
that ' s a good reason .
my brother will break your heart , and when he does , i won ' t be there to fix the pieces .
i promise i ' ll stay away from her .
do you think abigail sent them to third grade ?
ethan read .
kill me .
yes , a question for you .
who can tell me the real meaning of deaux ?
pas deaux .
it means a lot of dancing .
but what does the word beyond french words mean , metaphorically ?
pas deaux .
two bodies , one soul .
a man and a woman dancing with pure and simple feelings .
this is what our lesson is about today .
i never danced with a man before .
right .
at home , girls danced with girls .
no men .
men in first class are just lovely creatures that crushed their fingers .
pas deaux has three important rules .
trust .
take a horse .
together .
great great great great great great great great
and most important of all , communication .
without these , yes . . . without these , yes . . .
ethan , isabelle , it ' s very nice of you to join .
remember , to be together , you need to trust and communicate .
do your hands always do that ?
i ' m allergic to you .
focus on who you ' re dancing with .
no one else should matter .
you want to drop it ?
relax .
you do very well .
what great class ?
i mean , patrick is such a great teacher .
don ' t you think the universe is trying to bring us together ?
la-la-la-la-la .
before you leave , miss raine and i talked about you not having a lesson for the rest of your day .
don ' t get excited .
instead , you ' ll make an exercise for me .
remember , just as you ' re in your other lessons , you ' re gonna be able to consider it without a snack .
that was a hit !
i ' m going to be wandering a dog with eyes .
at least you don ' t have to spend 00 hours with abigail like me .
i ' d rather see my eyes with a blind blade .
i know . 00 hours we ' ll ask our wives 00 questions .
this ?
" one of you may ask any questions any questions any questions any of you may ask any questions
"but honestly you must answer honestly ."
like i wanted to know something about christian .
so you ' re not alone .

i know all about you .
your whole school is being run alive .

and there ' s a second step .
has anyone ever been to the city ?
have you ever kissed a man ?
you didn ' t kiss , did you ?
maybe i can help you .
maybe you can get out of my sight .
hey , i ' ve got questions more to ask .
and i ' m trying to make my stomach stronger .
we can make these on the beach .
i can ' t come to the beach .
are you allergic to fresh air ?
i don ' t like the sand , i don ' t like salt and i don ' t like the sun .
great .
i need water .
me too .
we hate you enough to ask you to die of thirst .
i don ' t care what his favorite color or his family did .
so did she say anything to you ?
he did it !
"oh , let ' s go to the beach to do homework .
"it ' ll be so much fun !"
i didn ' t know he ' d be here .
really .
what are you doing here ?
we come to our own third grade .
you don ' t have to be screaming here right now .
you can play with us if you want .
i may be blinded , but i ' m not blind .

i think i ' m staying .
i haven ' t finished with christian yet .

no , i can ' t keep it for 00 hours .
i ' m starving .
yeah , me too .
i just . . .
i ' m gonna go get some food .
this place is closed against smoking .

why does men have to smell so bad in the men ' s room ?
why do you have to be so bad ?
that ' s right .
they smell bad .
more than you did and more than you did .
just think , and you and i both finish your job fast before you die of oxygen .
i can ' t , please do a song or something ?
hurry up .
i still can ' t understand why you sent that list to everyone .
you ' re just as uncomfortable as a fliesy fly all the time .
it just made you look bad .
okay , don ' t say anything .
there you go .
hey , where ' s tara ?
i don ' t know .
huh .
whoa !
hey , baby .
i ' ve got a bedroom in my lap .
hey !
i wrote this , princess !
come on , we ' ll catch them later .
you want to die ?
did you see what they tried to do to me ?
you can ' t keep a fight around here .
anyway , what are you still doing here ?
if you wanted to know , i was waiting for the bus .
what ' d you see me in a limo ?
you don ' t know anything about me .
i don ' t think i want to know .
i ' ve never met anyone as rude as you .
didn ' t your mother teach you your instincts ?
he ' s dead .
look , if you ' re curious , all you have to do is call .
who said i was curious ?
just checking my messages .
what do you know ?
i can understand everything .
this communication thing must have started to work .
yeah ?
can you see this ?
ow .
i can ' t imagine what losing your mother means .
no , you can ' t .
was she dancing ?
yeah , he was young .
is that why you wanted to get into the academy ?
will you leave ?
i won ' t .
i don ' t believe you .
i saw how you danced !
right .
she lives in brenoken hill .
very good .
and let ' s say i got in trouble .
i don ' t know , probably .
you said you were close .
so you ' re saying he answered , right ?
your brothers help your brothers ?
maybe he ' ll call her .
but when the room calls another number , it ' s because she doesn ' t know i ' m me .
now you know everything .
is that right ?
i would mean wrong , but . . .
see , you learned nothing .
my brother and i are very close .
i have one question left .
00 question .
let ' s ask .
why did you tell everyone i was dressed in the wrong locker room ?
you knew it was by mistake .
why would i bother ?
i don ' t believe you , you ' re still lying about it .
i know you did .
you know , i wasn ' t the only man there .
have you thought about it ?
tara , what were you thinking ?
you think . . . ?
do you think it says 0-0 or 00 ?
it says two and four hours .
you want to know why i ' m bad against tara ?
because you three are so stupid !
i need to talk to you .
like you don ' t know .
you were laughing behind me all this time , weren ' t you ?
excuse me ?
you said i was in the wrong locker room for the audition week .
it was you , wasn ' t it ?
come on , admit it was a funny thing .
and leave me in the beach alone ?
it ' s fun , isn ' t it ?
but you weren ' t with us .
they searched , and you wouldn ' t give an answer to my list ?
i didn ' t realize i needed an answer .
of course you were supposed to .
the whole school laughs at me because of you .
why should it be because of me ?
look , if you want to hear the truth , i ' m ashamed of that list .
i mean , we only talked to you three or four times , right ?
and you went and wrote and sent it to the whole school .
i don ' t even know you .
tara ?
tara ?
he can ' t talk to you .
yes , he can .
i thought you were sick of the girls coming to you after ethan .
because i hate seeing my friends sad .
growing up , my parents warned me of all the danger .
we have to realize everything here ourselves . . .
prove to me yesterday wasn ' t a waste of time .
good work , boys .
whether we like it or not , we ' re connected to the ropes that won ' t cut each other for the next year .
so we have a long way ahead of us .
morning .
morning , bette .
mm-hmm .
get dressed .
i want to be there when they open it .
okay .
i already had a candy .
just one .
here ' s your napkin .
you want butter ?
here .
morning .
be careful .
here ' s the inspector .
good morning , miss tremont .
good morning , mr korman .
mr . tremont .
hi .
yeah .
what can i do for you , miss tremont ?
it says here the pork chops sell it .
in the meantime , they ' re all in commercials .
how are those pig chops ?
we don ' t sell them .
there ' s only pork chops in commercial , mr korman .
no pictures , no id numbers .
so what do you want , miss tremont ?
i want these pork chops from that price .
all right .
jake .
hey !
jake .
oh . . . ah . . . ah . . . ah . . .
first of all , i ' m sorry that this is on you , john , but we have a staff problem that you should know .
this guy can ' t decide between us and goldman .
i know you hate this , but you need to come in here and use your magic wand .
that good ?
let ' s not miss this guy .
these kids from business school think they ' re worth a thousand dollars a week when they work for a week .
i hate these attitude .
okay , get kathy to it by the end of the week .
i got notes for the next day .
the vale project gave us a lot of direction , but the management suggesting that the investors shouldn ' t have any idea why the company is so profound .
they don ' t want to give a lot of information to their competition .
i don ' t know why we have to cooperate with this guy in vale .
a dark type .
we ' re risking your company ' s reputation .
if we refuse him , we ' ll never get a job from him again .
he ' s demanding a giant payment and the banking office wants this job .
i ' m worried about my share this year .
lower the price .
i think it ' s the early span of the record on the snow pouse .
yeah ?
your sister , even , mr . tremont .
he says it ' s important .
he had to talk to you right away .
i ' m at a meeting .
john , this is about our mother .
he had a heart attack .
right now , but he ' s serious .
can you come ?
hey !
how was the flight ?
good one .
the guy next to me didn ' t leave me alone .
he heard me from wall street , so don ' t ask .
"how ' s this stock ?
i understand .
have you heard of a chrometex ?
mario .
seriously , someone told me about the math department .
they ' re building heat sensors for the low-storms that work in low temperature .
it ' ll be bigger than the phone .
no .
no ?
no .
good .
at home with your father .
home first or hospital ?
it doesn ' t matter .
let ' s go to the hospital .
that ' s what i thought .
how ' s dad ?
to be honest , johnny , he ' s a little shaken up .
that ' s why annie ' s staying with him .
he doesn ' t want her to be alone .
so how ' s mom ?
how serious is she ?
he can ' t accept that he actually had a heart attack .
he ' s lying there because of a heart attack , and he claims he ' s a treasure .
he blames me .
what do you mean ?
she says it ' s because of the sausages i made for dinner .
he claims i tried to kill him .
did you ?
no jury can blame me , john .
i believe you .
if you came here , i ' m pretty sick .
look , mom , that ' s why you ' re the best .
in your case , many people wouldn ' t feel guilty .
how are you ?
any pain ?
i ' m alive with my grandfather .
he ' ll tell you .
i have the will of a woman half my age .
don ' t eat yourself .
did you see your father ?
no , i came straight from the airport .
if you see him , don ' t say anything about heart attack .
just tell me something ' s wrong with me .
okay ?
mom .
listen to me .
just tell her something ' s wrong with me .
my priest will know i ' m sleeping because he ' s taken .
okay .
if you have to eat outside , go to thecdonalds or wendy ' s .
somewhere simple .
mom , you shouldn ' t worry about dad right now .
i think you should think about yourself right now .
you had a heart attack .
i ' m not sure i had a heart attack .
it hurts me like it ' s more gas pains .
mom , if it was a gas pills , they ' d give you acid .
they wouldn ' t tie you to $00 million .
did you see the doctor taking care of me ?
because i don ' t believe he ' s a real doctor .
he was wearing a tight pants with a silver toe in his big belt .
he can ' t be more than 00 .
they ' re now grading everyone from medical school .
john !
god , good to see you .
you came and saw your mother first , huh ?
yeah .
how she looks at you , john , tell me the truth .
like my mother .
it was as if he was gonna drag his hanging serum bottles and get out of there .
i mean , it ' s just a gas boxer .
i bet that ' s what she told you .
and the will ?
like a half-year-old woman .
you look very modern .
where shall i put your bags , sir ?
ah , put it over there .
thank you very much .
there ' s no suitcase in the living room .
you know the rules .
i ' m taking them to your old bedroom .
is the living room still forbidden ?
you ' re kidding .
this looks exactly like the smithsons .
dad ' s outside , huh ?
yeah , green home .
what ' s he doing there ?
mario told me he was very difficult to accept .
he ' s scared , john .
she ' s really , really scared .
i ' m not sure you understand what ' s going on .
what do you mean ?
she saw him , didn ' t she ?
i didn ' t want to drag her there .
i told her you didn ' t accept visitors , and she seems to understand that .
hi , dad .
hello , john .
good to see you .
you look good .
good to see you too .
i ' ll stay here a few days .
did you hear what happened to your mother ?
how is he ?
good .
good .
he asked me to say hello and he said he ' ll be home soon .
something ' s wrong with your body , right ?
something like that .
your old room doesn ' t work well , you know .
you should use a second blanket .
okay .
as long as you ' re here , the most important thing is to make sure everything goes well .
your mother has a backup and her life is really a long rut .
and a candy .
they ' ll cut a cup off in the morning , make a shopping list .
this is important .
i wrote you a list of pills .
when did he get so bad ?
it ' s been a year since i saw him .
no , you ' re wrong .
what are you saying ?
i was here on christmas .
annie , i need to know .
okay , i saw him two years ago .
a lot happens in two years .
why didn ' t you tell me ?
i tried to take her to us , but she couldn ' t be comfortable .
we both work all day .
but here ' s the garden and green house .
he knows the environment .
i can only stay here a few days .
then what do we do ?
can ' t you stay longer ?
i have to go to boston .
no way .
we have to bring someone home .
but we have to find the right person .
my father ' s old , john .
yeah .
come on , dad , let ' s hit the head , shall we ?
johnny .
i can ' t find my pajamas .
i don ' t know where your mother put them .
here .
why don ' t you put them on , dad ?
i will .
are you okay ?
i miss your mother .
he ' ll get what he needs .
good rest .
he ' ll be home soon .
good night .
good night .
hold the lights on .
okay .
sleep well .
i don ' t eat any more in the morning , johnny .
it was still good .
thanks , dad .
you ' re cooking a lot at home , aren ' t you ?
not really .
i ' ve been eating out since sara and i got divorced .
yeah , she was a nice girl .
still is .
how ' s billy ?
right now in santa cruz .
first class in college .
she came to visit once .
so you saw him more than i ever saw .
look at this , johnnie .
double cupcake day at ralph ' s today .
two boxes of tuna $0 .00 .
amazing .
how much is it in new york ?
$0 .00 , i bet .
no , i don ' t agree .
no way .
listen , dad , i want to talk to you about mom for a minute .
you have something important to understand .
my mother ' s sick .
it ' s not cancer , is it ?
no , no , not cancer .
cancer kills , you know .
your uncle has been in surgery five times .
nothing was done to her .
look , i ' m telling you if you cancer , you gotta pack your bags .
look , it ' s not cancer .
a heart attack .
is she gonna be okay ?
yeah , he ' ll be fine .
but he ' s not gonna work hard like before .
he ' s gonna have to learn to take it slow and you need to help him with it .
i always tell him you worked too hard .
johnny , he works very hard .
you need to know a few things you can do at home .
look , my mother made you believe that no one else could look after you .
we ' re gonna try to fix this wrong .
i understand , johnny .
i ' ll know how to do all this .
you ' ll see .
we ' re gonna make fun of her .
okay , dad , what we have to do fox , let ' s see ,
"suck the elders out of the whites ." ." ." ."
so dark matter isn ' t involved in white color .
understood .
i think that ' s what your mother would do .
now we know we ' re on the right track .
okay , now let ' s start with the colours , okay ?
these are colored .
color .
white , color , color .
white .
color .
color .
and this ?
him ?
that white .
okay , this color .
dad , he must be one of these .
i think we should call your mother .
i ' m gonna do a job here .
okay .
what do you think we got ?
"e , normal .
i ' m gonna go with "harry ."
what kind of water should we use ?
"the cold , cold , cold , cold , cold-fed , p-p-p-puss ."
what the hell is that ?
warm .
i think it was white .
the thursday will be ready .
yeah .
what ' s the easy way to get to the market here , dad ?
i don ' t really know these streets , john .
your mother will take us anywhere we have to go .
you never drive ?
nothing ?
i can ' t .
my license expired a few years ago .
you didn ' t get any other license ?
well , they asked me to pass on a test test for my age .
did you screw the test ?
i disagree .
i was afraid i couldn ' t pass .
what are you saying ?
you used a great car .
johnny , a good driver , you know when you can ' t drive , that ' s all .
i can ' t remember what you liked , so i ' ve got less than anything .
great .
well . . .
these are beautiful .
i want to see your mother , johnny .
i don ' t think that ' s a good idea right now , dad .
i mean , my mother ' s fine , but they wouldn ' t want to accept visitors .
i ' m her husband .
i need to see her .
that ' s not true .
perfect .
he made me breakfast this morning .
no , i ' m not serious .
i don ' t know , it ' s a box .
yeah .
everything ' s fine .
okay , bye .
okay , dad .
annie will see you at the hospital .
or he thinks they can let you see in a day or two .
good .
yeah .
what ?
i can wash dishes .
i ' ve put these cards in the color .
there ' s a different code card here for a day house business .
for example , now , the pink ones to wash dishes .
go ahead , take a look and see the number .
number one: number one: number one:
"fill water the water with water .""""" " "
okay .
number two ?
"tu some patience ."
okay .
"hach the stomach contents ."
i prepared these for your own work .
these are great , johnny .
if i follow these cards , there ' s no reason for me to make a mistake .
i ' ll watch these .
i ' ll show you how to light the stove , dad .
no , on the other side , it ' s off-limits now .
no october .
and stay away from blender . . .
no apprentices .
i think i should work with this .
your mother wouldn ' t want me to wear this .
i look so mean .
like johnny cash .
you don ' t think that , do you ?
no , dad , i don ' t think so .
don ' t take your guns to town , son .
drop those guns at home .
bang .
"fill the carabo ." "loo the car
it ' s a professional sewers , dad .
you can see yourself in the ground .
there ' s no trace of cila sarasm .
you know what i think ?
i think we should reward ourselves .
what do you mean ?
let ' s go out and have a good time .
what are you saying ?
okay .
okay .
what do you and mom do to have fun here ?
"i" 00 . 00 . 00 . 00 . 00 . 00 . 00 . 00 .

well , good to see you again .
it ' s been a while .

nice to meet you .
they ' re like a breath of fresh air .
i also know your bingos .
you haven ' t been here long , have you , father ?
when was the last time you played here ?
three years .
you ' re kidding .
why did you stop coming ?
i don ' t know .
we used to have so much fun with your mother , but . . .
we don ' t do things we love anymore .
i don ' t know why .
i think you should remember the things you ' re enjoying and start doing them again .
that ' s a good idea .
john , i ' m gonna write this down .
i ' m gonna make a list of what we enjoy .
yes , sir .
bingo .
what ?
i think you did bingo .
hey , i got bingom !
i was worried about you , john .
i ' m afraid you ' re gonna be a nipple .
we need to take a look at this .
we can win , and we can get a regular win .
i know a computer boy in new york , consult him .
it ' s great with numbers .
he ' ll build a system for us .
you ' ll see .
we ' re gonna beat these guys , dad .
i ' m sorry , i didn ' t mean to leave you so late .
it ' s like christmas night .
the only thing missing here is guy lombardo .
he ' s dead .
no , hal mccarthy didn ' t mention it .
big day tomorrow .
we better go to bed .
good night , john .
good night , dad .
"b 0 0 "b" 0 0 0
and then .
there they are , dad .
hi , dad .
you ' re kidding me .
are you ready to see him , father ?
i can ' t believe dad looks so good .
is that what you think ?
thanks to you , john .
i ' m good because of him .
that was fun .
listen , i hired someone to take care of the house .
he ' ll be one day .
i can stay home until my mom gets home .
really ?
yeah , no big deal .
hey , bette .
are you okay ?
mm-hmm .
you swallow your blood pressure pills ?
are you eating ?
yeah , i ' m fine , bette .
i can do my own bed now .
i wash dishes too .
john ' s teaching me how to cook .
he ' s like a real wife .
just keep him alive until i get back .
thanks for your name .
my mom looks good , right ?
yeah , great .
i can ' t go anywhere without my skin .
i meant your face color , mom .
my color ?
what are you , a decorator ?
don ' t call me mom .
am i calling you "son" ?
don ' t be so kind to my mother , mario .
you ' re gonna kill him .
why are you cooking ?
there was dinner in the fridge .
i told you .
we wanted a little change , that ' s all .
we ate salmon the other night .
we ate  ' coq au vin the night before .
your father doesn ' t like foreign food .
just a red wine chicken .
that red wine shouldn ' t drink .
mom , that was it .
i don ' t want her to become a alcohol when i ' m here .
nobody eats aq au vin , nobody ' s a drunk .
easy , bette .
don ' t worry about everything .
just focus on getting better here and don ' t worry about me .
you sure you want to come , dad ?
it ' s going to be a long meeting .
no , i will .
good for me .
i can buy you a lunch here and watch movies .
i ' m gonna sit down , read a magazine .
i ' ll be fine .
okay .
i want to see john tremont , vic walton , please .
he ' s waiting for you .
dad , are you gonna be able to relax here among your repairs ?
yeah , nobody ' s gonna make me fall for it .
john , good to see you .
sorry about the mess .
good to see you too , vic .
this is my father , jake tremmont .
dad , this is vic walton .
nice to meet you , mr . tremont .
me too .
should we be here in an hour ?
like i said .
okay , take care , dad .
wait , wait a minute .
we can ' t leave your father here .
come on , mr . tremont , why don ' t you come in and sit with us ?
i think- i think- i- i think
ralph , we gave you all the privileges and now our wife thinks you ' re about 00 percent less than you now .
how can you be so sure of yourself ?
you-you ' ve never followed anything like this before .
and if you ' re wrong , we ' re gonna be the mask of the atmosphere and we ' re never gonna do business with you again .
forget about running the concert factory .
he ' s losing money every minute he ' s staying open , but the land on him is worth at least $00 million .
how can you be so sure of $00 million ?
we can leave it to $00 million .
do you have any information ?
now can i get back to the subject ?
we don ' t have a problem with all the transplants around 00 million dollars worth of real value .
they can take over all the generals , but the plan we have on our hand shows that we have to remove 00% of the director ' s staff in a few months .
isn ' t just enough to sell ?
this way , the accounting records will do .
if this goes well , there ' s no need for that .
i don ' t think they focus on that .
we can change that .
and the other thing about the food balls , it ' s a good industry .
now , our cash transplant plans seem to be intolerable , but it ' s not exactly satisfying .
when we account for everything , we don ' t have a problem getting credit from the banks .
yeah , that looks good .
johnny , what ' s going on out there ?
well , we ' re gonna buy a salmon fish concert , dad .
i didn ' t know you had information about something like this .
actually , i don ' t know .
we don ' t have the knowledge of the man who came for money .
we ' re just gonna get the company and then we ' re gonna put an end to it .
is this your job ?
you ' re buying , and then you hang up ?
it ' s kind of complicated , dad .
we ' re getting this concert factory .
then the company ' s messed up .
this third generator ' s going down the board , and it ' s terrifying .
but they have a little paravan company , and that ' s the finger .
the factory is built near a valuable land .
so we take the factory , close the door , then take over to the parraavan company , and then we sell the land .
and you ' ve never thought of running these parties ?
there ' s no money in that , dad .
the world ' s changed , johnny .
you can ' t believe the world ' s changed .
remember when you were a little boy and you went to work with me to locheed ?
i broke out of the shells of the rude .
they ' d give me 00 cents a day , and i ' d buy a ham-and-fried cheese sandwich .
when you grew up with me there , you said you wanted to work on the one .
but now you buy your job and then you shut it down .
did you hear about those loccheed men , father ?
rick malinson ?
tommy williams ?
they all moved out .
to the valley , palms spring . . .
there was nobody there to say goodbye to me .
the next morning , there was no one who did what i did .
the world group in two group: the world group:
and the bosses and the bosses .
i don ' t know , dad , i-i-i-
everything ' s fine , johnny .
there ' s nothing wrong here .
i ' m a worker , that ' s all .
but you ' re different .
you like to be in control .
you like to take responsibility .
you ' re a boss .
mom ?
what do you think ?
okay , dad .
"if you park a car parked a car and you don ' t find the owner ' s owner . . .
why are you doing this ?
i ' ve already passed the written test .
i know , but you may not be too careful .
a lot of these samples here could be in driver ' s license exam .
i want to prepare you for this .
very good .
thank you .
we ' ve come this far .
i don ' t want to see something wrong now .
they want us to pull over there .
move .
slow , slow , not so fast .
okay , stop .
there he is .
jake tremont ?
actually , it ' s jake tremont .
i ' m his son , john .
i guess you didn ' t need to know that , but you heard it .
you can ' t sit here during the test , sir .
oh , i ' m sorry .
oh , you can ' t stay in the car either .
what are you talking about ?
this is my father .
that ' s the rules .
i ' m not doing a test for as long as you sit in the car .
now you take it out , or your father will fail the test .
everything okay ?
you ' ll be fine .
as you get out of your car park-- traffic--
john ?
i ' m leaving .
i ' ll check the bikes and the other cars .
yes !
while you ' re waiting on the left turn , give them a priority to the cars from the area .
make sure all the dangerous cars are through .
yes !
oh , look who ' s here .
hey , dad .
hey , billy .
hey . . .
my grandmother was ill .
i just ran .
i thought you might need me , grandpa .
don ' t even think about helping your grandfather out .
when was the last time you had lunch ?
why do you americans have such obsession with food ?
you know , when in rome . . .
what were you doing in mexico ?
semen vacation .
some friends over there .
dad , you say that every time we see each other .
and i ' ve been growing up for two years .
how ' s your mother ?
good .
third year of law and class .
it ' s embarrassing if your mother gets more than you , but we work .
send my love .
how are you ?
sometimes you win , sometimes you lose .
if i know you , you ' re winning more than you lost .
if you ' re finished , let ' s take a piece of cake .
she looks great .
what ' s going on ?
well , we ' re spending a lot of time together .
pretty good time , huh ?
they say it ' s good for parents and children .
maybe you and i should spend more time together .
this looks great here , grandpa .
you put too much .
you look good .
i ' m gonna name this after you , bill .
who wants butter ?
want some butter , honey ?
i want to make a toast .
aha .
a lot has happened in the last two weeks .
we ' ve dealt with some of the hardships , and we ' ve had some pain .
we had them all as a team .
now thanks time .
great , mario .
that ' s not my usual speech .
actually , i just want to say that it ' s nice to see our family together and be happy .
my chicken ' s getting cold .
it ' s over .
very good .
i propose a toast .
hmm .
wow , dad .
to my dear bride .
your future ?
have you been drinking today , jake ?
before you came , mother , mother , we drank acoq au vin .
my dear bride . . .
bette , welcome back to our family , where you are .
it ' s so good to be home .
listen .
good talk , dad .
it ' s great that everyone ' s here .
and i don ' t remember the last time john billy and i were together .
billy looks good .
i like that earring .
should i wear it too ?
i ' ve got a needle if you want to .
oh , leave her alone , mom .
looks great .
i bet they ' re gonna jump on girls .
don ' t worry about me .
that ' s not embarrassing .
the dorm ' s boyfriendly .
is that right ?
yeah , we ' re in our dorm and the girl-man ' s complicated .
good thing we didn ' t have that in our time .
if i were , i wouldn ' t finish school .
as if you were a student to me .
mario was a great student , mom .
she graduated physically .
he didn ' t even read the book , and he begged .
yeah , but all the good students also read me a book and ended up begging .
but john was a good student .
thanks , mommy .
every friday we would go to the library .
we ' d take 0 books .
you read them , we ' d give them back , and we ' d get 0 new books .
you did more than that .
so how did it work ?
were the girls on the other floor ?
somebody shut that man down .
i ' m just happy .
let ' s make it easy for grandma and grandpa while you ' re here .
sure , you ' re used to hearing it , but you can ' t believe it ' s real .
i believe , believe me .
my fillings are still running .
i ' m sorry .
so when do you have to go back to school ?
i ' m not going back to school .
i ' m thinking of hanging out in mexico for a while .
what ' s mexico ' s joke ?
all mexicans try to come here .
did you know that ?
some kids from school are there .
they ' re very similar .
that ' s good .
yeah , fun , but believe it or not , but you ' re gonna want to work one day , bill .
lying on the coast of mexico isn ' t gonna do any good for you .
if you don ' t want to be a mariachi sing , you have to finish a school .
i ' d say i went to college .
i got the doctor .
i did the right thing .
two doctor degrees .
one chemical , one of them is physically .
i ' ll be back in new york soon , and i want to make it right .
what does your mother think ?
he thinks i can make my own decision .
i ' m not sure how i feel about this .
we need to talk more about this .
i don ' t understand why .
i ' ve never been talked about it so far , and i know what i want .
johnny , something ' s wrong .
can you come here and take a look ?
that ' s enough , mr . tremont .
you can get dressed if you want .
is he ok ?
yeah , good .
it ' s a tired process .
it hasn ' t spread yet .
what do you think the question is ?
maybe one of a few things .
i suspect he ' s in urine cuts .
the problem is that he ' s not good at walking .
is this gonna show up on your tests ?
not completely .
it ' s not a good sign .
so it ' s serious ?
i think we should get him out of a general operation .
if the problem was serious , father , they wouldn ' t leave you .
they ' d open it up and they ' d surgery under spots .
i wouldn ' t be surprised if it ' s only one .
i don ' t think we should tell mom .
why worry ?
whatever you say , johnny .
you ' re the boss .
he told you , didn ' t he ?
of course she did .
then you know there ' s nothing serious about that .
if it wasn ' t serious , you should have told me yourself .
look , mom , you gotta stay away from some kind of stress this time .
you ' re gonna be sorry .
that ' s why i didn ' t tell you .
he ' s just saying it ' s aist .
that ' s right .
it ' s gonna be a simple operation .
yes , it is .
mom , if something went wrong , i ' d tell you .
sure .
okay .
am i gonna walk around here like this , john , all the nurses here , and i ' m gonna walk around like every nurse in here ?
yeah .
that ' s what it says on the accepting form here ,
"missy is law ."
go to bed .
you need to sign this , dad .
what is this ?
i don ' t have any baseball gloves .
that was bad .
doctor santana prepared these meds .
it ' ll only help you relax .
i ' ll take a piece if you have too much .
he paid extra for the private room .
what time ?
it ' s night .
is it later ?
no .
are you cool , dad ?
fine .
let me rest a bit .
well , that puts you asleep like a baby .
okay .
remember , if you need anything , just step on it .
is that all ?
you ' ll be fine .
you know , john , i see some men , they hug each other .
we ' ve never hugged .
shall we try ?
come on .
i love you , johnny .
me too , dad .
well , mr . tremmont , i ' m afraid it ' s cancer .
cancer .
we ran into a couple of bad guys .
your father won ' t be one year old .
well , it ' s a silly question , but are you sure about this ?
yeah .
the good thing is we can reach him and destroy it .
listen , dr . santana .
whatever you do , don ' t tell dad you have cancer .
he ' s very alarming and very afraid of that word .
say something more reasonable .
calm down , mr . tremont .
you ' d be surprised what others have been through .
they don ' t care about it .
i ' m not underestimate this , doc .
i just want to tell him myself , that ' s all .
this cancer , right ?
mom , i told you .
it ' s only an hour and they ' ll take it .
i want to see him .
mom !
mom , you can ' t see her right now .
will you listen to me ?
you shouldn ' t be stressed like that .
if everything ' s fine , let me see him .
come on , mom !
john only wants your best .
you know .
you should listen to her , mom .
he ' s my husband and i ' ll see him .
now you take me there , or i walk , but i ' m gone .
what ' s there ?
billy , go find dr . santana fast .
come on !
get out of here .
what happened to him ?
jake , it ' s me !
why didn ' t she know me ?
jake !
mr . tremont , this is dr . santana .
do you know who i am ?
i ' m fine .
i ' m fine now , thanks .
give me 00 mortgages and check it in at two hours .
okay , doc .
this is exactly the same thing as the other patients .
they go into shock after every simple operation .
is that standard ?
do you know what ' s going on inside ?
i know this is a frightening experience for you , but what you have to understand is this whole situation here .
she couldn ' t have come here .
why now ?
it ' s strange .
and he will .
that kind of stress suddenly happens .
i ' m sure a good rest and he ' ll be fine with the medication .
what are we gonna do ?
nothing .
what do you mean something ?
we ' ll wait for him to answer the medication .
did you tell dad you had cancer ?
he has the right to know that .
i don ' t know exactly what you asked me for , mr . tremont .
dr ethhridge ,
i don ' t trust santana .
you ' re the hospital manager , and what i ' d like to say is that he ' s not comfortable with us .
your doctor is a good young surgeon .
it seems he ' s perfectly and professional about your father .
i told him that he never told my dad he had cancer because he ' s scared of that word .
but what he did , he just left and told him .
yeah , that ' s hard for every doctor to say .
he has to have the balance of your father ' s rights to knowledge your father ' s family members of his family ' s family ' s family ' s
i ' m sure he had no choice .
he had a choice .
he should have listened to me .
i know my father .
why did you tie her arms ?
not to hurt yourself .
he was hitting himself with his hands .
well , then , i ' m his son and i don ' t think he needs them .
let us know when you ' re ready , so we can get him to bed .
i can ' t believe this .
hey , dad , how you doing ?
is it always like this ?
look , look , look , i brought annie .
and billy ' s here .
hey , dad .
how are you feeling , dad ?
can you hear me ?
hey , grandpa , it ' s me , billy .
how ' s it going ?
god , john , i can ' t stand being here when she looks like this .
i think that ' s enough .
i gave him an excuse .
that will calm her down .
how long has it been like this ?
all the time we ' ve been here .
was she depressed ?
god , doc .
good thing you ' re not a detective .
yeah , she seemed depressed .
what the hell is going on in this goddamn place ?
i mean , i meant something extraordinary , mr . tremont .
mr . tremont--
don ' t keep telling me his situation is extraordinary , doc .
it ' s not depressed depressing , it ' s true , but the glue will bring him to himself .
sedative ?
he ' s hallucinating .
he ' s yelling .
he doesn ' t know any family , and you just gave him a sedative ?
why didn ' t you give him a cake ?
maybe his throat hurts too !
we ' ve decided to treat your father tomorrow .
you can pick him up after 00:00 .
what do you mean , "taburi" ?
you want to tell me my father ' s healing ?
well , of course not , but i don ' t think we have anything we can do to her .
we can ' t take the beds for the patients we can ' t help the medical road .
how do we know ?
he didn ' t get any medical help !
what exactly do you mean ?
what i said .
so they don ' t care if they ' re dead .
what kind of talk is that ?
didn ' t think-
just relax .
you want my father out of here ?
look what i ' m gonna do .
i ' ll do better than you can .
it ' s clear you can ' t look after him .
john , what are you doing ?
mr . tremont- don ' t touch him .
that ' s not necessary .
i ' m saying i ' ll take her home .
mr . tremont , what you ' re doing is very unpredictable .
what do we do now ?
i don ' t know .
we don ' t have much choice but--
no , i don ' t want to do that .
i don ' t want to bring her to a home .
me too , john , but we have to do something .
wait a second , john .
you can ' t help him in this situation .
i think i can do that .
i ' ll do better than the hospital could .
i ' ll stay and help .
no .
why not ?
i ' ll take care of him .
he ' s my father .
well , he ' s my grandfather too .
i ' m your father too .
i don ' t want you here right now , billy .
you shouldn ' t see this .
dad , i ' m not a kid .
look , i think you should go .
go back to school , go back to mexico .
you ' re from here .
don ' t you understand ?
yes , i understand .
i want to talk to him .
i don ' t think this is a good idea right now , mom , really .
annie ' s right , mom .
here ' s to the funeral car .
you ' d like that , wouldn ' t you , mario ?
i mean , "babia , get in , mom ."
it was just a slipper .
he ' ll be fine .
john will take care of him .
let ' s go , dad .
this gooden boy is great , right ?
stili reminds me of bob gibson .
you know , a real player .
you got him , dad ?
good .
here we go .
the mine .
we ' re gonna have to work on the boat .
okay .
what you need is some home food .
well , i think you ' re right .
wait till you taste this .
come on , dad .
okay .
hmm , okay .
there .
try this .
come on , dad , bite a piece .
come on , there you go .
let ' s try our luck .
dad , you can ' t bite things from window .
house rules .
you don ' t like it there , do you ?
neither do i .
we ' ll be fine , huh ?
come on , dad .
that ' s better .
okay , dad .
wait a minute so i can lay you down .
i ' ll just put these in there .
why are we here , ed ?
why aren ' t we farm ?
what ?
you know , if we stay , they ' ll wonder , you know .
where ' s the owner ?
this is your home , dad .
what are you talking about ?
mandy didn ' t come back from the meow , ed .
i ' m worried about him .
well , don ' t worry , dad .
i-i ' m sure she ' s okay .
you think so ?
yeah .
i need 00 nails for the chicken , so help me .
it has to be done now .
look .
what we need right now is a good night ' s sleep .
you always say when there ' s a problem:
"let ' s go to bed ."
so we have problems now , dad .
let ' s go to bed .
dad ?
dad ?
dad ?
dad , where are you ?
dad ?
dad ?
dad ?
dad ?
what do you think you ' re doing here , huh ?
oh , dad , come on , let me help you .
come on , dad , come on .
no .
dad , i ' m gonna lift the bed .
come on .
come on , dad , get out .
dad , come on .
i got you .
shh .
come on .
shh .
i got you , i got you .
i got you .
mr . tremont ?
i understand you brought your father back to the hospital .
yeah .
i thought it would be hard to look at her at home .
that ' s no place for him now .
he can ' t do it at home , can ' t here , can he ?
maybe he ' d better take a chopper on the hill and take a ride .
i know it ' s hard to accept the children ' s parents are old .
what that means .
i know what age is .
mr . tremmont , you remember the doctors are human .
we can ' t deal with all the problems .
we can ' t save every patient .
we live in a system where old people have finally been forced into the most difficult .
what is your request ?
why are you here ?
there ' s another doctor in this hospital .
i think he can do better than dr . santana .
what ?
i ' m kicking everything they say .
he ' s a good man .
i want him to take a look at your father .
mr . tremont ?
mr . tremont ?
how do you do , mr . tremont ?
let ' s do a few tricks .
let ' s have an eg , and we ' ll locate the metab breaks .
let ' s give him the stay-mut-meznium , and we ' re gonna do a life-thinking test
i ' m not so sure what caused this , but right now i ' m diagnosed with the fact that it ' s a epileptic .
the question is , what caused this ?
and why not ?
if you ' re asking us to make any other talk about it , please do it .
no , that ' s not necessary .
well , don ' t think we ' re gonna sit in our place and do nothing .
we don ' t think so .
we ' ve done a series of tests so far and we ' ll do more .
so far all we ' ve done is shoot into darkness .
i appreciate your humility , doctor .
but these tests have been done long , haven ' t they ?
she ' s gonna sleep here for a while , so we ' re gonna watch her from the monitors .
and i ' m gonna check it and visit him twice a day .
i won ' t leave you till she ' s well .
i ' m afraid that ' s completely against hospital rules . . .
how long can you take this ?
i don ' t know .
i ' m going one day .
i ' m sitting .
i ' m talking to him .
i come and talk to the other people .
if i sit there and talk , he won ' t die .
what are you gonna do if he dies ?
annie , i never . . .
you ' re the only one who can ' t accept this , john .
why don ' t you let her go ?
i can ' t explain this to you .
maybe i should be there when he comes to the end .
i don ' t know .
to prove he ' s still here .
to prove that i ' m his son .
so what did you do positive now ?
annie , this guy went to work every day in his life that he never liked .
we never asked him .
he did it because he was his father and he had no choice .
he never asked himself if i was happy .
he never knew if he had any right .
when that choice is old , we have to look after him and take care of him .
but i made it upside down .
john .
i ' m embarrassed against him , but my mother told him to rule .
she ' s old now .
i ' m embarrassed because i have a marriage that went bad because i have an unmanned job , and i have a son who ' s hard to recognize .
maybe this will be too hard for me ,
but when you die , i ' ll be there for you .
and i ' m gonna kiss him , and i ' m gonna cover him up ,
and i ' m gonna draw the gold you were there .
i owe him that .
when did you come to town ?
never left .
i ' m staying with some friends .
i didn ' t want to leave grandpa .
you came here every day ?
when you leave , a nurse calls me .
i ' ve been standing around half an hour .
where am i , johnny ?
you ' re in the hospital , dad .
i understand that .
why are you here ?
or was there an accident in an an accident ?
talk ?
yes , he does .
he learns like a child .
go , let dr chad report this .
please , please .
why did she look at me like that ?
ah-o is one of the hospital , dad .
that ' s a nurse .
molly , this is cecey , so , this is annie .
this is my father .
well , mr . tremont .
how can we make you comfortable ?
you can start with these pipes with me .
then i ' d better eat something .
are you going to starve me here ?
okay , we need to take it slow first .
remember you haven ' t eaten in a long time .
maybe that ' s why i ' m here .
have you thought about that ?
all tests positive , life signs static .
which is a healthy human profile .
i ' ve seen people coming out of a coma before .
we don ' t usually know why .
i have some theory about this .
i can ' t say that for now .
like what ?
somehow we gave him the last chance we gave him that his brain didn ' t build , and we ' re lucky about it .
i understand .
you know , when we came home we all said that was it .
but in return , your love and interest in your love and interest that made your father go away .
i think that ' s better .
me too .
they ' re here .
what ' s going on , dad ?
what are you looking for ?
your mother and i are starting a new life together , johnny .
we need new clothes .
i don ' t know , dad .
what do you think my mother would call these ?
she ' ll probably laugh at me and call me crazy , but she ' ll laugh at the end .
you ' ve been fucking laughing at home .
how about that ?
thanks .
thanks , thanks .
ladies and ladies , our show is starting .
no matter how much you ' re drunk during your performance , please stay out of your place .
our messing show ' s number one star ' s number one to present the number one star of our show ' s number one star ' s number has come from a nearly talented and almost certainly talented man , who ' s almost at his funeral and almost a successful tour of the man , he ' s back
great , jake .
i ' m asking her a big round of applause .
come on , big applause .
keep moving .
and her and mate , billy !
ladies and gentlemen , billy !
this is my dress i ' m gonna wear on a bike on the beach on the beach on the beach in berlin .
maybe when you skate .
this is the dress i ' m wearing while watching baseball .
look ?
i think i ' m gonna wear this more home .
honestly , i can go see some game , but not these clothes .
that ' s good to hear , jake .
wait .
there ' s another one .
do it again .
oh , i peed on my pants !
stop them !
i ' m dying !
i didn ' t hear anybody die laughing , bette .
but wouldn ' t that be good ?
i ' m telling you , johnny , he ' s not the same .
maybe their hormones are involved with someone else .
you know what happens in the hospital .
nobody ' s gonna believe he ' s 00 and he ' s about to die a few weeks ago .
you have to talk to someone , i mean it .
mom , she ' s just having fun .
we played only one hole golf , but still . . .
perfect day .
why don ' t you take us somewhere after breakfast ?
that ' s a good idea .
maybe mom ' ll come with us .
i ' m not getting in the car he drive .
it would have gone too fast before .
i hate thinking about what she loves right now .
don ' t worry about your pretty little head , bette .
you ' ll be safe in your bed while jake tremmont is at the wheel , while you ' re at the wheel .
and this is gonna be fun .
what are you looking for ?
nothing .
i still want to see if i can get a pushup .
i call it "the old man ' s pushup" .
what are you gonna do , bette ?
are you coming to the beach ?
i ' m coming , but only with a cab .
i don ' t want to go with a cab .
i think we sail in santa monica .
it ' s old people ' s heaven .
every corner or a office or a bank .
i want to drive to berlin .
oh , i used to love fishing .
where are my team ?
i think i put them in the garage somewhere .
00 years ago .
i ' ll go get them .
he ' ll be fine .
johnny , i ' m scared .
he ' s either talking about people i don ' t know . . . or people i ' m sure he ' s dead .
she says we live in a farm in a farm in new jersey maye may , and she ' s gonna take us there now because she has time for damage .
what ?
dad .
he told you , huh ?
what ' s going on ?
why don ' t you drive me around ?
john , i need to talk .
johnny , johnny , johnny , johnny , johnny
 . . .and in new jersey cape may , me , your mother and four kids , what are my odds of living on a small farm ?
i don ' t think you got any luck , dad .
isn ' t there any chance that there ' s a red farm ?
don ' t i have four kids there ?
you , annie , hank and little lizh ?
as i know , dad , you ' ve been living in los angeles for 00 years .
you had a regular job until you retired from locheed .
first we lived in the beachfield and you worked there for locheed .
i know you ' re right .
i say , how can you be in two places at the same time ?
i mean , i mean , my life here in the same way as here ,
i just sit and watch the ocean .
if it ' s very technically or very fantastic , you stop me .
your father , as laing ' s recipe , " a different schizophrenic" .
over the years , he ' s beginning to not enjoy the rest of his diary life , and he ' s reassuring something he ' s enjoying .
she ' s made more of a living than she ' s desired .
how long has this been going on ?
it ' s hard to tell now .
at least 00 years , maybe more .
unbelievable .
you understand , you have to have an extremely smart , three-sensitive , sentimental character to do this .
and what ' s my mother ' s place in all this ?
he was thrown out of these ?
you guys are frozen too .
your mother is very helpful , very sweet .
isn ' t that the most important thing in the world already ?
he has influence .
the problem is , your father ' s place in this world depends on your mother ' s confirmation .
he ' s been a happy man since he ' s been defeat himself .
the walls that saved two worlds were broken .
and he ' s brought the fun he ' s kept from his life for years .
if your mother doesn ' t join him , she ' ll be happy to go away .
hello , all the good people here .
maybe i ' ll make some jogging on the bike road .
what do people think if they see you like this ?
who cares ?
i don ' t want people calling us old buns .
and don ' t care what people think anymore .
ignore what a few young people are wearing .
i ' m coming with you , dad .
good boy , good boy .
don ' t worry about me .
i ' m gonna go to newark and pick up a few things for the farm .
hey , mom , mom , i told you what the doctor said .
you need to help him now .
your comments won ' t solve anything .
he lives in another time language .
he needs to show it .
that ' s all .
i told you , it ' s just a dream .
a great and wonderful dream world .
dad knows how to separate worlds now .
it ' s called .
i don ' t care what you say .
something happened to her .
this man is not your father .
i think this is the real jake tremont .
this guy ' s been hiding it for 00 years .
hi .
i ' m jake tremont , and this is bette tremont .
your neighbors across the road .
of course .
how can i help you ?
okay .
this is graham .
how you doing , young man ?
and say hello to mr . tremont , chris .
hi .
hi .
if you look for someone to take care of a child , we ' re all home .
oh , you ' re very kind .
thanks .
no , no , no , it ' s a dog that sleeps .
that ' s him .
it ' s a dog that sleeps like that .
yeah .
yeah , he ' s . . . so fast .
come . . .
perhaps we--
we wanted to say hello .
we brought you some cake .
come in .
maybe he ' s out there screwing the secret .
did you hear any weird noises last night ?
why , did you hear ?
i think i heard something .
i think it must be wind .
shut the door shut the door shut the door""
they ' ll come back with sugar ."
how ' s it going with dad ?
he thinks he ' s in a doctor position .
he ' s trying to get into my bed at night .
he won ' t leave me alone .
your father was always a sexy man , but he ' s been crazy ever since he got back from new jersey .
when we were first married , i told my friend fanny hogan about what we did with your father , and he told me to leave him and let him know .
when i confessed with the priest , he said he would pray for me .
but it didn ' t work .
you know , when your father is warned , the cops , the priests , the priests , the prayers , nothing can stop him .
oh , grow up .
"i ' m small , short , short , fat cup of tea"
" here ' s my pervert , my mouth in my mouth ."
" when you get out of this house"
"you can hear my peace"
"bend me and spray me !"
oh , bingo .
there .
you know , i realized something .
we don ' t speak japanese .
you just realized that ?
we have to try a new country one night a week .
we just need to eat the food of that country and speak the language of it .
we have to do this .
no , we shouldn ' t .
"where ' s the station station ?" "where ' s the
"where ' s the station station ?" "where ' s the
what are you doing ?
i ' m trying to find the train station .
i think that ' s a good idea .
it ' s working .
i feel like japanese .
oh , yes , annie , give us some samples , please .
clothes , huh ?
" the clothes of the japanese women ' s . . .
"it ' s different from the people .
"in the city , the villagers of the countrymen like their husbands . . .
" . . .pants and trainotons .
" this is someone who just got here ,
" . . .it ' s terrible for the people to separate their sexes ." ."
i don ' t know about you , but i don ' t want to be in a country where i can ' t separate people from sex .
seriously .
this has happened to me in a bar before .
john , tell us what ' s going on .
" in the country of these mountains , only 00% of the computer ' s computer can be committed ."
hand me the rice , please .
if you say that japanese .
" could you hand me the van , please ."
you ' re welcome .
come on , mom .
you too .
no .
no .
no .
billy , go ahead .
traditional japanese sports .
what have you prepared for us ?
"sumo wrestler , put on the sumo suit . . .
" . . . they have to reach 000 pound weight before they repent ."
that ' s a big idea .
give him as fat as you can fatten him , and then stick him in a diaper .
john , don ' t you think these guys are interesting ?
mario , i ' m starting to worry about you .
honey , please tell me . . .
wait a minute .
hand , hand . . .
what do you want ?
how ' s the fish ?
you want her too ?
here .
no , i don ' t , jake .
i don ' t eat this .
i don ' t want to know japanese .
i don ' t want to know the neighbors '  children .
mom , please stop . . .
i wanted to walk but now i know what i have .
but since he came back from the hospital , this place has become a madhouse .
costumes , jogging , hours of sex .
and a farm in new jersey-da-da-indan !
i tell you , this man can ' t even leave the street alone .
dad ' s really good .
he just wants to have fun !
i didn ' t live my life to end this way !
a crazy man at my age !
you know that better .
the doctor said he ' s not crazy !
the truth is , he ' s been under your pressure for 00 years !
oh , come on .
please don ' t .
don ' t say such things to your mother .
please .
we ' re family .
trust each other .
love each other and let ' s forget each other .
and please don ' t fight .
it kills me to talk like that .
why ?
why are you doing this ?
you ' re going to make him back .
it can ' t be what you want .
i want my husband back .
he wants his life back .
she loved you for 00 years .
can ' t you just leave him alone ?
i ' m scared , jake .
i don ' t understand who you are .
i don ' t know you .
i know .
look at me or . . . and see the old man they see and see .
but inside me , thank god , bette , i feel 00 .
and i ' m pretending , i guess .
your other life , jake , is giving .
what ' s so bad about me ?
we ' re a little late .
a little .
are you asking me to come back to our old life ?
oh , no .
i ' m asking you to come back to life we want .
you were so good .
not just me , to the world . . .
we used to have a good time , remember ?
we used to always dance .
you were a pretty good dancer .
and i ' d like to dance with you one last time before i die .
don ' t talk about death .
dying isn ' t a sin .
life too .
morning , mom .
morning .
nice dress .
your father likes it .
mr . tremont ?
i have some news .
not very good .
what is it ?
well , this doesn ' t seem the same in every case , but , well . . .
okay , good doctor , you can tell me the truth .
cancer ' s back .
spread .
it ' s infected the lymph rags .
how much ?
that ' s hard to say .
every patient looks different .
dr chad ?
i don ' t know .
hey , dad , what are you doing at this hour ?
i ' m waiting for you .
why ?
now you and your mother and i were divorced too small to come home late .
as a father , i think i lost my sense of concern for my son .
you want me to come out and come back ?
no , just sit down and talk .
what do you want to talk about ?
i ' m gonna try to tell you something .
as your father , i want to give some advice .
some predators .
i can ' t think of anything .
it might be hard for someone your age to understand someone my age .
you know , every time we see each other , we ' re always on the move .
i ' ll come with you , or we ' ll be at someone ' s wedding .
all we ' re talking about is the waltz , the bags or the little sandwiches we can eat .
i don ' t know much about you .
well , well , look , i ' m 0:00 ,
i like sports , i like bike--
you know , we always do the same thing .
we ' ll come to your side ,  . . .one of us will joke after telling a real thing .
talk to me .
tell me about mexico .
i love it there .
ah , there ' s people there who understand sincerity and understanding .
well ,  . . .that ' s where life goes in a ritual .
do you have many friends there ?
yes , there are five of us .
you know , we hang out as a group .
we work together .
we share everything we do .
we share the cleaning house .
we ' re a real family .
other men from school ?
well , two of them are girls .
life has changed , billy .
it ' s hard to believe that life has changed .
why is money coming from your mother and me ?
oh .
you said you wanted to talk .
okay .
because , uh , this is about what a man was before .
some dad dresses and make good money .
okay , that ' s easy .
because i love this power .
it ' s nice to be the one who ' s good , everybody ' s running for it .
and something had to be given , and this was my family .
well , i never did .
i never got away from my family .
running was the hardest thing that ever happened to me .
that ' s not what it looked like .
i mean , because we wanted to be normal .
that ' s what it says in the books .
don ' t get divorced .
but it hurt .
a little .
it still hurts .
i miss you , billy .
and you never needed me around you .
but i love staying in your life .
i ' m your father .
i got you something .
someone i owe something to someone .
so what is it ?
forgiveness .
a little sleepy .
were you here all afternoon ?
it feels better when i ' m here .
let ' s go down and get something to eat .
the doctor will be here soon .
i don ' t want to miss her .
i ' ll catch up with you .
come on .
where ' s mom ?
billy and something went down for dinner .
oh , good .
how are you feeling ?
perfect .
i can say good .
you know what i think ?
what ?
0000 yankees games .
what ?
i ' m trying , but all i can think of is old games and old knees .
bonanza .
oh , that ' s great , dad .
what about the 0000 yankees-dodgers games ?
who took it ?
this is the biggest thing in baseball history .
the players yankee middle fake , joe dimagogi , game prince , prince stenars , stoders , stodgers , and dodgers , dodger , dodgers , left wings , left wing
alionfriddo , second rower .
just that left winger . . .
carl furillo played because he was hurt .
you know this story ?
tell me .
well , in the sixth game , six dodgers were right in front of the time of the hit show .
two , two out .
topagio .
he threw the left ball in the middle of the wing , made the most famous run in history .
everyone there knew that .
but that little man gionfriddo came out .
he ran after the ball .
but he couldn ' t cut the ball as joe dimagio ' s hit .
at the last moment , it shattered .
he lived forever .
but the big thing came .
dimagio started his second tour run , and he saw gionfriddo grabbed the ball .
she ' s so depressing , she kicked the laundry .
you like this ?
this man who never understood his feelings , he was a human being .
al gionfriddo was the one who found his feelings .
you know what that means to me ?
what is it ?
in america , anything is possible if you do your job well .
sometimes i ' d love to take care of you more when you were a kid .
i ' d love to kiss you more .
you did this , father , you did .
do you know how much i love you ?
yeah .
so much , johnny .
good , sometimes bad .
honey , i ' m putting these in the car .
okay .
did you talk to mom ?
my mom ' s gonna stay here for now .
until next month .
we ' ll see about that later .
okay .
i think she ' ll be fine .
how are you holding up ?
i miss him .
yeah , me too .
go ahead , i ' ll catch you up .
one moment , please .
you go .
hmm . . .
grandpa , we just wanted to say goodbye to you before the fuse .
well . . . and we decided this is the right place to do this .
because there ' s so much of you here .
you have something growing and growing .
when i thought about you . . .
that was fun .
yeah .
grandpa , i love you and i ' ll always miss you .
my father and i are here together .
that ' s good .
that ' s a good idea .
i feel better .
me too .
and they say that the perpetrating progress and the black garbage that invites demons .
he looked at me like he was trying to get me to clear a mystery .
he ' s come to the guitara .
but it ' s not gonna be the same quality ceremony as the fact that i realized that this year is going to be over political events .
we ' re gonna pay half of the traditional rules now and half when it ' s done .
tell me , nothing else you ' re scared of ?
please don ' t help them so quickly .
but honestly , i ' ve designed a series of more unimaginable tools i know you ' re gonna be interested in your high mind .
speaking of mine , zitto ' s farm had a two-headed ice cream .
the last time i came up with the knife you brought , it was rotting .
a card can show not only one man ' s nature , but its fate .
it represent the sacrifice .
i must introduce myself as a military engineer , not a artist .
why don ' t night guards make that man comfortable ?
the man ' s sword was so loose and now he finds himself looking at this beautiful sword .
because if you ask people , they say i can use both my hands very well and very well , very comfortable with both my hands , and i can fight very well both my hand , both my hand and my two hand . . .
you ' ve made a very serious mistake this evening , artifact .
but i ' m staying at the guest house of the black swan .
come and see me before i go .
what did he give you ?
same ass , very different faces , and i got a sip from the boob when i realized that .
i ' m not gonna let you screw up our family ' s last name with your flying moves and what you ' re doing to bargain yourself in order to bargain .
as much as i want to deny you , our reputation depends on each other .
my wife , margherita gave me a boy last week .
i ' m legal .
i wonder how long it ' s gonna take him to curse his last name .
you ' re a good man .
by men who know how to shoot .
this is what you did , leonardo .
they ' re killing a jew today .
she ' s definitely an attractive woman , but i ' d rather go to bed without teeth over there .
please give me something to drink from the memory fountain .
depends on what ' s inside .
history is a swordsman who ' s been brought in gun by people who suppose the truth of history .
years later , your story will be repressed .
did you hear a word , "the life is like a river" ?
the most unacceptable thing in this word is the river ' s circulation .
one ' s death opens the other ' s birth door .
i saw a man who ' s been executioned today .
please give me something to drink from the memory fountain .
this temple treasury was a temple that was used for a religious conviction long before jesus .
we are known as the sons of mithra .
it ' s a reminder that a lot of you once said that the process was remembered .
lately , some clues showed me some things where they ' re gonna place the book .
when the avamraf was caught and sent to death , he was following those clues .
maybe you heard of the secret records vatatican ' s gathering .
he ' s a man named lupo merci .
i still don ' t understand what this has to do with me .
he was against his will from constantine .
remember when you were a kid , something happened .
i was a kid in the second time .
i was sent to get the lost lamb and get it .
what am i gonna do until then ?
fate chose you , leonardo .
i don ' t believe in fate .
then believe in yourself .
and where am i gonna start looking ?
with the hanged man , from the deep of the soul .
she already opened the door for you .
what about mom ?
the other side will be waiting for you .
all you have to do is walk through the door .
master !
we ' ve been looking for you since last night .
this place has been empty for years , leo .
master , the guardians were looking for you .
they said lienzo medicist himself wanted you .
leonardo di ser piero . . .
they said my cluster had a son of a bastard .
and the problem was that you ' re a disgraceful , arrogant , arrogant , inconvenient , self-esteem .
arrogance means i exaggerate my own value .
my mistress , lucrezia seems to think you have enough in me that i don ' t have in my poker .
he insisted that only you could picture his beauty .
he must be pretty careful then .
a character flaw could be called .
you have to be smart enough to finish this .
it ' s the last thing i ' m afraid of being bored when it comes to mrs . donati .
then i ' ll tell your father you ' ll have a contract ready .
i have some designs i think you might interest .
this is gonna increase your gunshot ' s firestorms .
when the top of the fever ' s been shot down , the parts of it will be filled with balls , and the bottom of it will get cold .
and the balls are on a air-- some kind of air--
there ' ll be two men in power .
they ' re gonna control the manivel so they can turn the tires .
the balls can be planted around the vehicle .
it ' s a flight machine .
modeled from a bat ' s joints wing .
they were born with wings , yeah .
i believe people can fly , and i assume god has blessed us with the brains that can imagine .
anything that can be imagined can finally be done .
who said otherwise is an idiot .
what exactly do you suggest ?
i hope to hire an army engineer .
i ' m a documentsman , da second .
i had nothing to do with getting war .
rome too .
both the government and the other government have made an ally .
sforza ' s death was the end of the play board .
you need your own weapons , sir .
i ' ll give you an amazing salary .
to see what ' s happening and what ' s happening is really possible .
shall we say 000 florin then ?
more bargain and i ' ll cut your tongue off .
as you say , sir .
thank you .
you used lucrezia to get to me , didn ' t you ?
i ' ll do anything i can to get my targets .
brilliant but i suggest you not be too smart around me .
something wrong ?
no , sir .
florans don ' t have secrets .
what demon did you do this time ?
she played with a woman ' s pride .
then back to work .
we have a colombina to do !
i want you to remove the body of the jew .
i need a restraining .
is that my use ?
your body depends on refreshing .
well , let me get to work .
his family ' s coming .
she ' s with francesco and old jackopo .
the way we do .
they ' ve been sent to our ancestor for what they did in the first race .
colombina ' s about to fly .
all of you , welcome to the house of god .
the flames of the motherfuckers are so close to you .
tell me the truth , are you always so desperate for who you sleep with ?
you ' re not a whore , ma ' am .
there ' s no way we can go on this game any longer , mrs . donati .
i knew you were the first time you came to me .
how did you know ?
i drew you .
your faces , your trial , your move .
more attractive question is why a noble woman would jeopardize her reputation for a burglary artifact .
isn ' t that what the festival ' s all about ?
tell me what then .
you knew i ' d call you .
lorenzo really liked your design .
can i see some of your miracles ?
what is this ?
a device to slow down someone ' s fall rate .
and under which circumstances am i supposed to use this ?
let ' s say you ' re trapped in a castle .
you can relieve it and be safe in the air .
thank god .
lienzo is obviously right about what he showed you .
you risked more .
maybe your life .
what do you have on my reckless attitude ?
i ' m forbidden meyer and think your fate has been scratched too .
you ' re the third person this week to tell me something about fate .
maybe you just started hearing things .
now . . .
fuck me again , leonardo .
this time , remember , you ' re not the only one who can manipulate manipulation .
we can ' t let you through the front door for certain reasons .
i ' m rude .
i promised to pay first .
i accept you satisfied ?
well , tell me then .
a new player on the stage .
leonardo da second is an artifact .
the civilians hired him to make the field weapons .
the arts are the clowns of families .
i don ' t understand why this news is interesting us .
this art is different .
my spy in floransa .
if i ' m not mistaken , you ' re lupo merciari .
the head of the secret .
looks like a new champion found himself a new champion .
keep watching him .
see if he ' s cooperating .
what if he doesn ' t ?
then he ' ll burn in hell with pain .
with the other enemies of god .
don ' t make it hard .
yeah , you too .
in a good defense , you have to be on the line of offense .
when the bad guy comes on you , you get to the line and create a new line .
until he ' s old and old and dead , or are you going to save me ?
angel , i didn ' t ask you to drill holes in me .
i want to learn to fight .
you don ' t believe i ' m gonna do this .
men aren ' t always around to protect women .
besides , what if you were the man i should fight ?
could be .
okay .
force him to stand up to his own speed .
cordelia , using a deadly weapon is a little different than waving a pon .
ready !
ok !
you ' re on the team .
lilah .
i was friends with billy .
thanks a lot , gavin .
i ' ll take it from here .
she felt trapped .
gavin , why don ' t you go and make a deal ?
you don ' t want to wake up in such a terrible place again , do you ?
nobody wants that .
congressman .
i hope you ' re staying out of trouble this time .
let ' s go home .
this is the second time you brought our nephew back to us .
our pleasure .
"it ' s a pleasure" means he has nothing to do with it .
good boy .
go away .
why don ' t you just open your big mouth and try to listen to it for once ?
you weren ' t captain of the argument team , were you ?
at least lindsey . . .
your attempt to train angel ' s you are responsible .
i ' m proud of you .
being ready never hurts .
if you think you can help you in the fight , why not ?
i was kidding .
wesley , if you want to get to know fred better soon , maybe next time you have a chance to imply that you don ' t want us to come over for dinner .
so i . . .
that obvious ?
i don ' t think the others noticed .
but the last thing any one of us has to do is be with each other .
office love , even under the most normal circumstances . . .
we don ' t live under normal circumstances .
what are the odds we have to find someone out who can deal with what we have to deal with ?
i don ' t know , maybe we should think . . .
with each other ?
i was gonna say being alone .
wesley , if you like her , tell her .
this murder was committed a week ago .
why are they showing this to me now ?
how did you get these ?
he sold you these ?
usually if the victim ' s important , they sell these .
she said she didn ' t listen to her .
he was trying to keep her quiet .
it worked .
look who was there 00 minutes before the crime took place .
what ?
okay , nice one .
and who is it ?
you sure it was him ?
when you get one of one of the size of hell , you remember her face .
yeah , that ' s him .
now we know why the power ' s woman showed me her death .
she died because of me .
angel , if he ' s responsible for this , then so am i .
angel . . .
hey .
whatever ' s happening right now , you ' re not responsible , and i ' m not .
but i know who you are .
you ' re a bit angry , lilah .
it was a long day in the office .
i ' m careful .
i was gonna do this .
i know , i know some of his powers don ' t do this . . .
billy certainly didn ' t touch me , and you can ' t touch him .
this family is the most important family in the country .
they have half the east coast .
the law won ' t do anything to them .
some monsters aren ' t the kind of thing to be right .
stay away from my client .
i don ' t think ringing the bell is gonna be too good .
what do you say we sneak in , dress up like securityers ?
well , you want to be next ?
i think we should wait here .
why didn ' t it surprise me to get in without being invited ?
as far as i know , you have my invitation .
i never hurt a woman in my life .
i just like watching .
you ' re coming back .
really ?
you ' re looking for me .
we ' re taking you into custody for questioning .
sanchez , read him his rights .
who are you ?
nobody .
i ' ll tell you what i ' m worried about , there ' s a woman who never listens to me .
yeah , giving up $00 million in a fortune and running into a prison cell .
yeah , but for how long ?
if there ' s nothing in an unpredictable ignorant hell fever in a very good demon dimension , it wouldn ' t be a simple problem for me if there was nothing wrong with him .
angel , what are you gonna do ?
you can ' t just walk into a police station and play the terrorist .
there was an accident .
he could tell what billy did to her partner before he attacked her .
it ' s not a bad idea for one of us to wait for a patient to visit his family in hospital .
that ' s part of the blood in the car .
not human .
he came here .
i ' ll get an example of a hotel , see what kind of creature billy is .
i ' ll take care of a toe .
normal diary work .
cordelia .
i don ' t think you should do this .
how can i not ?
i managed to get billy ' s blood sample .
we may be able to locate the demon robbery and see how his power works .
can you hand me the windows ?
thank you .
are you going to invite me in ?
please , come in .
i want you to tell me about billy .
tell angel everything you don ' t tell her .
what makes you think i ' m gonna do that ?
your face first .
i ' ll know right away from being reopened .
i don ' t change sides in trouble .
angel feels responsible for this boy because he brought him back from hell .
i feel responsible because he did it to save me .
actually , you ' re totally responsible for this because you ' re a dirty bitch .
he ' s got his heel .
pink , this spring is not fashion .
billy blim ' s driving people crazy .
then why didn ' t he impress angel ?
others can take hours .
god , i hope angel doesn ' t start to feel angry .
you really haven ' t .
i have to find billy .
and i ' ll help you , why ?
do you remember the man you hired to break into my visions ?
you know what he did to me ?
i ' m cut , i ' ve been smashed , my face broke , i ' ve been hurt every second , or it ' s gonna get worse before i die .
this is obvious .
certainly not something you can do to stop this .
to be destroyed by someone else for the moment of your life .
and a woman strong enough , she ' d never put on a "naked bitch" cover .
where ' s billy ?
i ' m a 00-year taxi , i understand why you ' re doing this .
there ' s a reason , am i right ?
how many times do you want to talk to your client ?
surprised you ?
probably sitting back there , telling him how to drive the car .
you know these kinds .
probably deserved it .
like i said . . .
dylan , your cousin ' s here .
hi , dylan .
billy .
i didn ' t know you had a party .
i thought we agreed you wouldn ' t be here anymore after the last thing .
do you want me or do you ?
some of the white boys seem to be very strong .
that probably shows billy ' s demon last name .
so billy ' s people are crazy , it seems to be in his blood .
which means it could or spit it out or even touch it .
speaking of spit , where ' s cordelia ?
i guess when you said he went out , you knew he was out because you talked to him .
well . . . i thought i was . . .
if you lie to me again , there ' s gonna be something serious between us .
sit down , fred .
there ' s something we need to talk about .
i ' m sorry i didn ' t tell you cordelia was gone .
we still have to make some changes around here .
could be a change , i guess .
it ' s like you don ' t wear a provocative dress anymore .
provocative ?
maybe your parents never told you what men and their grown men were going after .
you can ' t keep coming here and punishing me in my face .
you ' re forcing me to take him for real .
is that what you want ?
stop it .
are we standing now ?
you put your hair back together , you snap your eyes , and then you turn our backs and laugh at us .
do you think you can do anything you want because you ' re connected to life , because somewhere is bleeding ?
no .
i ' ll show you the blood .
what do you say to a woman with two purple eyes ?
nothing you ' ve already said twice .
no sense of humor .
to be honest , i ' m calling to kill that cast .
come in .
you need to know the rules about billy .
everyone in the family knows these rules .
don ' t leave your girlfriend alone , keep your pet and never let him touch you .
when you want money , leave it on the table and get away .
can you explain something to me ?
why did you invite me in after you said i wanted to kill your cousin ?
you ' re angel , right ?
billy mentioned me ?
he said an overly emotional man named angel would come here later .
the melod hero ' s exaggerated . . .
fred .
i know what you did .
who you are .
you ' re pulling me out .
you ' re forcing me to find you .
it ' s like a cat-fare game .
you ' re fooling me with the ways of girls .
but you never give up , right ?
no , you keep laughing and running .
i ' m guessing i ' m not one of the new finish students .
i ' m a man .
you can ' t show up , can you ?
no , you hide .
you cheat .
and you , snake , set a conspiracy behind our backs .
" honey , eat this .
it ' s just an apple ." just an apple ."
the problem is your sex .
why are you making me do this ?
do i know you ?
i thought we should meet .
i ' m the woman wolfram and lyric tortured to get you out of your cell next cell .
i understand .
poor , desperate , crushed woman needs to shoot all the wrongs out of her .
no , asshole .
i ' m here to send you back .
i mean , of course , you women are who sell themselves for money and price , but men are just as bad as that .
maybe even worse .
their career , their family , even their lives , for what ' s under the skirt .
i ' m wearing pants .
actually , it ' s because i ' ve got a reading that i ' ve been getting engaged to the almarida .
and is it a coincidence that i use a penis form of gun ?
i don ' t think so .
you don ' t have the guts to do that .
you were wrong again .
he can ' t hurt me .
no , i won ' t hurt her .
i won ' t hurt him at all .
here .
i ' d say billy ' s blood was on his hand .
you mean the blood of billy ' s handprint off the fingerprints device downstairs ?
you ' re telling me you took my hand and came back to a wes crazy killer because of the sign i looked at ?
that ' s what worries me when you explain this .
i better get out of here .
lock the door behind me .
maybe we should do plan b .
god .
you said we should give plan b , but what ' s the plan b ?
plan b . . .
plan b . . .
the plan , if you don ' t stop crying , i ' m gonna punch you . . .
god .
cordy , get out of here .
all that rage , all that rage , that rage , all the hate .
please go .
i can ' t .
that ' s my problem .
you think that ' s your problem ?
you know what your real problem is ?
men like this !
because your power doesn ' t affect me .
charles , you ' re scaring me .
take this and put me down .
you want me to hit you ?
yes !
i can ' t .
you can .
hit me !
charles , please .
"chles , please ." good .
you ' ll pay for this .
would you like to hear my theory , fred ?
about how stupid you are .
i believe that after five years living in a cave , i believe that if you ' re out of trust to be safe , you ' re gonna hide in small , dark place .
let ' s get this over with .
i ' m sorry , wesley .
are you sorry ?
you were right about me loving the dark places to hide .
but you forgot that i also liked to make things work .
i don ' t understand either .
i mean , you ' re a man , but why didn ' t billy ' s touch affect you ?
maybe because i ' m not human .
and a vampire never turns into a monster .
you know what billy ' s made of other people ?
it was always for pain and pleasure .
i think you could say the devil ' s side makes you less important than people .
like a noble one .
i mean , it ' s really uncomfortable being in bad shape .
weird .
what is it ?
i ' m getting used to fighting outside and i ' m relieved at the same time .
i understand that .
wesley , it ' s me , fred .
does it hurt ?
i left you a lot of messages .
i ' m so sorry .
wesley , you gotta get back to work .
how could you not ?
but it ' s time to go back .
fred .
something inside me was forced to surface .
god , no .
it was nothing inside , wesley .
he was something to you .
i don ' t know what kind of man i am anymore .
i know .
you ' re a good man .
will i see you back at the office ?
yeah .
good .
why would he risk everything to get away from the tender arms ?
tomorrow we ' re walking to rome with crixus .
but i want you to go with spartacus .
do we eat a rabbit ?
get your torch here !
his orders are known for drowning .
and stalin .
gennaus pumppeius magnus '  groom .
i thought pumpy was hit with the traitor hardorius in the sinkhole .
if pumpy ' s scanners return to republic , he and his legions will leave their trail .
let me know if you see any moves on the side .
then we must support the ghost and see the skirt daylights .
did he always end up as he fell ?
the day after we broke our ways was full of victory .
the blood of our enemy ' s blood was loaded with the dead , turning our heads to the ground .
did he have the same fate as cxus ?
to show spartacus the end he ' ll live on .
crassus pushes your mind and makes you stupid .
if i only had my own trouble , maybe i ' d fall into your trap .
he was heading south towards crassus '  legions .
order to leave the camp at the speed of apo ' s sky .
a whore named canhara got beaten and stabbed to death .
this offer has put me in a hell of a lot .
i don ' t know that pumpy ' s back on a case that ' s not gonna make it up to himself .
if there was such a desire , why didn ' t he just thank himself ?
i wouldn ' t risk going to your commander ' s camp .
and i ' m not gonna stand in my way to say hello in front of a haunted treason .
you can ' t really think about accepting this offer .
pumpy wants to know what you know about spartacus to steal the victory from the one who deserves it .
and when the time comes , we can get revenge for those who have to walk half the heart .
let ' s get in touch with the hot skin that still lives .
and to console them for the right left .
each blood of the roman blood shall be planted in the honour of us !
right now i have professor charles epipes , often consulting for the fbi , a mathist with the calsic .
are you here to help the fbi find bonnie parks ?
for example , we know miss parks '  car was found in san marino avm .
yes , i ' ve paid 00 and 00 people to come after you for revenge .
that ' s right , but every suspect was completely honest .
you either have a circus game or you squeeze water gun in the clown ' s mouth .
the asetric threat should consider every suspicious suspect who feeds an impulse on every suspect , just like every clown in the mouth of a clown .
we need to find the situation where the suspect feeds enough to detonate the point where he ' s gonna blow it up .
especially those who ' re afraid of him , who he ' s scared of .
filter pump has been making a lot of noise lately .
hello , charlie .
your father told me the after class the other day , and i ' m willing to go .
get out in the long run , do your planet a favor .
it ' s a full shut box during their research .
he worked on his own until the check .
i was in the same bedroom in afghanistan .
he doesn ' t trust his security .
i ' ll go by myself .
the crew found the notes we found in the woman ' s office .
your wife , ex , your ex , your rage boyfriend .
i ' ll be on my way right now .
charlie , who could have tried to do this to you ?
because you were really upset about my interview .
nothing should change anything .
it was december .
can we see this in the room ?
helal .
and you made a sacrifice to make her do something big to her , you know .
i started this job in my 00th .
it ' s like a big hero in the bruising center to the bruising center , making taylor look like a big hero .
it ' s hard to get out of their houses , and taylor ' s wife is usually talking to the poor people that she scared of .
i ' m still working on it .
that ' s the problem i need to know what i ' m accusing your problem analysis of and what i ' m not doing .
i told your father i ' d make a shot .
so , how cute is it to see the power count back ?
right ?
i don ' t know how long it ' s gonna last .
now that you ' re back , either you ' re brave or your brain is small .
i have sonny layva .
when i find bonnie , he ' ll mark sonny .
there ' s no way sonny kidnapped a guy alone .
when they handcuffed me on that freighter , when they handcuffed me , there was something that made me hang out with needles .
and he knew my team would come for me .
the worse things were , david , megan and don , you were working with megan and you were going to walk through that door .
because i did the same thing myself in afghanistan the first time i saw war .
yeah , they ' re tricks , tricks , mistresses , phone numbers , call numbers , all that hidden .
if you draw civilians , civilians , if you pull down , he ' ll pull them down , and he ' ll pull them down with a power to lure them down .
at the same time the neighbors would help lift the prank .
the fact that he was gonna sink the entire shamen line into water .
he ' d make millions by buying those property .
hundreds , probably .
we never know .
so does this .
it ' s nothing but a personal blood case .
it ' s not just about walls and roof rents .
it was also the same faith that the spirit and beauty of the spirit of that master ' s all the same .
right behind you .
i mean , do you think i ' m gonna give you a foot tie ?
you know , better .
what do you do exactly ?
nobody likes french .
we ' ve lost contact with our discovery troops .
but we know that it is the point where the disease is always analysising the oil analysis , which we know is where this micro oil starts .
we won ' t know until we see an example .
if there are survivors , there will be survivors , if there are survivors , and you ' ll find a blood sample directly from the dead , but the sea missiles will be destroyed at 00:00 hours before the entire area .
i don ' t need to tell you what ' s going to happen if the 00utes gets the story .
what ' s that smell ?
we did it .
the obstacles of the living dead have been disable .
mom !
megan .
you can ' t fly , baby .
mom !
mr . edick .
what are you doing here ?
we need to talk , janet .
can ' t we do another time ?
my daughter . . .
you ' re not answering my calls .
that ' s why i came to see you .
no flying .
how can you find me and not find my husband in the middle of san than sano ?
your husband doesn ' t want to be found .
i told you that .
yes , i said i ' d give you all i can give you .
that ' s not how things work , janet .
maybe that ' s because my husband paid you .

they missed a mother .
they didn ' t touch the kid .
a mother who left her child .
no , a single mother .
a good mother .
she was looking at the kids at home .
that sounds . . .
if this was gonna happen , it could ' ve been in san india .
i found an image .
of course you did .
i ' m not talking to my assumptions , kat .
cops don ' t ignore the evidence as they used to .
security cameras got everything .
the internet network can ' t take it for another couple hours .
unidentified .
unidentified .
something that ' s hopeless .
anybody ask your woman ?
her mother has her mother , but . . .
you ' re looking at me .
i ' m looking at you .
your mum ' s gonna have a dead body bag , mark .
you know that .
let me know first .
then you can look at the missing mother thing .
i can ' t see anything .
everyone think .
what was the last thing you remember ?
last night , i went to sleep like every night , and then i woke up here .
who could have done this ?
what ' s your value ?
worth ?
i ' m driving for a student in a difficult situation .
i make $00 ,000 a year .
i have $00 ,000 in pension .
you soldier ?
the military won ' t pay much , sir .
and you ?
i have no value to anyone but myself .
maybe , maybe not .
why do you think they kidnap you ?
i ' d rather not .
what do you do ?
no offense , but i don ' t know who you guys are .
we think where the bad guys sitting here are .
how do we know the bad guys aren ' t here ?
he ' s right .
one of us could be one of them .
but there ' s only one joe we don ' t know anything about .
everyone has value in their eyes .
i don ' t have any money , i don ' t have a family .
i have no value in anyone ' s eyes .
maybe it ' s life insurance .
no .
it ' s the only reason i know someone ' s kidnapping .
not everyone is abducted for money .
right , sergeant ?
are you saying someone ' s gonna cut our heads off ?
it ' s hard to do if we move .
come on , come on .
there you go .
somebody get that table over there .

so which one of you is in charge ?
aren ' t you in charge ?
you ' re not one of them , are you ?
so you ' re not one of them .
i don ' t even know who their lady is , okay ?

i won ' t stop squeezing without answers .
what ' s your name ?
how do we get out of here ?
i don ' t know .
red lights , anyway .
i woke up at that hotel up there .
odin .
i heard you crossed my room .
are you the one who asked for help ?
so you ' re saying you left him ?
look , no offense .
enough .
so what do we do with him ?
does it matter ?
could be one of them .
okay .
who ' s coming with me ?
me .
what else ?
we don ' t know what ' s out there .
so , what , we stay here ?
i ' m just saying we need to be cautious .
wait till dark .
then i ' ll take the rifle and find out .
what happens if you get caught in the darkness ?
i ' m taking the risk .
that ' s your thing , isn ' t it ?
but then you ' ll be dead with the only rifle we have .
if that ' s what you think . . .
i don ' t expect darkness .
i ' m going home right now .
you can stay here and watch the others .
who authorized that ?
you did .
if i ' m not back by tomorrow , you ' ll find out .
i ' ll get help .
no , no .
please don ' t go .
i have to .
are you in the military , joe ?
me ?
are you kidding ?
where did you get such an idea ?
what you said .
that ' s the kind of thing you know about that soldier .
what business is that ?
janet , your daughter ' s probably very good .
my daughter ' s 0 years old , okay ?
he ' s allergic and he ' s got a special bathtub to do .
well , if anything happens to you here . . .
okay , but if anything happens to you , you have family , right ?
so your life can ' t wait either .
who ' s waiting for you at home ?
exactly .
there ' s no one to wait .
joe ?
joe , can you hear me ?
what ?
wait a minute !
we can ' t leave them to die .
we don ' t leave anyone behind , but there ' s a way to do this , i ' m tired .
okay .
okay .
you think they got shot ?
nothing .
i don ' t see blood .
there should be a lot of blood .
i ' m coming too .
if i get shot , you ' re gonna have to find out where the shooting came from .
okay .
mcirna !
which obviously doesn ' t work .
we have to go back .
get inside !
get inside !
let ' s go inside .
do you remember the last time you saw your daughter ?
not recently .
we were both very busy .
he had a babysit babysitting business , so i . . .
honestly , i wasn ' t talking to my daughter .
actually , she wasn ' t talking to me .
she totally let me out of her life for a while .
i never even met her husband .
he thought megan should know his mother .
he never thought i was a good parents .
he said i was being mean .
but i never hit him .
once .
i hit him with a hairbrush until it broke .
my daughter and i . . .
the will of both of us is very strong .
i found this in your room .

now take your baby upstairs and play with him .
i need to talk to mr . renbe .

sofia , how can i help you ?
now i ' m working on a bargain with the phone in a big company .
sofia , how can i help you ?
i ' m too fat to get the bad guys fired so i ' m looking at dead men .
i ' ve been looking at a dwarf body in the casac , a expensive restaurant i ' ve always wanted to go one night .
stuck in his throat and drowned .
the waitress heimlich tried , but when the ring came out , it was too late .
there was a sign i couldn ' t read in the ring .
i was wondering . . . and i cleaned the ring by licking the ring .
without thinking .
in refs .
the problem is , i like it .
fresh oyster and the galaiis tasted wine .
i was wondering , what was the article ?
"i ' ll even love you in the barn ."

it ' s not just about saving ourselves .
or at least try to save others .
i ' ll go if i have to .
you don ' t trust alex ?

maybe that ' s why he doesn ' t wanna see me naked .
sofia , please . . .

i didn ' t try anything different , i didn ' t live , i didn ' t try .
i feel like i ' ve been missing my 00 years of my life .
i was fat because i wanted him to leave me .
leave me , leave me , leave me !
i ran out and my partner came to cheer me up .
suddenly i heard a sound and a man was fighting my partner .
i thought you robbed her .
it pushed him and ran away .
i tried to call for help , but obviously my heart couldn ' t stand .
did you see the man who robbed him ?
no .
it was too dark .
did your partner have any problems ?
no .
last question .
you ' re that kiloaway guy , right ?
use kiloaway !
use kiloaway !
use kiloaway !
use kiloaway !
weightay !
weightay !
weightay !
take care , please .
in the privacy of your houses , in front of the mirror .
if your answer is yes , forget what doctors and society says .
stop feeling bad .
forget my way , kiloaway pills .
let ' s move to 0 .
my name my name is my name my name
it ' s not important to lose weight , it ' s important how you feel .
identify yourself with a word .
light .
happy .
terrible .
let ' s see if your feelings are connected to your weight .
00 pounds light .
i beat the priest .
looks like sofia is the only one with feelings of lost weight .
why do you think you lost weight ?
i don ' t know , i ' ve been more active in the last few months .
i ' ve got a purpose and a motivation .
but i think it ' s actually more satisfying that i ' m actually more satisfactory .
more .
i made some cold water , it ' s good for your heart .
you can ' t believe that the neighbors used a copy for rampa .
we must support each other in this life .
i put your clothes in the closet .
i ' m tired of seeing them all nonsense around them .
disaster !
right away .
what is this ?
i checked all the exams myself .
i can ' t believe it either .
what ?
shit , big ass !
i ' ve only been less than you !
asshole .
you ' re not out of one body training class .
this teacher must really love you .
paula , what ' s wrong ?
i don ' t fit my pants .
why are you wearing them if you know they won ' t happen to you ?
they were before and i wanted to look good for you .
you look great .
i ' m gonna break this fucking mirror .
you look at yourself all day . . .
look at my breasts , big boys !
good .
you don ' t like big breasts .
don ' t lie to me .
i ' m so scared .
listen to me for a second .
paula , i ' m not sick of you .
you ' re sick of yourself .
how many more months of pregnant women look better than this ?
all of them .
they all tell me how amazing the pregnancy is .
that ' s not what i expected .
you can ' t go on like this .
this is nonsense .
i know .
you didn ' t invite anyone ?
put something on it .
i told my parents i wanted to take private lessons from you .
or at home i can ' t stand being at school .
i can ' t stand anywhere .
you ' re the only one who ' s been nice to me and who ' s bigger than i am .
you can ' t move , can you ?
i can do your shopping , make you company , make some cleaning . . .
you want a shelter ?
a little .
take your homework .
how ' s the new body training teacher ?
a jerk .
he ' s running without us stopping .
but i ' m just walking like you did .
i ' m keeping my blood sugar down .
in case your sugar falls ?
give me that .
open the book .
candy .
open the book .
fixed ?
yeah , all right .
if it breaks again , i ' ll break your head .
cabin 0 now , erika . . .
erika . . .
hi , honey .
how was work ?
good .
he was looking at his ass .
who , carlos ?
i ' m so excited !
i ' m not funny .
you ' re jealous .
no .
you think that ' s right ?
would you like me to look at the other girls ?
you wouldn ' t like it , would you ?
i don ' t think it ' s funny .
because i ' m not okay .
all i think about is having sex with you .
and again .
i see you dress like this and . . .
we can stop by the house by the way .
they brought another furniture ?
we ' re sex addicted .
no , we ' re addicted to love .
pilar . . .
we should start to get to bed .
i can ' t , i ' m scared .
fine , but i have to get out and find a new apartment .
find someone to stay and take care of you .
pilar !
the doctor said i ' m good enough to go on living normal .
what ' s wrong ?
you ' re my partner ' s wife .
we can ' t play happy couple .
fine , but you ' re gay .
nothing .
besides , we were friends before we met jesus .
remember when we slept together in college together ?
it sucks !
i was sure i was gay that day .
jesus hasn ' t been with me for 00 months .
i guess he was a little gay too .
pilar , no .
i ' m horny .
close your eyes and think i ' m a man .
no !
it ' s like i ' m one of those sexy kids you fuck 000 euros .
let ' s see what happens .
use some teeth .
that , that ' s kind , careful , careful . . .
just until you bend over and give me a blowjob .
you ' re a cowion ?
how was it ?
there ' s a blowjob .
you ' ll enjoy this experience as much as i enjoy it .
and him ?
did you do something to her ?
like what ?
like he did to you .
no , gross !
question , mr .rapist .
isn ' t it a bit extraordinary for you to talk about personal matters in the bar ?
a beer can uncover things that don ' t show themselves in a therapy .
like your straight relationships .
the priest really bothers me .
he ' s always talking about happy and cupcakes and another cupcake and another cupcake and another cupcake and another cupcake . . .
it ' s a tracker !
i think i just saw leonor leave .
i swear it was him .
another one !
what happened to the greed manager ?
i don ' t know .
one day she came to the wrong group .
sorry , i guess i came at the wrong time .
not wrong time , wrong day .
and he never came back .
i did , but he didn ' t answer .
then he sent a message saying he left it .
who wants potato chips ?
take one .
what was our deal ?
i only suggest potato chips .
if he gets it , i ' ll take it .
i feel guilty when i eat alone .
you told us to stop blaming ourselves .
it ' s just another thing to give up , you know , pushing other people ' s backs .
give me that fucking jeep !
no more guilt .
feel better ?
much better .
how much more pizza are we looking at ?
all i can get is a cold pizza .
"i ' m a fat fat fat pushed out of society , i can eat whatever i want ."
i don ' t want to listen to this anymore , understand ?
your excuses are ready .
yes , it is .
what is this ?
tickets to the school trip .
you never sold it .
i ' m not going to a party or a trip .
isn ' t samuel leaving ?
i don ' t think so .
shame , it looks good .
come on , like dad said .
one for you , one for me and everyone is happy .
okay .
you ' re right , only the fatest kid in class can like me .
fat couple , nice .
"how nice ." do you like him ?
he ' s a loser , ridiculous , rude , reckless , completely pathetic . . .
great .
you send him a message , you can eat a tongue .
if i don ' t have 0 wishes , there ' s no deal .
i ' ll take the candy from 0 and bags .
i don ' t have sugar in my bag .
okay .
not the big one , take the little one .
you don ' t eat ?
i don ' t eat snacks .
you never mentioned her .
spanish learning and become a good christian .
he will sing us a religious song from his country .
okay ?
come on , champ .
i call my friend sofia .
so marry me .
lovely .
imagine walking down this hallway with this music .
no , we ' re gonna have an argument .
koro can make a beautiful fatty music .
you can forget this music if you don ' t let me get my beard .
tarzan .
twisted .
okay , therapist .
you sure you don ' t want to close your eyes and let yourself flow ?
no , that wouldn ' t be ethics because i ' m your therapist .
so goodbye .
can i have another beer ?
you brought your boyfriend .
he ' s not my boyfriend , jackass .
he told me he was crazy about you .
i just spoke to her , she said you were great .
i hate alcohol .
relax , you get a job .
come on !
i hate alcohol too .
hi .
pilar , what are you doing here ?
without you , the pills don ' t work .
you don ' t belong here .
why ?
i can help you , idiot .
there ' s a little less loyalty .
don ' t pay .
why would you pay for sex ?
you can ' t have someone who really loves you .
i don ' t want to love anyone , understand ?
for not finding the right person .
i ' m not right for anyone , pilar .
come on .
i ' m gay , okay ?
i like men , don ' t you understand ?
get out of here !
go !
why ?
i can ' t hear you .
i pretended to be asleep when you came home late , and you still fucked me ?
yes , i remember .
i talked to my jinekol today .
you know , normal life .
okay .
i have something to do tomorrow .
relax , i ' ll be right inside .
you want me to fall asleep .
i want you to come to bed with me .
and i ' m telling you i ' m gonna clean up first .
paula ?
aren ' t yours helping you deal with your brother ?
mine only thinks of themselves and their perfect marriage .
all they do is fuck every day .
good !
you have to learn to protect yourself .
i found an unpleasant rat poison on the internet .
paula , if she ' s staying , i ' ll sleep on the couch .
you ' ll sleep in any kind of couch anyway .
come on , get it up .
a sana . . .
come on .
and me .
tastes good , right ?
even when i was a kid , i felt different .
i didn ' t like playing football or anything like these .
because if you ' re fat and alone , nobody asks you why you ' re not acting like the others .
no one would notice i was gay .
but i didn ' t surrender to my confusion until the 00 specials in the  ' 00s .
they let me volunteer , miracle in a miracle ,
and they gave me to the rings .
there was an incredibly handsome monte that kept me from getting him out of the pool without legs .
i don ' t know which one ' s making me happier , when he ' s got me on a wheelchair , or if he ' s smiling in a wheelchair or a virgin .
my first joke was a block .
i ' m tired of being gay .
really .
sensitive , happy , full life , expecting us to be nice .
first of humanity .
and that ' s not me .
i can ' t wait all night for muzice .
go .
you have to pay for everything .
i ' m a con man .
i ' m the worst faggot of all time .
i ' m a lying , mean , mean , brutal bumper .
i ' m a contradiction .
contradiction doesn ' t have to be bad .
they can always be open with something we ' re not always ready to face .
so it ' s better to not run away from them , face them and see where they take us .
because most contradiction of contradiction is the answer .
put your hands on your stomach .
close your eyes .
let ' s all breathe together .
take care . . .
breathe , breathe .
i thought your problem was pregnancy and it was me .
we all have contradiction .
they ' re the first step in our lives to understand what we want or what we don ' t want .
the one who ' s got you , but you worship ?
i broke it on purpose so i could go back there again .
i broke it .
but the pressure ?
but the one that made you free ?
the one who set you free , but the shame ?
what ' s sober and sober ?
what is it you refuse ?
are you doing this because you want to keep pretending everything is okay ?
society wants you to be fat .
if you fat everyone feels better because they feel better .
not anymore .
now time to take my first step .
put your life on your knees .
one move might change the dynamite .
but a diary isn ' t enough for a bottle of kilo-away .
kilo-away doesn ' t make miracles .
your success is long and hard on your need .
believe me , there ' s only one way to make it .
let ' s take step one .
white , pure and clear .
00 pounds light .
the dark brown is almost shit color .
00 pounds light .
once again , i beat the festival priest .
shall we choose a red flower that can identify ourselves , an astronaut or an ammonaut or an amazon , a tropic bird living in the amazon ?
i don ' t like big breasts .
let ' s see .
your badge level is higher .
not exactly pathological , but be careful .
you could be a diabetic .
your blood pressure ' s up .
after what you said , it ' s not weird .
don ' t worry , paula .
everything ' s gonna be fine .
just watch what you eat .
if you hadn ' t always been with that girl . . .
what ?
nothing .
what are you doing , big brother ?
blood , hair , nails , body spray , you can use it .
it ' s given an example of the political enzymes and ducts to separate the dna from the dna .
years ago this process was taking weeks .
this machine could be done in less than 00 hours today .
so half of your note is mine .
we ' re a pair of eggs twins , so the last three houses . . . these and . . . these guys have to match .
i wasn ' t closed .
i even had a very nice boyfriend .
the point is , it wasn ' t from the community .
i tried to get him involved in the plague , but he wasn ' t involved in the moods .
i mean , she didn ' t want to be a virgin until she got married .
she ' s tired of waiting and she left me .
i got depressed , but then alex came in .
actually , alex was always there .
two eggs , roast rice , shrimp noodle and moo shu pork .
do you have fries ?
a party .
i want a salad with beans .
i got really fat when i started dating alex .
i can still examine another body .
why ?
you must eat , you ' re big bones .
that ' s why i brought you to chinese restaurant .
let me eat whatever i want .
it won ' t work .
what happened to your cousin who lost weight in the gym ?
now look more fat than old-fashioned .
cover , sofia , for god ' s sake .
that ' s what the girls wear .
how long ?
come on , you like it .
of course you do .
you liked it .
you always do what you know .
you ' re pushing me out .
i ' m not hungry anymore .
you like what you did ?
you lost my appetite .
so , really , really . . .
you ' re a rebel .
how can i eat more than you without weight ?
i looked around and all i could find was you two big bits .
it was a bit more heavy than normal and your sister ' s .
fat bitch just ruined my life from the beginning .
you have a lot of baby photos .
i only found one .
and i was 0 years old there .
being adopted isn ' t so important .
it ' s not a family biologically emotional thing .
stop kidding !
don ' t say things like that .
i ' m gonna freak out and leave the house .
thank god .
luis , you ' re not adopted .
what about the dna test ?
if it ' s been done properly .
nuria probably forgot to make the angels of the example .
i did , i put them in the thermommomix vapor .
how ' d you put the parts in the nitroulosis ?
i went yellow to the alinium foil , and i kept it in the middle 00 minutes .
ten .
how did he do it again ?
because of what ?
because of me .
pilar , i ' m rehearsing .
so i can fuck you .
it ' s good to think of my analysis needs .
you don ' t . . .
of course i like it .
it ' s a great dick .
want to try ?
this is our rutin now .
we bring her chocolate , but because she can ' t eat , we eat .
then i throw up .
and then we share a whole super-date movie .
then i throw up super vomit .
then dinner , some champagne , a beautiful view . . .
and i . . . vomit .
then she ' s comforting me .
then i comfort him .
i die !
why do you think you ' re throwing up so much ?
some reasons i ' m not in my body long enough for me .
my digestive was watching normal , but suddenly he started working the opposite .
i know what you ' re thinking , therapist .
aren ' t you tired of this crap ?
aren ' t you really tired of reality ?
first time in my life is normal .
just as i knew you ' d come here to be able to keep eating like a pig .
she ' s convicting a man who doesn ' t deserve her .
what is it , paula ?
what is this ?
you tell me .
we ' ll discuss it later .
no , we ' ll discuss it now .
i don ' t care !
it ' s your fault i ' m unhappy all day .
is that how he treats you ?
does he throw your food away ?
does it make you feel like shit ?
or is he just doing it to me ?
explain to me why you don ' t love me , that you don ' t like me , that i make you sick !
just know how much i hate you .
and you , watch your fucking kids .
and now we know your shit , therapist .
"and the light came to the world . . .
 ' cause when the bad things make the light go away from the light that makes bad things go away , he ' s gonna hide them , and you ' re gonna
wait .
what are you doing ?
go on .
my turn , not yours .
your turn for what ?
since when do you have more than one orgasm ?
first you wanted to be on top , now you want to be orgasm twice .
what next ?
i don ' t know , we ' ll find out .
were you touching yourself ?
is that why you ' re staying so long in the bathroom ?
stop it .
are you crazy ?
don ' t mess with me .
come here .
don ' t be stupid .
you made me do everything !
damn !
look how upset you made me .
you think i like being like this ?
look at how i ' m doing .
you think that ' s good ?
look at me , sofia .
look at me .
you think i want this ?
no , my love .
i look at you , you look dirty .
dirty , dirty , dirty !
you . . .
damn dick .
what are you doing ?
i ' m trying to run it .
choking him is useless .
tell me the truth , dad .
i want to know the truth .
being weak doesn ' t mean you ' re not family .
you ' re disgusting , fat and ugly , but you ' re smart , like my mom , nuria .
you always treat me like an idiot .
i don ' t fit into this shitty family .
okay , i ' ll repeat the test to prove you .
but luis , you ' re so smart .
there ' s no stupid part of your body .
what the hell are you doing ?
we need a test .
i ' ve got to rip off their balls .
what a smart boy !
i ' ve been with you for ten years .
things start to get hard , right ?
or is this hard ?
am i the hard one ?
therapist who treats fat people can ' t stand the image of his own fat wife .
you brought your job home .
look at me .
you can ' t even look at me .
you don ' t like me anymore ?
tell me .
tell me what ' s hard .
i don ' t want to look at you !
i love you with all my heart and i can ' t think of a life without you .
it ' s like i ' m the smartest person in the world .
because you are .
it ' s called a "dumb letter ."
" my nanny asked jesus ,
 ' how can an old man be born ?
judah 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
the part i wrote .
"of course , i realize i won ' t be born again , i cannot go back to correct my mistakes .
all i can do is learn from them and not repeat them .
you ' re the one i want to be better and to be happy together .
i want to get in the way of adventure and salvation .
alex .
deal ?
yeah , deal .
will everything be the same ?
it ' ll be the same .
no sex until the wedding .
and my orgasms ?
okay .
and you ' ll get fat again .
what ?
you said: everything will be the same .
don ' t i look better now ?
of course you do .
that ' s why i told you .
to stop us from sleeping with the devil .
asshole !
all this time you ' ve always pulled me down , made me think i couldn ' t do better .
i ' m ashamed to be with you .
i ' m glad this happened today because i realized i never wanted to see you again .
dirty !
jesus ?
i ' m sorry , jesus .
first , me or you ?
you .
leave me , leave me , leave me !
i left him .
i love you , but i don ' t love you .
these relationships make a lot of addiction .
we decided to stay friends .
and when we agreed on that , we were together .
traditional good-bye sex .
i wasn ' t fat .
and i was pretty .
and light wild .
my doubts have begun .
maybe leaving wasn ' t a good idea .
we decided to be together .
every night , he came back asleep and fear .
he wasn ' t there to comfort me .
i felt so terrible i came to therapy on the wrong day .
sorry , i think i got the wrong time .
not wrong time , wrong day .
i came to the bar .
i didn ' t want to go home .
suddenly , i realized a man was always looking at me .
i thought i was so fat and i wanted to get up .
i asked the waiter account , but he said he paid for my drink .
i don ' t know how it happened , the guy came up with me .
we were drinking whiskey instead of coffee .
she kept saying how beautiful i was and she wasn ' t so bad .
and then i came to think of some new things i ' d just come to my mind about trying to try things to try to try and find myself in other men ' s experience , and i found myself . . .
that ' s how i met the second man i ever slept with .
what can i say ?
any therapy was better .
i was desired , not fat .
of course , the next week i still feel fat and disgusting , and i couldn ' t stop me from eating .
i was supposed to be comfort . . .
i was supposed to be comfortable .
that ' s how i met the third man i ' ve ever slept with .
but something made me feel like you wouldn ' t approve of my behavior .
your idea may not mean much to me , but i guess i wasn ' t ready to hear it .
let ' s go .
where ?
meeting your wife and kids in london .
where do you think you were ?
that ' s how i met the fourth man i ' ve ever slept with .
that was just like the second and the third one , handsome and happily married .
so i decided to continue sleeping with handsome and married men for three reasons:
i didn ' t want to get involved .
i ' m convinced this morning won ' t happen again .
what convinced you ?
german coming back .
i guess that ' s why i slept with all those men .
i thought it would be easier to forget german .
if he didn ' t leave me for 00 pounds , maybe he ' d leave because i slept with 00 men .
see , there ' s something i ' ve decided to go after him .
what did you decide to go after ?
i don ' t know .
i don ' t even know if i should ask you to help me or fuck me .
or fuck me .
because you ' re handsome and i know you ' re married .
and you , what ' s up ?
jesus !
i loved you so much !
paula !
pregnant lady , are you there ?
ice cream melting !
paula !
hi , i ' m abel .
i didn ' t understand why men with handsome and happy marriage would have to sleep with a fat woman .
i was wondering .
until you stop wondering one day .
so don ' t worry , i won ' t ask .
what ' s wrong ?
you ruined everything .
everything .
luis , it was a joke .
if i let your jokes affect me like that , i ' d already killed myself .
i ' m glad you ' re not my big-ass twins sister .
stop crying .
of course we ' re twins .
if our fathers are different , we ' re not .
what ?
two different fathers are different fathers different fathers
you did good this time !
tell me who you are !
tell me !
tell me !
what ' s going on ?
what ' s going on here ?
tell him who his father is .
you ' re my father .
at least tell him !
tell him who you are !
he deserves to know who his father is !
tell her who you fuck with me !
i ' ve put up with you all my life !
i ' m in this shitty life !
hi , i ' m abel .
please come .
i ' m so scared .
what are you doing , pilar ?
i ' m trying to put your wedding ring on , but i can ' t .
he lost weight in a coma .
forget it .
listen to me .
go home and get a glass of milk from these sleeping pills .
emotionally surprised .
what are you doing ?
let me try .
he liked it too .
marry me .
what are you saying , pilar ?
shall we go straight to the funeral wedding ?
you should think about it .
i ' ve been thinking .
marry me , please .
why would a good-looking , smart and loving woman marry a gay woman ?
me .
i don ' t understand .
my love for you is true .
i don ' t even know if you like me a little bit .
i live for you .
just for you .
marry me .
loading video .
it ' s loaded with fat fucks .
i never expected you to be perfect for 00 years because you were already .
you were perfect for me .
we were perfect for each other .
we had everything .
i know that happens once in life .
i ' ll be in the hospital for 0 days .
when i get out of here , i want you to leave the house .
you know , it ' s more than anything .
today we discuss the role of the man and woman in the marriage .
it may seem very clear , but it ' s more tricky than you think .
no , my love . . .
please , don ' t . . .
don ' t go !
come pray with me !
sofia , what ' s wrong ?
somebody do something .
please !
you should do this yourself .
but the only thing you can trust is yourself .
and you ' ll just taste victory .
my 0 0 '  my 0 0 0
i never took care of my kids .
they were even intruders who were there just to get a headache and get upside down .
the point is , what if one of me isn ' t ?
i shouldn ' t mind , should i ?
i should be pleased .
00 yesterday .
i didn ' t think i ' d live this long .
i wasn ' t right .
even if i die , i can ' t lose weight .
i ' ve been obsessed with finding nia ' s real father and lived in a tent for 0 months .
i ran our family dna test , our friends , our neighbors .
even on sunday after lunch with lunch at the countryside , instead of sleeping with beatriz , i got an example from my sister f .
