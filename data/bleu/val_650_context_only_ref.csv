well, first of all, it's tomorrow.

a monkey could make it.
and i had prepared to covertly attempt it with cindy.
yes, but mr. stoller, i must tell you i'm sure your wife was a very nice woman.
i know you don't like it but a woman gets control when her hand's on the dumbstick.

as it's been said identical twins share dna, but they're different people.
it does go to their individuality.
any sign of him ?
they might cross a pit bull with mike tyson.
but the truth is every time science is advanced, it raises concerns over the future of humanity.
my client knows the wishes and dreams of his wife.
the question can't be who owns her dna, can it ?
his kids might get to play in a sandbox with the twin of their great-grandmother.
celebrities might start selling off their dna.

how old do you think these kids are ?
none of them look older than 21, 22.
so they might have been recruited from some college math department like those m.i.t. guys back in the' 90s.
and you're just gonna let that go'cause she wouldn't sleep with you.
he was my high school math teacher.
but before any one of these kids leaves, danny has to get their picture and information.

that was the day i stopped caring about myself and started my life of service to the great people of san diego.
well, s-she did light him on fire, so.
there's a guy in your office, and he's gorgeous.
i sent you three texts, and you didn't return any of them.
and i couldn't find my underwear until i pulled them out of my purse while paying for coffee.
he cares about other people.
looks like it.
all of a sudden, i want to make a connection, and i don't have the first clue how to do it.
sometimes it's a real pleasure to work for you.

hey, tuck, you wanna try some pop-ups while i get them settled ?
i was going to talk to you myself, but bonnie said she'd handle it.
it would take a lot more than a baby.
maybe it'd be a good thing if you took over for a while.
i'd hate for anyone to have to cancel their plans.
the dentist said he could see me right now.
it's the bathroom key.
but if mom asks, they had to put me under for a root canal.

it's not how it.
a room full of trophies and nobody to share them with ?
danny seems to have it figured out.
never really tried it before.
beat it.
hey, i know my boy's work when i see it.
i believe it's called the wheeler.
we'll use you to monitor it from the inside.
patty, i saw the guy who did it.
we must have chased him out before he had time to steal anything.
she always wore it.
no, but... it looks like he's lying about everything.
whatever you've dragged your company into, it better not involve anything other than retrieving stolen documents.
daniel purcell is a brilliant man, but when he faced patty, he collapsed.
i don't know who killed your wife, but you are gonna get blamed for it.
i didn't know if we had to do it again.

it's you and me, jack.
i mean, it's at least 100 miles to the nearest cop.
best we, uh, kill them and take their product.
it is a long story, all right ?
it should be right up here.
i got it back at the shop when you were on the phone.
can we call it even ?
we can hardly call it a victory.
it is a long story, all right ?
why'd you do that ?
that's wholesale.
they use echolocation, a kind of sonar, to find their prey.
if these little fish stay close to the coral the sharks won't be able to get at them.
and he's got to try and get the boat ahead of the whale, but not in front of it.
this series is all about hunting, and so nice though it is to have that shot to make a sequence we've got to get shots of blue whales eating krill.

we're going to go take a look at it.
when mia went on exchange, we wrote up a pros-and-cons list and it helped clarify our feelings.

my brother will break your heart, and when he does, i'm not going to be there to supply the tissues.
""" it'll be so fun! """
it's on, princess!
she's dead.
i didn't realise it required a response.
of course it did.
look, if you want to know the truth, i was embarrassed by it.
and then you go and write all that stuff and send it to everyone ?
it doesn't have their pictures or their id numbers.
you got it.
all these kids out of business school think they're worth $ 100,000 after one week on the job.
i hate their attitudes.
he's a shady character.
she's okay, but it's pretty serious.
a guy in the math department told me about it.
they make those heat sensors for cryogenic capsules.
she won't admit she's actually had a heart attack.
she's lying there going into cardiac arrest, she's claiming it's indigestion.
it felt more like gas pains to me.
because i don't think he was a real doctor.
uh, just put them right there.
i'll put them in your old bedroom.
mario said he took it pretty hard.
i didn't want to push it.
mom has a schedule and their life is essentially one long routine.

it's double coupon day at ralph's.
i didn't take it.
i was afraid i couldn't pass it.
johnny, a good driver knows when he's not a good driver anymore, that's all.
i mean, mom's okay, but they really like to, uh, limit the number of visitors.

it should only be a day or two.
he's like a regular wife.
mom looks good, doesn't she ?
it loses money every day it's open but the property it's on is worth at least $ 50 million.
and getting it off your books ?
i think we can turn it.
now our cash flow projections for the division may look aggressive but we're comfortable with them.
i didn't know you knew about stuff like that.
we're just gonna buy the company and then close it down.
that's your job ?
you buy companies, then close them down ?
the cannery itself is sitting on prime waterfront land.
so we buy the company, close it down, then we sell off the subsidiary business, then we sell the land.
it's against the law.
i bet the girls are falling all over themselves.
good thing they didn't have it when i was in school.
he was a physical education major.
you'd read them, we'd go back, get out another four books.
they've got a little community going.
it's, uh, it's fun.
might as well do it right.
she said i should use my best judgment.
we haven't talked about it up until now, and i think i know what i want.
i wouldn't be surprised at all if it were just a cyst.
what is it ?
it's just something to relax you.
what time is it ?
you know, john, i see men now, they hug.
i love you, too, dad.
it's beyond anything rational.
their children tend to underestimate them.
jake, it's me!
they often go into delayed shock even after minor surgery.
it comes and goes.
i'm sure, with proper rest and medication, the situation will correct itself.

it seems to me that he's been very thorough and professional in your father's case.
he has to balance the will of the family members with the patient's right to know.
i don't believe it.
he's crying nonstop.
you can pick him up anytime after 12 : 00.
you can't handle him in this condition.
i think i can do it.
it was a slip of the tongue.
this kid gooden is fabulous, isn't he ?
he kind of reminds me of bob gibson.
""" let's sleep on it. """
it's very hard, i realize for children to understand that their parents have gotten old.
i think he might be better than dr. santana.
i'd like to see if i can get him to take a look at your father.
annie, that man got up every day of his life and went to a job he didn't like.
we didn't ask him to.
but rather, it was your love and caring that called your father back from where he'd gone.
she'll probably laugh and call me crazy, but she'll laugh.
ah, it's a good idea.
and it's almost as much fun.
over the years, he hasn't been getting enough pleasure out of his daily life, so he's isolated his greatest joys into a dream.
is she just shut out ?
the problem is your father's participation in this world is totally tied up with your mother's approval.
what will people think if they see you like this ?
it's very important that you support him right now.
i think it should be pointed out to him.
he's trying.
the doctor thinks he's making a lot of progress.
he keeps coming into my bed at night.
your father's always been a highly sexed man, but since he came back from new jersey, it's insane.
when we first got married and i told my friend fanny hogan the things we were doing, she told me to leave him and notify the police.
you know, when your father gets excited, police, priests, prayers, nothing is gonna stop him.
he's just trying to enjoy himself!
as a matter of fact, he's very impressed he didn't go insane just hanging around you for 30 years!
he wants his life back.
you look at me or people look at me and they see this old man.
it's not good.
i like it there.
it's a real family.
because i liked the power of it.
and something had to give and it was my family.
it didn't seem like it.
well, that's because we tried to make it look normal.
i don't want to miss him.
tell it to me.
hit a smash, deep left field, had home run written all over it.
everyone in the stands knew it.
he's racing after the ball.
and he doesn't realize it was hit by joe dimaggio.
this man who never showed any emotion, he was human after all.
um, and this seemed like the right place to do it.
the last corpse was decomposing by the time i took a scalpel to it.
cos your man's grip was too loose and now he finds himself staring down this handsome spada da filo.
its curator is a man called lupo mercuri.
they say lorenzo medici himself has asked for you.
well, with this commission, you'd be wise to overcome it.
when it comes to miss donati, boredom is the last thing i fear.
they operate cranks, which rotate the wheels.
he would have been born with wings, yes.
i believe man will fly and i base this assumption on the fact that god has blessed us with minds that are capable of imagining it.
oh, he played on a woman's vanity.
the jew that was hanged, i want you to unearth his body.
i need to examine it.
i knew it was you from the moment you approached me.
get on with it, then.
it would appear the turk has found a new champion.
continue watching him.
force the other guy to counter, and he'll open himself up.
why would they show this to me now ?
well, it worked.
maybe she can tell us what billy did to her partner before he snapped.
the blood in that car, some of it is his.
angel feels responsible for this guy because he brought him back from hell.
i feel responsible because he did it to save me.
some lose their mind in an instant.
i was cut, torn up, my face disfigured and burning with pain not knowing if it would end or just get worse till i died.
"and no woman strong enough to wear the mantle of "" vicious bitch "" would ever put up with it."
hacking 1 4 years, i understand why he did it.
so however billy's putting the mojo on people, the power's in his blood.
which means it could also be in his sweat, his saliva or even his touch.
maybe mommy and daddy never explained to you that men, grown men are wired a certain way.
he wants money, leave it on a table.
"it's just an apple. """
poor, helpless, battered woman needs to vent her feelings about the injustice of it all.
you don't have the nerve to do it.

it's not just walls and roof shingles to me.
but we do know, based on the analysis of the vectoring of the disease is that it could be our ground zero for infection.
it's not over.
i don't get it.
is it who i think it is ?
well, if it's happened, it's happened in san francisco.
cops don't give up evidence like they used to.
i don't get it.
well, that's your job, isn't it ?
she has allergies and a special diet.
i hit her with a hairbrush until it broke.
well, we both are... very strong-willed, you see.
then whose is it ?
i can't wait when mommy gets home so i can show her.
yes, i am sure she will be thrilled.
i'm sure she'll turn up in no time.
i agree, but this isn't it.
don't think like that.
i'm used to it by now.
this guy is here to rave about how great it is.
ladies and gentlemen, i'm not going to do it.

it got stuck in his throat and he choked to death.
the maitre'd gave him the heimlich, but by the time he got the ring out it was too late.
i was curious and... i licked it clean.

what a shame, it looks so good.
it sounds like tarzan.
he's not my boyfriend, jerk-off.
loosen up, you'll get the hang of it.
my folks only care about themselves and their perfect marriage.
all they do is fuck all day long.
you were going to anyway.
come on, put it away.
they can always be explained by something that we're not yet ready to face.
that's why it's better not to run from them, but to face them and see where they lead us.
i break it.

it's not quite pathological, but you have to be careful.
today, with this machine, it can be done in less than 24 hours.

luis, it was a joke.
trying to put on his wedding ring, but it doesn't fit.
i don't get it.
it may seem obvious, but it's trickier than you might think.
my body came around and stopped rejecting the things it didn't like.
it's all a lie.
it's all that jerk alex's fault.

they found us a few hours ago.
they've already taken up too much of our lives.
they hunt prey few other cheetahs would dare to tackle.
they were not close enough to take over the attack.
and all three cheetahs are onto it.
their only assets are cloven hooves that spread under load, astonishing balance... and the most uncanny agility.
finally, the fox gives it up as a bad job,
the incredible agility of the stoat, practised since it was a kit, was just enough to swing the balance.
but they're leaping out of the frying pan and into the fire.
they've come here to fatten up for the winter.

i don't even know him!
you know how it works.
but he took it personally.
i don't get it.
he did ?
he was there for her when her dad died.
a rumor had it... she might've killed herself.
she thought she was with this friend... who actually was home that night.
it earned me a doctorate.
send him in.
doesn't it smell ?
it was jungho's idea.
that cop said he'd handle her.
it's a nervine but not on the market.

and smote him, thus.
say what you have to say with speed and put the audience out of its misery!
my lords, ladies and gentlemen thank you for your generosity of spirit.
the doctor said he'd come to his rope's end and found it frayed.
but all the able-bodied ones are in uniform and the theatres are bombed as soon as you book them.
