they use some sort of dokolok isolation that has some kind of radar up their hunt to find their prey.
but these little fish fishes spend most of their time in the depths of the deep in the deep ocean but they're not gonna be able to reach them.
they only hunt when they go up to the surface to feed.
when they found a big bunch of big stuff, dol dol dolphins are using their radar radar for something other purpose.
when dolphins feed dolphin' around again closing time to keep their hunts from escaping safe depths again. they come from the bottom of the pack.
and as it gets lower as the food is on the surface below the food is so the hunters must do everything in their power to protect their precious energy.
most of them are drifting around tracking tentacles loaded with deadly needles only. lighter.d.
the others are slowing down the darkness with the back row's roar from the back of their rage from the swift swift swells,.

these deep water flowing details that give a lot of calm people also draw these vultures for these at the same time.

both sharfish are also made a trip between the other mountain between galapagos and the other end of the great ocean in every mountain of the great ocean.

it's the same size as the black albatross frigate fregat birds with the same size as the three-sens more, but that's why he needs a totally different flying style of flight
albatross has the tallest wing angle of the longest a bird, and that's gonna make him give power from the power of the south polar sea wind.
first before the wind blows against the wind, they're using his energy up high s.
and then they turn and grab and wind and fast, and they win, they win.
they spend weeks in the sea, most of the time looking for preyons in search of prey ever return to land.
because the wind is so strong here the albatrosses can't afford the heavy oil that don't water their feather feathers waterprot waterpro waterprot water water
they can dive like duck duck for about a foot about so they'd tie their prey up to the south polar sea that would move their prey from their range to their range to their range it'll move up

he comes here every year to raise around half a half a million albatross puppies of albatross babies.
the adults are coming back to feed their babies for a few days a couple of days to feed back for a couple of days, and now they come back in here,
when the feeding process is over, it is time for you to head straight towards the sea.
the albatross are so heavy that they can just bark from places where the wind is strong enough.
from the air it looks like the ocean's unimportance unimportant on the surface but there is always strong current flowing through the surface.
the current current that current current life here is more effective than any other forces at it to determine life here.
all the organisms that are being dragged into the ocean are gonna take that flow connected to these flow.

john's had vital information from these harmless labels. that was vital.
part of this research and a part of the reason we're working with the producer and producer film producer and part of the reason we're working with it as a unique opportunity to get us scientific data that we cannot get us any other way.
that's why we're doing this because of our research authorization to get an idea of how they swam underwater what they're doing underwater and how they're smearing how they feeding.
the success of a team is based on a good six- water clearing.

then david has to go in the water and hope the whale's had enough to take the whale off the record. he near enough.
this year the water is unusual but it still takes time to keep david in a good position.

sharing the water with a blue whale of a blue whale and an eyeball is something i never will ever forget.
and the opposite backside. the opposite backside.

dr. ehridge is an dr. ehhridge
i don't trust santana. i don' around.
you are the hospital manager at the hospital manager and what i'm trying to say is that it does not comfort us.
dr. santana is a nice young surgeon. it's a young sur
it seems like he's been perfect and professional and professionalizing about your father.
i told him never to tell my dad he had cancer because he's too scared of that word.
but what he did immediately went and said to him.
yeah, you know it's hard for every doctor for every doctor to say that.d.
she has family members of that family that have to balance the balance in your father's right to inform them your father's need to be notified
i'm sure she had no choice but. i'm sure she
she had an option. she had a choice.
he should have listened to me. he should have listened to my
i know my father my dad. i know my dad
why did you tie her arms?
to not hurt her self her self her self her self-

mr. treemont-
don't you keep telling me his condition's unusual, doctor. don't keep telling
it's not unusual depressive depression but it's true, but it's a sedative that will bring him around.

how can we know?
he never got any medical help!

that's not a good place for him right now. that's not a good place
she can't do it at home and she can't do it in here either.
maybe it'd be better if he'd just stay on top with a helicopter.
i know it's difficult for kids to admit that their parents are getting old.
say what that means.
i know what it's like to get old. i know what it
mr. treemont and you cannot forget that the doctors are also people. people.
we can't deal with all the problems.
we can't save every patient. we can't save every
we end up in a system where old people get really into trouble. we live in a system where they're from the old people
what is your request?
why are you here?
there's another doctor in this hospital.
i think the doctor can do better than that from santana. i think.
what
i'm kicking every word being said.
he's a good man. he's a
i want your father to take a look at your father. i want him to take a
mr treemont?
mr treemont?
how are you doing mr treemont?
let's run a few inspections. let's do a
let's get an eeg let and locate their metabolic disorder.
let's get some calcium-magnagnesium and we'll run some vital vital function tests.
i don't know very sure what caused this to though really make my diagnosis right now... that would be a epilepticismic diagnosis.
the real question is, what caused this?
and no conscious?
if you're going to have another consultation about this you can do it in a way you can do it with's. please.
no, you don't need that don' that don' no
well, like we said, don't think we're gonna sit in our place and do nothing about it.
we don't think we do.
we've run a serial test so far we're gonna do a lot more than that.
all we've ever done so so far is fire only in darkness.
i appreci appreciate your humb humbly app appreciate your humb humb humb
but it's been a long time since these tests have been done, right?
we're gonna lie here for a while more time and we're gonna watch him from the monitor every minute. we're gonna be watching him from
and i'm gonna check him twice a day and visit him twice a day.
i won't let her out of her head until she's well.
i'm afraid that's totally against hospital rules.
how long can you hold on to that?
i don. no. i don. i
once a day i go. once a day. once a day
i sit. i. sitting. i. sitting
i talk to him. i talk to him. i
i come in and talk about what i've been talking about
i figure if i sit there and i talk to him it wouldn't kill him.
what if he dies?

to prove he's still here. to prove he's still here.
to prove that i'm his son.
so what have you done positive so far?
annie, this man has gone to work in his life every day in his life and never loved him for never having ever loved
we never asked him. we never asked him.
he did it because he was father and he had no choice but. he had no other choice.
he never asked himself if i'm happy or happy.
he never knew whether he had it right. or not.
and that choice has to look after him and take care of him when he's alive the result of that choice, and we have to
but i've done this. i've done this.

i am very embarrassed to him... my mother dominated him. my mother against him.
he's getting old now too. he's getting old
you know, i've made a horrible marriage out of my heart because i made a bad marriage work there is an unbelievable job, and i have a son who would barely recognize him if i saw him on the street.
maybe it's gonna be too hard for me and i.
