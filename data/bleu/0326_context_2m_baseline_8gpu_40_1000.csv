michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, his brother, buster, shared his bed.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for both of us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i'll tell him
i have to write at least 000 words about the moral side of the war and the ability to prevent a conflict.
i'm not sure our ethics teacher would appreciate me cheating while writing a essay.
so, you passed my moral test.
actually, gorgeemichael was desperately abused... with the teacher of bethbaerlyad.
small-time offenders can be brutally chopped off.
no ring ring ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
the g.d.k. was on us.
your father thought it would make us look good.
he must have faked my signature.
'i may have a son who finished his cottage cheese a year ago!
you've got to get me out of
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't take care of her
i no longer have a mother's tenderness and milk.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls... a couple
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yes-yes.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
by the way, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
why do i tell you this?
i guess there's some things you can't tell your father about
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set his teacher with his father... so he could do his mothering duty.
there's nothing wrong with that.
but still, i have to tell you i'm a little hurt because you don't think about it.
aunts can do that.
teachers can fill that role.
surely, one day, you will find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay had never been more proud of what she said in her life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i was telling you about.
girl, really... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma," you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache
yeah.
but gob misunderstood the emotional appeal michael had been courtesy... and felt he was fighting to get involved.
because, you know, beyond adorable... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
[ nazhgalia, michael, shannon] really?
and a surprise visit to george sr. was about to arrive.
i read all your teachings and got all your tapes.
and i watched it all again.
george sr. had recently marketed a series of tapes... of himself telling people... to make money for his new spirituality.
i also lost two pounds to eat your banana bluth jail bars.
i've come to find out where
this is a good place to start.
and michael met lindsay at parent-teacher night after dating two girls who were dating.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this rape room have the same floor plan as our kitchen?
i think he's really good for you.
i thought you'd get it out of your head.
besides, i can't hurry up and marry someone just because my son wants to.
i'm miss baerly, the ethics teacher
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life... that could be lost by the impenetrable of an insensitive
and michael got to know his son's ethics teacher.
that's the "rrrrr" side.
you know, it's annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you were laughing.
"rrrr!" - "rrrrrrrr!"
but, you know, ... ...
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite you for a drink?
or... or...
yes, he's dead
i think it's because of this whole mr. daniels stroke thing...
let's go have a drink.
maybe it will help.
george sr. was dealing with his own admirer.
i've already told you so many of my sins.
maybe you can tell me some of your sins.
well, there are legal demonstrations that show my sins.
but let us return to your sins.
tell me about one of those... what happened at the university dormitory again.
and what did michael have to do with his second date with miss bayerly today...
michael, that little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with him.
at least, i think it's him.
you have to rob her to the underwear to tell her for sure.
yes, mother.
they'll take him back.
don't take off your shoes, little man!
don't take off your shoes!
it's out of
who is it?
this is annyong, your father and i have adopted.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you find a new son?
lucille found out that she was worried, even jealous.
and he knew what it felt like to be ignored.
annyong is your sister's your sister
cancel it.
he's stay
listen, i'll call you sonar again.
nice driving.
are you making dinner reservations?
it was a little korean.
and after the dates...
michael took a step he hadn't taken in
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how are we supposed to sneak in without waking everyone up
this might not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but apparently we're even now.
you took someone i love.
i took someone you loved.
"nashbagerajam"...."
listen, i know you're trying to get back at me about marta.
i was lying to you when i told you i wasn't gonna try to sleep him, so...
he has to accept that.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
honestly, i had a chance to get rid of him.
it's ok
so romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but first i don't know if it was real.
but now, now... your moral teacher...
yeah, i did that for her.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm sure he's interested in her.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
about his class?
i mean, that he loved her... the sadd
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with her.
so why did he do that?
why did he sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new... new... new...
he's not one of the good snipers targeting him, and he almost shoots everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, you think he's old for you, don't you think he's old
we don't even know how old he is.
nobody knows.
she was escorting young girls at different dances... and i thought i'd go to her, and, you know, do something...
"hey, you want to dance?"
and i thought, "oh, what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it different in front of the mirror, but
but, you know, um, we danced with jokes or something.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should date someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've just grabbed a book that's hard to get a picture of saddamey's bathroom suite.
"what did sadadad do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's the same as our fire escape.
in prison, george sr was preparing for an evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon makes his own preparations.
how we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael called the family expert on making trouble while still angry at gob.
i know you're dating shannon.
that cheerleader?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid,
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i called mr. daniels and i asked him... but he was breathing and he dropped the phone.
i never heard back.
you know, maybe we should both go together.
right, i mean, he was a bad example...
hello.
my mother took him.
she's making me record her for school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss george michael's condition with ms. bearly.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
i want to talk to you about it.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morals... about mor
you see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's like in love with you, so...
he knows we're dating.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most contrary thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been a moral teacher half a semester
look, it was a preemptive act.
my brother was trying to sleep with you.
so, i want to leave you right now and i won't come back to you.
i understand.
starting now.
george sr. went for a walk with cindi.
george.
and she got to know him.
you can pour it all to me right here.
it weighs upon my soul
you, you...
he's picking up the camera
so, it's your dinner, away with mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy
watch your back, my little immigration brother!
and the different spring dances were in the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting him in because he doesn't have a strong square jaw with his perfectly shaped eyes, like you.
you want to dance?
all right!
gob finally found shannon he was looking for...
gob had found out he was cheating on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i ruined our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about it a lot, and-and-and
that's... that's what you mean by the right
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school dance?
i'm only here with my girlfriend.
yeah, my ethics teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my moral teacher.
i'm really moved by you trying to protect me after i treated you so badly.
in fact, gob mistook michael's ethics teacher with domestic research.
man, your type... understood.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a local teacher.
act two.
i was seeing ms. baerly, and i shouldn't have dragged gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed over some sad things, but...
i don't think we'll have a future.
and, jeremy, i'll take that cake.
hey, you want to dance?
i can't believe this is working.
the next arrested development.
buster's conflict gets heated.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
no candles allowed here.
my mom would go crazy.
no, it's okay.
i burn my own candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna
you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
it's ok
here, let me help you.
these too?
okay, i'll move it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is something really extreme.
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die
we'll all go someday, won't we?
four months ago, each of you attended an interview to attend a never-been tv show.
and guess what?
you win.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm totally gay, and i'm proud of
you're cute, aren't
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel, england.
me too.
that's my brother stanton; my probation officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him in the head.
he doesn't know
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they look like barack obama these days.
each one of you will make $00,000, all you have to do is spend one night in this prison.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
damn!
great.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know if this is a prank?
right.
this is actually our third show, but we're not publishing it until the fall.
to see if this is a prank, you're gonna have to play and earn the money.
you will be asked to perform a series of tasks.
missions will force your borders, your courage and your thinking.
sounds fun, doesn't it?
what kind of assignment are they, man?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i don't even have a girlfriend who's gonna take this
i need to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
around.
you'll notice.
the total money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if you all make it through the night, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can make me spend the night here.
anybody else wanna join him?
i'm not.
there's no way i'm going to the city with this
i'm in
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him
bye.
you guys are idiots.
it's a fucking joke, they're gonna fuck you all.
you're nothing but a bunch of idiots.
can't you see this record is a party.
or become famous.
there's a human head in there!
don't worry, it's not
looks pretty real to me.
that's why they call it "special effects."
pretty cool, huh?
a little sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thank you to our special effects team for the award.
follow me, my friends.
in hot swamp water, lazy crocodiles await their prey.
the indian crocodiles become tall and pathetic.
that kind of crocodile...
guys.
i see you're working hard as usual.
ready?
we're all set
and absolutely.
keep it that way.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great you scared them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are joining the show.
you looked really severed.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really gives me the creeps when
did you know that?
the homeless who died?
sure.
why didn't you say anything?
must be a big coincidence.
do you really think it's safe there?
safe enough to get the show insured.
any more questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're recording.
each one of you was chosen your own free will, spending the night in jail to make $00,000 a head.
clear enough, isn't it?
okay, let's party.
you can find everything you need in your main camp, that's the principal's office.
where?
it's compl
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you took everything we had, how can we write it down?
go down the hall, turn right, again right, then left.
straight to the stairs, left, right, another left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
there you will find a key to escape your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought leaving the basement was terrible.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to the mission.
can you just not do that?
i can't see a damn thing in here
does anyone remember where we're going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, two right, then left.
it was too much flat.
no, straight down the hall, flat down the hall,
"turn around, make a right again, and left.
"then straight to the stairs, stairs,
"sola, right, and left again".
what are you?
smart.
illet, this is gonna be a great show
careful.
careful.
jesus.
what is this place?
and get ready.
it was fun.
let's give them some speed.
okay, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't
the power's running, the generator should have kicked in by now.
damn!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here
it's freezing in here
look, the key.
yeah.
okay.
hey, guys
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think he's the principal
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what, man?
"hello, brave contestants.
"welcome to warden clem harvis' office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room
"this chess piece will determine your personal role.
"you cannot change your stones with other contestants.
"the rags were his favorite".
now it's your turn to put your hand in the box.
shit.
well, who wants to go first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't
what do you mean you don't know
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black rook.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
damn!
that was really crazy.
my little piggies, welcome to the mission.
now, let me tell you about pennyville state prison.
in the time of crisis in 0000, when the cost was increased, the brutal warden thought to raise his fortune by destroying some charges.
they were prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the director's crimes were released.
the last person to be sentenced to death here was warden harvis himself.
rumor has it the warden's still roaming the halls.
tonight you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured spirits under this building.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
anybody want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the prison church to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first hallway.
nice job with sound.
thank you.
damn!
what?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, take it easy, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung babies!
their children... their
i think they got it covered with speakers.
voices are more effective than images to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
jesus!
sounds great.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't
something came up.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're loud, randall.
really.
okay.
oh... my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flashlight.
okay now?
open the bible to the marked page...
"you will find god's prayers there.
"00 years ago, this holy place was disrespected,
"now this is the chamber of unusual events."
oh... the opposite.
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit
i can't do
"when you complete your mission...
"if there's no sign from the principal,
you can go back to camp".
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry, whoever i'm bothering
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
" save us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"do not let evil rule us.
"protect us from the breezy...
"give us our debts, as we forgive those who owe us.
"and give us our daily bread today.
"as heavenly in heaven...
"like the sky,
"because domination and dominance are yours."
please tell me i can go now.
"before going camp"...
jesus, randall, you have to put out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look what they do for money.
where'd he go?
as far as i can tell, the people who did this job have cut off our connection to our homosexual friend for a bit longer to get a more scary vibe.
whatever.
definitely, it's gone smoothly.
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, man, it's not that bad.
definitely not worth the money.
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm done.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it
they can still serve you again.
don't joke
i swear, you don't even know how people feel down there.
it's like walking in heavy fog, just cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next.
what do you mean?
some cameras weren't working?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated
let's have scelzi take a look down and fix it.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy
either we talk or i go.
it's important to me too, taylor
what do you mean?
i did a little research.
and by "research," you mean the local girls you slept with?
am i right?
big lips, broad thighs, taylor.
okay, this prison wasn't just for men
is there a women's department?
and that bloody freaky warden would roam around the women's section naked, never answer anyone.
he used to beat them, rape them, get pregnant, starve them to death.
some people say they feed their own babies.
what's that supposed to mean?
what do i mean?
this true story will improve the show!
anyone could be talking about us.
that's nothing compared to the story you invented.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do that, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
really?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yeah, they work.
good.
scelzi, what is that?
just a little something to make me take the night off.
you want some?
get your hairy ass over here, okay?
aye, aye
hello?
you scared the hell out of me.
i got some good stuff.
suit yourself.
we're all ready to begin.
i'd say my biggest fear is to be buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will take you to freedom of liberty."
okay,
i'm at the end of the freedom
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and take a right.
damn!
what?
blood.
it's not real
no cursing, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs are up, not down.
i'm sorry
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
you'll see a door with a finger as soon as you get down.
he says... he says
damn!
"welcome to prison number five.
" considering the violent and insanity and madness,
shit.
tell me what to do... so i can get out of this hell.
no!
thank you.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a prisoner can't commit suicide, then, if
"now you shall live the punishment of a prisoner."
okay, where's the
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult mission.
"what are you gonna do when you're in the hole
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my job.
connie.
what?
check this out.
what?
can't...
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back, and you specifically told me... that the show added something, and you still ask why you got fired?
this is not our guy.
where'd he go
who the hell is this?
i don't
don't look at me.
look, connie, you gotta get that guy out, okay?
he's gonna screw
damn!
we'll be ruined.
so you didn't bring this?
not with cuts.
it's obvious
what's open?
come closer.
i asked you why you were putting cameras in the control room.
yeah.
the surveillance foot surveillance on the back of the camera
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
it's brilliant, is
absolutely brilliant.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants us to record how scared you are by putting something on the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black king and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you could be reassigned.
he knows a lot
okay, black king and white knight turn right and go to the gas chamber.
white queen and black horse go straight, and they go to the prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"king and knight turn left and right.
"to the end of the alk and the cartway, go down
"and go down the stairs".
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, open it.
we're in.
"welcome to the gathering room.
there must be a light on the wall behind you, open it.
"black king and white knight are entering the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
it deserved the best, it was the whole place.
it's the only place the legal department cle
isn't it beautiful?
pretty gruesome.
jesus.
what's that smell?
documented facts of execution rooms often carry the smell of death itself.
of course the smell is not death.
if a man knows his life is coming to the end of his life, his concern is caused by his emitting matter.
in that case, the smell of the gas that we breathe now smells of the person we breathe is the sm
it's fun time, ladies and gent
the black king sits in the chair.
black king?
that would be me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you will find some meat and some attitude.
you'll cook this meat and eat it.
man!
prisoners always eat meat cows, pigs...
"or because it's not a lamb or a lamb...
"who suspected he had become..."
"think they've never tasted before, thought it was a nice meat
you mean human flesh, don't you?
are you in there?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i give up.
you'll tie toni up.
i'm giving it to you, toni should completely live the fear of the prisoners just before the gas is given.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends had some weird requests.
you okay?
okay.
"your mission is your teammate...
"to find the main valve and shut gas without killing."
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to puke.
okay.
strange.
i can't do
i can't
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
no more "no more pranks."
remember what you said?
if the team wins, they'll pay extra money".
do it for the team, girl.
you gonna puke?
thank you.
okay, angel, i'm at the bottom of the stairs.
shit!
can you hear me?
he's back
it really stinks.
let me out.
come on.
let me out, man.
jesus!
who's the guy standing there?
topless.
muscles.
let me out.
i don't know, con. this guy is starting to creep
stop playing games.
let me out.
how's it going
we need to talk to you.
outside?
yeah.
i have big news.
i think the company's playing us.
what?
who's there?
