michael shared his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, the one he shared his bed was his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i will.
the moral side of the war and i have to write a test of at least 000 words about a conflict.
i'm not sure our ethical teacher would like me to cheat while writing a trial.
so, you passed through my ethical test.
in fact, gorgeemich was desperately burned to his teacher at bethbiberly.
small crimes... even the people's hands can be cut loose.
he doesn't have a ring without a
try to remember everything he said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
you have to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
g.d.k. was on us.
your father thought it'd make us more benevolent.
he must have imitated my signature.
'a year ago, maybe i'll have a son who's finished his sweat cheese!
you gotta get me out of this.
i'll call social services, but you should get buster back.
but i can't look at him either.
i don't have a mother's kindness and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little conflict.
i'm sending you an olive branch here.
yes-yes.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
by the way, lindsay was giving george michael a homework.
why would i tell you that?
i guess it's because there are things that people can't tell their father.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to arrange his teacher to give him his mother's duty.
there's nothing wrong with that.
but i still have to explain to you that i'm a little hurt because you don't think about it.
and auntie can do it.
and the teachers can do it.
sure, someday, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay's never been so proud of what he said all his life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this shannon is the girl i keep telling you.
she's really... she's a young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma," you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the moustache.
yeah.
but gob michael's courtesy misinterpreted the emotional interest... and felt he'd been fighting to get involved.
because, you know, beyond love... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
is nazhgalia, michael, shannon really?
and there was a surprise visit to george sr.
i read all your teachings and bought all your tapes.
and i watched them all again.
george sr. had recently released a series of tapes he'd given to his people to make money from the spirituality of his new discovery.
i also lost two pounds to eat your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to find out.
this is a nice place to start.
and michael met lindsay at parent-teacher night after he got away from two girls he was on a date.
hey, linds, is this my imaginary product... or does that lightning room have the same kitchen plan?
i think he's very good for you.
i thought it'd get him to get his mother's concept out of his head.
besides, just because my son wants to get a job like this, i can't get married to someone.
i'm miss baerly, the ethics teacher.
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life... that could be destroyed by an impulsive trigger.
and michael's getting to know his son's ethics teacher.
that's the "rrr" part.
you know, it's really annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you were laughing.
"rrrr!" - "rrrr!"
but, you know, ...
and i guess i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite you for a drink?
or... or... or... or... or
yeah, he's dead.
well, i guess that's because of mr. daniels having a stroke.
let's go have a drink.
yeah, maybe it'll help.
george sr. was dealing with his own fan.
i've already told you so many of my sins.
maybe you can tell me a few sins.
well, there's legal indicators showing my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me about one of those things that happened... at the university dorm again.
and what's going on with mrs. bayerly, who's got a second date today... and michael's date... today is
michael, that little korean came, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it's him.
you're supposed to rob him to his pants to make sure.
yes, mother.
they'll take him back.
don't take off your shoes, little sir!
don't take off your shoes!
he's out of control.
who is it?
it's "momong," your father and i adopted it.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille figured buster was worried, even jealous.
and he knew what it felt like to be ignored.
annyong's your brother's your brother's your sister
cancel.
he's staying.
listen, i'll call you back.
it's been a good time.
making reservations for dinner?
he made a "pain korean".
and after their meeting...
michael's taken a step that he hasn't thrown in years.
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we leak in without waking everybody up?
that may not be my best idea so far.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry, michael, but apparently we're even.
you took someone i loved.
so i got someone you love.
i'm nashbagerlajam...
listen, i know you're trying to get back at me from marta.
i was lying to you when i said i wasn't gonna try to sleep with her, so...
he's gotta admit it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
seriously, i had a chance to get rid of him.
no problem.
so romantic.
who's "n.a.-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i gotta say i didn't know it was real first.
but now... now... your moral teacher...
yeah, i did that for him.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, in terms of the matter, i'm sure you're interested in him.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
about his class?
i mean, that he loved her... my saddam... my saddam
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with him.
well, why would he do that?
why did he sleep with my morality teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new...
it's not one of the good shooters that targeted you, and it's almost everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, he's old for you, don't you think?
we don't even know how old he is.
nobody knows.
he's been escorting young girls in a different dance, and i've been thinking about going to him with a joke, and...
"hi, you wanna dance?"
and i thought, "what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it in front of the mirror, but...
but, you know, well, we've been dancing with jokes or doing something else.
i didn't think so.
don't you think you should go out with someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've identified a hard book to find a picture in the bathroom suite of saddam.
"what would sadam do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's the same thing about our fire escape.
in jail, george sr. was preparing for his most loyal fan.
the genie lightballoon is doing his own preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael, while he's still angry at gob, he's gone to find the family expert on creating problems.
i know you're dating shannon.
that ponpon girl?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid changes.
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels, and i asked him... but he was breathing and he dropped his phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe i should go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hi.
my mother took it.
he's making me record him for do.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the situation with mrs. bearly and george michael.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
i want to talk to you about that.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality...
see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, he's like in love with you, so...
he knows we're out.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most dumbest thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been a morality teacher for half a semester.
look, that was a preliminary move.
my brother was trying to sleep with you.
well, i'd like to leave you at the moment, and i'm not going back to you.
i see.
from now on.
george sr. went for a walk with cindi.
george.
and he's getting to know him.
you can make me feel completely comfortable here.
it's weighting on my soul.
you...
he's getting the camera.
i'm gonna take you to the dance, this is your dinner, so she's away now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy.
watch your back, my immigration little brother!
and the different spices were in the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you don't just let her in because she doesn't have the perfect-looking nose like you, the apartment-shaped eyes, the strong square jaw.
you wanna dance?
all right!
he finally found the shannon he was looking for...
gobun found out he was cheating on him with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
sorry.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i fucked up, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about this for a long time, and-and... and...
that's... that's what you mean.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school party?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, with my ethics teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my morality teacher.
after you've been so bad to you, you've been trying to protect me, and i'm really sensitive.
as a matter of fact, gob has mixed up with the morality teacher of michael's dating.
man, he... he understands.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a domestic teacher.
act two.
i've been seeing mrs. baerly, and i shouldn't have let gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked him, i didn't know what else to do.
i never wanted to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're exposed to that.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed on some sad things, but...
i don't think we'll ever have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm taking this cake.
hey, you wanna dance?
i can't believe this is working.
he's in the next armored development.
buster's heating's checks.
stop, stop, stop, stop!
no candles allowed here.
mom's going crazy.
no, it's okay.
i'm burning my candle.
yeah, that's what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
no problem.
right here, i'll help you.
these too?
okay, here, i'll carry it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is something really extreme.
too much.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we'll all go one day, won't we?
four months ago, each of you came to an interview, to join a tv show that has never been done.
and guess what?
you won.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm a real gay man, and i'm proud of that.
you're so cute, aren't you?
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel, from england.
me too.
that's my brother stanton, my probation officer.
hi.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him in the head.
he doesn't know.
but i know.
dixon, 0'0", 00.
people say i look like will smith.
they look like barack obama these days.
each one of you will make $00,000.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
damn!
great.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know if it's a donkey joke?
right.
this is our third show, but we're not gonna publish until the fall.
you're gonna have to play and earn the money to see if this donkey's a joke.
you will be asked to perform a series of duties.
the missions will force your boundaries, your courage and consideration.
that sounds fun, doesn't it?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where am i signing?
i didn't even have a girlfriend to admit that when she was high.
i need to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some people died there.
like what?
go around.
you'll notice.
the money will be divided equally, but if you all get the night out, you have a rich reward.
no money can make me spend the night here.
anyone else want to join him?
i'm not.
there's no way i'm going to the city with this pissed kid.
i'm in.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you're stupid.
it's a fucking party joke, they're gonna fuck with all of you.
you don't look anything but a bunch of idiots.
can't you see this is a party taken on this rock.
or we'll be famous.
there's a human head!
don't worry, it's not real.
looks pretty real to me.
that's why they call it "special effects."
that's nice, isn't it?
a small sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thank you for our rewarding team.
follow me, fellas.
in hot swamp water, lazy crocodiles await their prey.
the indian crocodiles are long, and they're slimy faces.
these crocodiles...
guys.
i see you work hard as usual.
are we ready?
we're all set.
and absolutely.
go on like this.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great to scare them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are gonna join the show.
you looked really scared.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really gives me the creeps.
did you know that?
the homeless who died?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
it must be a big coincidence.
do you really think it's safe there?
the show's safe enough for the insurance.
any other questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're on the record.
each one of you was chosen by your own free will to spend the night in jail to make $00,000.
it's clear, isn't it?
all right, let's get the party started.
you can find everything you need at your base camp, that's the principal's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you got all of us, how could we write?
go down the corridor, turn right, right again, left.
go straight to the stairs, left, right, and another left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
you'll find a key to get rid of your chains there.
is there anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought it was terrible to leave the basement.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to the mission.
can you not do that?
i don't see any shit here.
anybody remember where we're going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, two right, then left.
there was too much going on.
no, go straight down the hall, down the hall, down the hall, down the
"turn around, make it right, and left.
"then go straight to the stairs,
"sola, right, and left again."
what are you?
smart.
illet will be a great show.
careful.
careful.
oh, god.
what is this place?
and get ready.
it was fun.
let's speed them up.
okay, queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
the power's running, the generator should have come in already.
damn it!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's freezing in here.
look, the key.
yeah.
okay.
look, everybody.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who's that?
i think he's the manager.
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what's up, man?
"hi, brave contestants.
"welcome to clem harvis's office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room.
"the chess stones will determine your personal role.
"you cannot change your balls with other contestants.
the rags were his favorite.
now it's your turn to put your hand in the box.
shit.
well, who wants it first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't know.
i don't know what that means.
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
that's not cool.
black hawk.
black castle.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
damn!
that was really crazy.
my little pigs, welcome to the mission.
now i'll let you know about pennyville state prison.
in the time of crisis in 0000, when the cost was increased, the ruthless warden thought to increase his fortune by destroying some of the charges.
they were prisoners!
the warden's crimes were already executed for 00 prisoners until he was released.
the last person to have been sentenced to death here was principal harvis himself.
rumor has it the warden's still hanging around the halls.
tonight you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured souls under this building.
first assignment.
your white queen.
try not to die!
anybody want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
" white queen must go to the prison church to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first corridor.
that sounds great.
thanks.
damn it!
what happened?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, relax, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung babies!
their children... their children... their children...
i guess they've got it all covered with speakers.
sounds are more effective than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
god!
that sounds great.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
something came up.
i think someone's in the room with me.
they're calling from the speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flashlight.
okay now?
open the bible page from the bible...
"you'll find the lord's prayers there.
"00 years ago, the holy holy place was disrespected,
"now, this is an unusual room of events".
oh, my... the opposite.
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do that.
"when you complete your vision...
"if there's no sign of the director,
you can go back to camp.
a deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry if i'm bothering you.
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
" save us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"do not let evil rule us.
"protect us from being overcome...
"as we forgive those who owe us, forgive our debts.
"give us our daily bread today.
"as in heaven...
"as in the sky, as it is,
"because domination and domination are yours."
please tell me i can go now.
before we go camping..."
god, randall, you gotta put out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look at what's done for money.
where's he gone?
from what i understand, the people who did this job have cut off our contact with our homo friend for a while to give it a more scary weather.
whatever.
definitely, he's gone in a jam.
guys?
i think we've done something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
have you seen anyone?
no.
come on, dude, it's not so bad.
definitely not worth the money.
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it again.
they can assign you again.
don't joke.
i swear you don't even know how people feel there.
it's like you're walking in a busy fog, just cold like ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting cold in here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you expect me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated.
let's just send scelzi down and check it out, you're 00.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go downstairs and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
either we talk or i go.
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i made a little research.
are you talking about the town girl you slept with?
am i right?
big lips, large hips, taylor.
okay, prison wasn't just for men?
any part of the women?
and that fucking nutcase madwoman wandered around the section, never answered anybody.
he'll beat them, rape them, get pregnant, and kill them hunger.
some people say they feed their own babies.
what's that supposed to mean?
what do i mean?
this story will increase the attention of the show!
anyone could be talking about us.
it's nothing compared to the fact that you've made that story.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
yeah?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yeah, they're working.
good.
scelzi, what's that?
it's just a little something to get me out of the night.
you want some?
get your hairy ass over here, okay?
aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the shit out of me.
i've got a great stuff.
suit yourself.
we're all set to begin.
i can tell you my biggest fear is to be buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will take you to the freedom of liberty."
okay, okay, okay
i'm at the end of freedom.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
damn!
what?
blood.
it's not real blood.
no cursing, sherlock.
i like that girl.
please tell me you're upstairs, not down the stairs.
i'm sorry.
my 00?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down, you'll see a finger door.
he says... he says... he says... he
damn it!
welcome to cell number five.
"if we think about the violence and the madness that's infected,
shit.
tell me what to do... and i'll be out of this hell right now.
no!
thanks.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a convict can commit suicide, if a convict can't, he can't,
"you're going to be sentenced to a prisoner."
okay, where's the pit?
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
that's a pretty tough task.
"what are you gonna do when you get in the hole."
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my duty.
connie.
what?
look at this.
what?
can't... can't be...
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back, and i specifically told you... you added something to the show, and you're still fired?
that's not our guy.
where'd he go?
who the hell is that?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you gotta get that guy out, okay?
he's gonna get it in the show.
damn it!
we're screwed.
so you didn't bring that there?
cut it out, no.
it's obvious.
what's obvious?
come closer.
i asked you why you were putting a camera in the control room.
yeah.
the camera behind the camera... they want to record the footage... they want to record the footage
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
genius, isn't it?
definitely genius.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to record how you scared us by putting something in the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black horse and white horse.
mission four.
black castle and white queen.
i told you there could be a mission again.
very smart.
okay, black horse and white horse go right back to the gas chamber.
white queen and black horse go straight, and they go to the prison kitchen.
okay, then.
good luck.
"the hawk and the horse go right after the left.
"tale and horse go to the end of the corridor,
"and go down the stairs".
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, open up.
we're in.
"welcome to the pack room.
there must be a light on the wall behind you, open it.
"black king and white horse are entering the gas chamber."
that's nice, connie.
that's where he deserved the best, and it's all real.
it's the only place the legal department cleaned up.
it's good, isn't it?
pretty scary.
oh, god.
what's that smell?
a real hanging room often carries the smell of death.
of course the smell isn't your death.
if a man knows his life's recent moments of his life, he's worried that he's got a lot of stinking stench.
in that case, what we're worried about is the smell of human smell and the gas that killed him.
now it's fun, ladies and gentlemen.
black hawk is sitting in the chair.
black king?
that's me.
wait for further instructions.
"there's some meat and you'll find a piece of advice.
you cook this meat and eat.
man!
the prisoners always eat the meat they eat, pig...
"or because there's no lamb, and there's another flesh...
"they were suspicious of what happened.
"they thought they'd never tasted before."
you're talking about meat, aren't you?
are you in there?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i gave up.
you're gonna get toni.
i'm sending it to you, toni should be absolutely scared of the previous prisoners before the gas has been released.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends were having weird demands.
