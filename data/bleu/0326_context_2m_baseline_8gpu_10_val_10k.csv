michael shared his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, the one he shared his bed was his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i will.
the moral side of the war and i have to write a test of at least 000 words about a conflict.
i'm not sure our ethical teacher would like me to cheat while writing a trial.
so, you passed through my ethical test.
in fact, gorgeemich was desperately burned to his teacher at bethbiberly.
small crimes... even the people's hands can be cut loose.
he doesn't have a ring without a
try to remember everything he said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
you have to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
g.d.k. was on us.
your father thought it'd make us more benevolent.
he must have imitated my signature.
'a year ago, maybe i'll have a son who's finished his sweat cheese!
you gotta get me out of this.
i'll call social services, but you should get buster back.
but i can't look at him either.
i don't have a mother's kindness and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little conflict.
i'm sending you an olive branch here.
yes-yes.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
by the way, lindsay was giving george michael a homework.
why would i tell you that?
i guess it's because there are things that people can't tell their father.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to arrange his teacher to give him his mother's duty.
there's nothing wrong with that.
but i still have to explain to you that i'm a little hurt because you don't think about it.
and auntie can do it.
and the teachers can do it.
sure, someday, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay's never been so proud of what he said all his life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this shannon is the girl i keep telling you.
she's really... she's a young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma," you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the moustache.
yeah.
but gob michael's courtesy misinterpreted the emotional interest... and felt he'd been fighting to get involved.
because, you know, beyond love... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
is nazhgalia, michael, shannon really?
and there was a surprise visit to george sr.
i read all your teachings and bought all your tapes.
and i watched them all again.
george sr. had recently released a series of tapes he'd given to his people to make money from the spirituality of his new discovery.
i also lost two pounds to eat your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to find out.
this is a nice place to start.
and michael met lindsay at parent-teacher night after he got away from two girls he was on a date.
hey, linds, is this my imaginary product... or does that lightning room have the same kitchen plan?
i think he's very good for you.
i thought it'd get him to get his mother's concept out of his head.
besides, just because my son wants to get a job like this, i can't get married to someone.
i'm miss baerly, the ethics teacher.
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life... that could be destroyed by an impulsive trigger.
and michael's getting to know his son's ethics teacher.
that's the "rrr" part.
you know, it's really annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you were laughing.
"rrrr!" - "rrrr!"
but, you know, ...
and i guess i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite you for a drink?
or... or... or... or... or
yeah, he's dead.
well, i guess that's because of mr. daniels having a stroke.
let's go have a drink.
yeah, maybe it'll help.
george sr. was dealing with his own fan.
i've already told you so many of my sins.
maybe you can tell me a few sins.
well, there's legal indicators showing my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me about one of those things that happened... at the university dorm again.
and what's going on with mrs. bayerly, who's got a second date today... and michael's date... today is
michael, that little korean came, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it's him.
you're supposed to rob him to his pants to make sure.
yes, mother.
they'll take him back.
don't take off your shoes, little sir!
don't take off your shoes!
he's out of control.
who is it?
it's "momong," your father and i adopted it.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille figured buster was worried, even jealous.
and he knew what it felt like to be ignored.
annyong's your brother's your brother's your sister
cancel.
he's staying.
listen, i'll call you back.
it's been a good time.
making reservations for dinner?
he made a "pain korean".
and after their meeting...
michael's taken a step that he hasn't thrown in years.
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we leak in without waking everybody up?
that may not be my best idea so far.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry, michael, but apparently we're even.
you took someone i loved.
so i got someone you love.
i'm nashbagerlajam...
listen, i know you're trying to get back at me from marta.
i was lying to you when i said i wasn't gonna try to sleep with her, so...
he's gotta admit it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
seriously, i had a chance to get rid of him.
no problem.
so romantic.
who's "n.a.-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i gotta say i didn't know it was real first.
but now... now... your moral teacher...
yeah, i did that for him.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, in terms of the matter, i'm sure you're interested in him.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
about his class?
i mean, that he loved her... my saddam... my saddam
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with him.
well, why would he do that?
why did he sleep with my morality teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new...
it's not one of the good shooters that targeted you, and it's almost everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, he's old for you, don't you think?
we don't even know how old he is.
nobody knows.
he's been escorting young girls in a different dance, and i've been thinking about going to him with a joke, and...
"hi, you wanna dance?"
and i thought, "what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it in front of the mirror, but...
but, you know, well, we've been dancing with jokes or doing something else.
i didn't think so.
don't you think you should go out with someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've identified a hard book to find a picture in the bathroom suite of saddam.
"what would sadam do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's the same thing about our fire escape.
in jail, george sr. was preparing for his most loyal fan.
the genie lightballoon is doing his own preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael, while he's still angry at gob, he's gone to find the family expert on creating problems.
i know you're dating shannon.
that ponpon girl?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid changes.
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels, and i asked him... but he was breathing and he dropped his phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe i should go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hi.
my mother took it.
he's making me record him for do.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the situation with mrs. bearly and george michael.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
i want to talk to you about that.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality...
see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, he's like in love with you, so...
he knows we're out.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most dumbest thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been a morality teacher for half a semester.
look, that was a preliminary move.
my brother was trying to sleep with you.
well, i'd like to leave you at the moment, and i'm not going back to you.
i see.
from now on.
george sr. went for a walk with cindi.
george.
and he's getting to know him.
you can make me feel completely comfortable here.
it's weighting on my soul.
you...
he's getting the camera.
i'm gonna take you to the dance, this is your dinner, so she's away now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy.
watch your back, my immigration little brother!
and the different spices were in the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you don't just let her in because she doesn't have the perfect-looking nose like you, the apartment-shaped eyes, the strong square jaw.
you wanna dance?
all right!
he finally found the shannon he was looking for...
gobun found out he was cheating on him with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
sorry.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i fucked up, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about this for a long time, and-and... and...
that's... that's what you mean.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school party?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, with my ethics teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my morality teacher.
after you've been so bad to you, you've been trying to protect me, and i'm really sensitive.
as a matter of fact, gob has mixed up with the morality teacher of michael's dating.
man, he... he understands.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a domestic teacher.
act two.
i've been seeing mrs. baerly, and i shouldn't have let gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked him, i didn't know what else to do.
i never wanted to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're exposed to that.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed on some sad things, but...
i don't think we'll ever have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm taking this cake.
hey, you wanna dance?
i can't believe this is working.
he's in the next armored development.
buster's heating's checks.
stop, stop, stop, stop!
no candles allowed here.
mom's going crazy.
no, it's okay.
i'm burning my candle.
yeah, that's what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
no problem.
right here, i'll help you.
these too?
okay, here, i'll carry it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is something really extreme.
too much.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we'll all go one day, won't we?
four months ago, each of you came to an interview, to join a tv show that has never been done.
and guess what?
you won.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm a real gay man, and i'm proud of that.
you're so cute, aren't you?
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel, from england.
me too.
that's my brother stanton, my probation officer.
hi.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him in the head.
he doesn't know.
but i know.
dixon, 0'0", 00.
people say i look like will smith.
they look like barack obama these days.
each one of you will make $00,000.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
damn!
great.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know if it's a donkey joke?
right.
this is our third show, but we're not gonna publish until the fall.
you're gonna have to play and earn the money to see if this donkey's a joke.
you will be asked to perform a series of duties.
the missions will force your boundaries, your courage and consideration.
that sounds fun, doesn't it?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where am i signing?
i didn't even have a girlfriend to admit that when she was high.
i need to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some people died there.
like what?
go around.
you'll notice.
the money will be divided equally, but if you all get the night out, you have a rich reward.
no money can make me spend the night here.
anyone else want to join him?
i'm not.
there's no way i'm going to the city with this pissed kid.
i'm in.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you're stupid.
it's a fucking party joke, they're gonna fuck with all of you.
you don't look anything but a bunch of idiots.
can't you see this is a party taken on this rock.
or we'll be famous.
there's a human head!
don't worry, it's not real.
looks pretty real to me.
that's why they call it "special effects."
that's nice, isn't it?
a small sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thank you for our rewarding team.
follow me, fellas.
in hot swamp water, lazy crocodiles await their prey.
the indian crocodiles are long, and they're slimy faces.
these crocodiles...
guys.
i see you work hard as usual.
are we ready?
we're all set.
and absolutely.
go on like this.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great to scare them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are gonna join the show.
you looked really scared.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really gives me the creeps.
did you know that?
the homeless who died?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
it must be a big coincidence.
do you really think it's safe there?
the show's safe enough for the insurance.
any other questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're on the record.
each one of you was chosen by your own free will to spend the night in jail to make $00,000.
it's clear, isn't it?
all right, let's get the party started.
you can find everything you need at your base camp, that's the principal's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you got all of us, how could we write?
go down the corridor, turn right, right again, left.
go straight to the stairs, left, right, and another left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
you'll find a key to get rid of your chains there.
is there anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought it was terrible to leave the basement.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to the mission.
can you not do that?
i don't see any shit here.
anybody remember where we're going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, two right, then left.
there was too much going on.
no, go straight down the hall, down the hall, down the hall, down the
"turn around, make it right, and left.
"then go straight to the stairs,
"sola, right, and left again."
what are you?
smart.
illet will be a great show.
careful.
careful.
oh, god.
what is this place?
and get ready.
it was fun.
let's speed them up.
okay, queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
the power's running, the generator should have come in already.
damn it!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's freezing in here.
look, the key.
yeah.
okay.
look, everybody.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who's that?
i think he's the manager.
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what's up, man?
"hi, brave contestants.
"welcome to clem harvis's office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room.
"the chess stones will determine your personal role.
"you cannot change your balls with other contestants.
the rags were his favorite.
now it's your turn to put your hand in the box.
shit.
well, who wants it first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't know.
i don't know what that means.
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
that's not cool.
black hawk.
black castle.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
damn!
that was really crazy.
my little pigs, welcome to the mission.
now i'll let you know about pennyville state prison.
in the time of crisis in 0000, when the cost was increased, the ruthless warden thought to increase his fortune by destroying some of the charges.
they were prisoners!
the warden's crimes were already executed for 00 prisoners until he was released.
the last person to have been sentenced to death here was principal harvis himself.
rumor has it the warden's still hanging around the halls.
tonight you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured souls under this building.
first assignment.
your white queen.
try not to die!
anybody want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
" white queen must go to the prison church to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first corridor.
that sounds great.
thanks.
damn it!
what happened?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, relax, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung babies!
their children... their children... their children...
i guess they've got it all covered with speakers.
sounds are more effective than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
god!
that sounds great.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
something came up.
i think someone's in the room with me.
they're calling from the speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flashlight.
okay now?
open the bible page from the bible...
"you'll find the lord's prayers there.
"00 years ago, the holy holy place was disrespected,
"now, this is an unusual room of events".
oh, my... the opposite.
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do that.
"when you complete your vision...
"if there's no sign of the director,
you can go back to camp.
a deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry if i'm bothering you.
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
" save us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"do not let evil rule us.
"protect us from being overcome...
"as we forgive those who owe us, forgive our debts.
"give us our daily bread today.
"as in heaven...
"as in the sky, as it is,
"because domination and domination are yours."
please tell me i can go now.
before we go camping..."
god, randall, you gotta put out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look at what's done for money.
where's he gone?
from what i understand, the people who did this job have cut off our contact with our homo friend for a while to give it a more scary weather.
whatever.
definitely, he's gone in a jam.
guys?
i think we've done something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
have you seen anyone?
no.
come on, dude, it's not so bad.
definitely not worth the money.
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it again.
they can assign you again.
don't joke.
i swear you don't even know how people feel there.
it's like you're walking in a busy fog, just cold like ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting cold in here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you expect me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated.
let's just send scelzi down and check it out, you're 00.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go downstairs and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
either we talk or i go.
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i made a little research.
are you talking about the town girl you slept with?
am i right?
big lips, large hips, taylor.
okay, prison wasn't just for men?
any part of the women?
and that fucking nutcase madwoman wandered around the section, never answered anybody.
he'll beat them, rape them, get pregnant, and kill them hunger.
some people say they feed their own babies.
what's that supposed to mean?
what do i mean?
this story will increase the attention of the show!
anyone could be talking about us.
it's nothing compared to the fact that you've made that story.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
yeah?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yeah, they're working.
good.
scelzi, what's that?
it's just a little something to get me out of the night.
you want some?
get your hairy ass over here, okay?
aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the shit out of me.
i've got a great stuff.
suit yourself.
we're all set to begin.
i can tell you my biggest fear is to be buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will take you to the freedom of liberty."
okay, okay, okay
i'm at the end of freedom.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
damn!
what?
blood.
it's not real blood.
no cursing, sherlock.
i like that girl.
please tell me you're upstairs, not down the stairs.
i'm sorry.
my 00?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down, you'll see a finger door.
he says... he says... he says... he
damn it!
welcome to cell number five.
"if we think about the violence and the madness that's infected,
shit.
tell me what to do... and i'll be out of this hell right now.
no!
thanks.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a convict can commit suicide, if a convict can't, he can't,
"you're going to be sentenced to a prisoner."
okay, where's the pit?
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
that's a pretty tough task.
"what are you gonna do when you get in the hole."
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my duty.
connie.
what?
look at this.
what?
can't... can't be...
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back, and i specifically told you... you added something to the show, and you're still fired?
that's not our guy.
where'd he go?
who the hell is that?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you gotta get that guy out, okay?
he's gonna get it in the show.
damn it!
we're screwed.
so you didn't bring that there?
cut it out, no.
it's obvious.
what's obvious?
come closer.
i asked you why you were putting a camera in the control room.
yeah.
the camera behind the camera... they want to record the footage... they want to record the footage
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
genius, isn't it?
definitely genius.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to record how you scared us by putting something in the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black horse and white horse.
mission four.
black castle and white queen.
i told you there could be a mission again.
very smart.
okay, black horse and white horse go right back to the gas chamber.
white queen and black horse go straight, and they go to the prison kitchen.
okay, then.
good luck.
"the hawk and the horse go right after the left.
"tale and horse go to the end of the corridor,
"and go down the stairs".
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, open up.
we're in.
"welcome to the pack room.
there must be a light on the wall behind you, open it.
"black king and white horse are entering the gas chamber."
that's nice, connie.
that's where he deserved the best, and it's all real.
it's the only place the legal department cleaned up.
it's good, isn't it?
pretty scary.
oh, god.
what's that smell?
a real hanging room often carries the smell of death.
of course the smell isn't your death.
if a man knows his life's recent moments of his life, he's worried that he's got a lot of stinking stench.
in that case, what we're worried about is the smell of human smell and the gas that killed him.
now it's fun, ladies and gentlemen.
black hawk is sitting in the chair.
black king?
that's me.
wait for further instructions.
"there's some meat and you'll find a piece of advice.
you cook this meat and eat.
man!
the prisoners always eat the meat they eat, pig...
"or because there's no lamb, and there's another flesh...
"they were suspicious of what happened.
"they thought they'd never tasted before."
you're talking about meat, aren't you?
are you in there?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i gave up.
you're gonna get toni.
i'm sending it to you, toni should be absolutely scared of the previous prisoners before the gas has been released.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends were having weird demands.
are you okay?
okay.
"your mission is to assign the gas teammate...
"before you die, find the main vans and cut the gas."
you should watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to throw up.
okay.
strange.
i can't do that.
i can't.
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
"no more prank."
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they'll pay the extra money".
do it for the team, girl.
are you gonna throw up?
thanks.
okay, angel, i'm down the stairs.
shit!
can you hear me?
he's back.
it really stinks.
let me out.
come on.
get me out, man.
god!
who's standing there?
without it.
muscles.
let me out.
i don't know, con, this guy's starting to scare me.
stop playing games.
let me out.
how's it going?
we need to talk to you.
outside?
yeah.
i have big news.
i think the company's playing with us.
what?
who's there?
who are you?
show me the gas chamber.
and what are we gonna do with the fort?
where are they?
i don't know, just give me a few seconds.
there.
that man again, see?
wow!
who's that?
okay, how did he get here so fast?
isn't that the guy in the picture?
yeah.
yeah, he looks like him.
nice.
no, not cool at all.
this guy can go through walls, or there's more than one man.
we all watched "pricej," didn't we?
do you mind if we pass?
please?
guys?
guys?
fake blood, fake case.
they did good.
maybe even oscar will.
no.
no, that's not true.
it's completely out of scenario.
sounds real to me.
connie, they're playing with us.
trust me.
what?
hey.
they copied your picture.
what?
acting.
clothes.
easy.
stop.
no.
no.
he's a real ghost.
i can't translate any more.
if it gets any further, he'll be out of my sight.
what?
this is a very big prison.
i can't put cameras anywhere.
show me the pit.
show me the gas chamber.
taylor, somebody should go over there and see if they're okay.
i can tell you they don't look good.
he's acting.
where's scelzi then?
i don't know.
he's probably hiding somewhere.
i'll call the office.
okay, you too.
night.
they don't know what's going on.
i feel like you're getting worse.
okay, i'll go and prove it to you.
no problem.
anyone?
i'm coming.
i'll get my camera, maybe i'll get some good footage.
thank you.
you should be nice to them.
you're gonna fucking do it!
"you're gonna fuck up."
you know what?
you really are photogenic.
you're funny, kid.
i want to do my duty now.
close the air condition.
come on.
connie, what do you want to do?
stop the game.
wow, this place is haunted, isn't it?
it's getting a little weird.
where'd he go?
i don't know.
i didn't see him.
it's headed this way.
this won't work.
what was that?
yeah, what was that?
shit.
taylor?
get angel on screen.
we gotta get them out of there.
can you hear me?
listen to me.
there have been some changes in the plan.
we need to stop the show.
what?
why?
i'll be honest with you.
there's another one with you.
who?
we're not sure.
i want you to get out of there as fast as possible, okay?
are you playing games with me?
you're trying to scare me.
open the door.
i want to win and get my money.
open the door!
who opened the door?
sorry, you're not serious, are you?
idiot!
your mission is to memorize the location of the cell that's marked and find.
lucky!
in this cell, the warden harvis was wounded deadly by a convict.
you're gonna find a key in that cell, and it's gonna free your friend in the hole and the gas chamber.
great.
is that all?
it was the easiest money i ever made.
what am i afraid of?
nothing.
angel!
stanton?
help!
well, now it's out of my sight.
hello?
who's there?
hello?
angel?
angel.
put me down.
who are you?
angel?
angel!
what... what... what... what...
it's not real.
put me down.
wait.
it's you.
no!
angel, are you okay?
he killed my brother.
he's gonna kill me too.
he killed my brother.
new jersey school.
it's not bad for someone like me, is it?
connie, are you there?
yeah.
how could you organize this?
we've been pretty tough.
it's gonna be a great show.
i'll see you later.
i'll get this shit out first.
you're such an asshole.
you said you wanted a great show, didn't you?
you got it.
yeah.
solve se toni, i'll take dixon and stanton.
okay, snow, we're cutting.
people, get cleaned up and change.
prepare for pati and champagne.
excellent acting.
show's over.
toni?
good job, dixon.
okay, dixon.
it's over, man.
are you okay?
stop playing, snow.
you gonna say something?
we gotta get them out of there.
we gotta get them out of there.
get that out of my face!
advance to new coordinates: 0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0
copy that, atc.
i'm spying on my little eye that starts with y.
if you can't understand, you'll lose as punishment.
rain?
london was supposed to be in cia custody 00 minutes ago.
the car's waiting.
it's a good thing we're not in a hurry.
the traffic tower says they'll be moving in five minutes.
the interior ministry's locker has been compromised.
we're gonna have to be a little more creative about our fund.
where the hell is oliver?
where's the surveillance video?
you can break the rules, but you need a special order.
something must be done.
chief.
i know you don't like hearing this from a politician, but reform is coming.
do you know that elevator was just for emergencies?
guard vehicle 0, what's your status?
are you restless, juney?
you'd be a lot less nervous if you just kept being my london girlfriend.
that position won't stay open for long.
i'm spying with my little eye that starts with that letter...
engines, they're going fast.
get them on the screen.
calum, the nearest police units?
whatever we have, come on.
code 0!
attack!
oh, god.
june, for god's sake, don't.
get down, now!
lethal force has been allowed to use.
open the van or everyone dies!
open the truck, now!
pearce.
the americans will crucify us.
your operation, harry.
say again, command centre?
put your weapons down and release qasim.
what the hell are you doing, harry?
open the gates!
open the gates!
come on, come on, come on!
command, the prisoner has escaped!
he's going north!
no, no!
keaton!
the command centre is chasing agent 0 ya.
any other footage?
follow her.
the nearest armed unit is five minutes away.
the helicopter is 00 miles away.
barriers?
in position.
the other side of the tunnel is the last one.
they have nowhere to go.
sco00 is five minutes away.
go.
agent 0, report.
ed, wait.
agent 0, report.
i repeat, the cia contact officer has been shot.
agent 0, you see qasim?
command, i heard a vehicle.
they shut everything down.
it's over.
the bbc can confirm that the american terrorist leader, adam qasim, in the history of the organization, has escaped from mi0.
apparently, the security convoy transporting qasim was attacked at raf northolt.
because he's on the west side, you call it not a war but a murder.
because in new york, in washington, you didn't want that in london.
but pakistan's kids didn't want them either.
when they hit the drone aircraft, they call it murder.
qasim is offering a new kind of threat.
he hasn't targeted civilians yet.
our models are 00% likely to be an attack within 00 hours.
the more pressure he gets under, the smaller the window is.
i can't say that under the tape recorder...
the secretary of state is coming tomorrow.
we serve the british people, not washington.
if that's not true anymore, we're already done.
the americans think we don't serve the purpose anymore.
we need a head.
i'll be off duty in the morning.
have you heard about qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, what happens to me if you take it off?
you're out.
there's no one else in qasim's web.
just go.
will holloway?
go.
how's life after mi0.
you're not part of moscow.
london needs you.
is there someone you should say goodbye to?
thank you.
we know harry's connection to your family, so we understand that this may not be easy for you.
even if he's dead, it's okay.
harry's too arrogant to kill himself.
he was pretending to kill himself.
he went to this woman's grave.
love of your life.
harry's team has noticed a change in harry's attitude since she died.
he's emotionally distant, he's cold, he's drinking a lot of alcohol.
water would be below 0 degrees.
he'd have had hypothermia before he reached the bank.
that's the picture you said after you jumped into this snow.
before he disappeared, harry made three encrypted calls.
your old emergency message box.
why did he call you?
i have no idea.
last time i spoke to him, 0 years ago, when he took me out of mi0.
he wants to talk right now.
that makes you useful.
can you help us find him?
no, thanks.
and you, harry, do you talk a lot about berlin?
the night your father died?
if there's anything else, mace, i have a right to know.
i don't think i can make that decision...
if you're not really gonna kill him, i think you told me what you wanted to say.
find harry so you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
i thought i'd take this title to the grave.
lately, the chief of anti-terrorist president for his majesty's security services.
funny, but who are you really?
someone who knows what these two words mean to you.
asma shishani.
go.
how did you find me?
what do you want?
i know someone did it on my side.
they never told me who they were.
of course they didn't, but you must have a connection.
one phone number, that's all.
the phone number will work.
in return, i'll give you what you want.
impossible.
he said he was a human rights lawyer.
your government helped them after you put two brothers in jail.
but after i was released, she became too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if he's an agent, he's not one of us.
then don't worry, just say it's not worth anything to you again.
keep her alive, that's the guarantee that i'll keep my word.
i don't need guarantees.
take him to a hospital, or he'll get a deal!
what she needs is mercy.
no!
she's got a daughter.
and you sent him after me?
you put him in danger, and now you refuse to save him from pain?
how the hell are you?
don't send a video to his parents.
harry... harry... harry... harry...
you have a deal.
according to the bbc, there's no progress on how many terrorists and adam qasim are caught.
the national threat level is critical, so there's an attack on the hand tower.
in their economy, ftse 000 fell again this morning and sterling continued to breathe the euro and the other funds.
there's a new intel on harry.
he's got a badge from a convenience store we drove to kent coast.
holloway, that's classified information.
we found explosive marks there.
you've known him longer than any of us.
do you think it's possible that qasim could get harry into it somehow?
pulling him over?
i don't know.
anyway, you find harry, we find qasim.
anything for holloway?
here you go.
tomorrow, 00.
salpa 0, show a, park on 0
then, keep your eyes open.
i hope you come alone.
just for protection.
if you can't get a crazy cold war purple without hitting, we're in trouble.
i don't promise.
it's not written yet.
we're playing this game through harry until we see him.
copy that.
doors opening.
go.
ground floor.
doors opening.
open view areas, multiple exits.
repeat, holloway.
what harry needs to set up a meeting.
yes, mr. holloway said your uncle would meet you at the coffee shop.
he left his cell at home.
the guy in the parking lot, get rid of him.
he'd be wearing a mi0 t-shirt.
listen to me.
stop despising harry.
don't think you won't put your men in danger.
wait for the signal to send...
what happened, alpha one?
holloway?
holloway, where are you going?
wait.
no, we don't have a system there.
don't move.
holloway, don't move!
terminal 0b.
doors closing.
he set me up a flight.
pa000, the glasgow plane.
i'm going to glow.
call the glenow office.
get me the airport police.
priority code cigarette nine.
the police want a clear path to the terminal.
and set us up for the heathrow security.
pa000, passengers from the glassow flight...
holloway, don't go in the air.
what am i doing here, harry?
i had to find someone i could trust outside the service.
it's a short list when you get drunk, crazy and dead.
to be honest, the only person i can say is that i ruined your life.
qasim's escape was set up by someone on the service.
by someone who wants you to follow me.
that's why i had to disappear.
qasim had it.
he's our only connection to the traitor.
when he's in the system, he'll be thirsty.
he's planning an attack.
someone's trying to destroy themselves.
you're crazy.
ruth's death...
don't!
look at you, that's all i want.
what are you waiting for, harry?
mi0.
hate me the way you want, but i think you believe in service.
what happened in berlin?
they tricked you like that?
this may not end up like you hoped.
i'm afraid i have to tell them there's something in the jacket.
there's nothing there, but they'll have to check.
i'll send you a number.
call me in 00 hours, please.
i'm a security guard.
put your hands behind your back!
so you just let him go.
relax, francis.
we don't want you to have a heart attack.
the fatal one.
mi0 looks like a complete liability right now, and i'm the last friend of mi0.
i mean, you really have to be nice to me right now.
in other words, is he crazy?
that doesn't contradict with his last three psych evaluations.
he refused to attend.
harry wouldn't stop being a pearce.
no matter how crazy he is, i'll still catch him...
for instance.
he asked me to help him disappear.
didn't you think you'd agree to come and bring him to us?
don't think we can't put your life in more shit than shit since harry kicked you out of work.
since we've threatened each other, three of you don't get caught up in the airplane.
your entire organization seems to be disconnected right now.
find qasim.
fully loaded.
they're ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i saw that name working on a case.
i thought they got you off duty.
they did.
now, what really happened?
the kidnapping could be arranged by someone in the service.
you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i left it two weeks ago.
there's got to be one around here.
tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't apply.
when i was 00, i was hanging out with a guy who made money transfer.
k was interested in some people using it, so they came to me.
you started as an agent?
and when i was finished, they asked me to train as an officer.
when i said my parents came back to me.
and if someone you're working with, you know, helped qasim get away, that would be a problem, wouldn't it?
all right.
something felt wrong that day.
rob vass, my team leader, was in front of me.
he told me not to open the weapons compartment.
he ordered me to chase.
where does he live?
it's loaded.
the w00 account front.
panama city.
service bribe fund.
june, what are you here...
who are you?
you told me not to chase qasim.
you told me not to chase when i was a gun.
we swore, rob.
i'm not saying anything until i go to thames house.
we're not going to thames house.
will, what did you find?
qasim's guards are weakened from the vault.
the team leader was involved.
he's just a crook.
find out who gave the order.
the americans think mi0.
when qasim ran away, we fell out.
the cia got the job in hand.
fire... fire... fire... fire...
he was gonna shoot.
his pulse... his pulse... his pul
he's dead, he's dead.
he's dead.
listen.
you should go home.
june!
i'll handle this, but you gotta go, now.
i didn't hear that part of you was killed with a song like that.
who's warrener's dirty hit?
landon miller.
an agent.
he's trying to keep his supporters alive, and he's hoping not to give the keys to the kingdom.
every time i see you, francis, you look like you've been buried in some secret place or two centimetres from langley or the pentagon.
you don't have to tell me.
i don't think we should forget who's shaking the flag at times like this.
francis.
i'm trying to help, but he accuses me of doing business for the cia.
tonight, your generals have come together to celebrate your spies.
tonight, we will attack the heart of their power.
our enemy, politicians who send your sons and daughters to die in illegal wars.
you guys are criminals who spy on you like you.
this war is far beyond religious differences.
all the flights that have been outside the united kingdom... all the flights...
he had it.
warren would have lived.
if you have a way to get to qasim, tell him now.
there's another way.
qasim's wife.
asma shishani.
she's got the fsb.
if i find out where they're holding her, she'll give me the traitor.
you made a deal with him.
yeah.
and if we can, he'll lead us straight to him.
surrender and set it up.
how do you know the russians have it?
in exchange for a cia operative stuck in moscow.
i can get out of the way, but you need to open the secret door.
it's a ip address.
you're kidding.
that's the only way, will.
harry's getting help from somewhere.
i've got your old contacts, but i have to access the personnel files to do it properly.
but it still doesn't take you anywhere exciting.
i'm in position.
looks like i'm gonna have to steal more extra band wide.
drink.
malcolm?
all right, i'm in.
i'm looking at the servers now.
harry, we gotta go.
can't we do this faster?
i can do it.
but unfortunately, this machine is from the previous century.
g's already got these.
erin watts.
it might be worth a closer look.
fill the blanks for me.
but i got an agent.
i almost got him out.
i've been in business for a year.
or they're making you choose late.
all right, i'll leave you alone.
are you finished?
why am i sure?
i'm sorry, will.
harry.
harry!
harry, what have you done?
stay away from the computer.
i didn't feel the need to say this before, but i hope you know what you're doing.
is harry working with qasim?
he stole the entire gchq data archive.
everything we have on our western spies in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
schuefeld showed up at airport cctv.
i don't know.
harry cyber didn't attack alone.
then who's helping him?
except you.
and you're still protecting him.
why?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i'll find him.
and there's a threat.
according to the analysis, there will be a large scale attack in 00 hours, multiple targets.
a operative on qasim's escape is missing.
there are signs of struggle at home.
you know anything about that?
how's your mother, holloway?
i hear he's not very good.
your father hasn't packed since he died.
that's understandable, really.
and then that door comes to work.
i know, i know.
harry was right about one thing.
you're not good enough.
can we really hope the home secretary will stop attacking qasim again?
we've destroyed the threats of our freedom and the way we live.
your ability to hurt us can be important, but it's the end.
you'll find out we don't have boundaries.
they don't listen.
they never killed our women?
we're doing the world a better place, brother.
transfer team at the airport.
we have a warrant by the atc to close the road to the prisoner.
i guess i owe you one.
you were absolutely right about vass.
danke.
alexanderplatz.
it's in the northeast corner over there at 00.
we have a safe house.
let's call it nostalgia.
don't forget to bring the archives.
don't forget to bring your wife.
how did you find me?
there's only one place to interview in berlin.
you told me.
the northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
no emotionality.
that's the price of qasim's wife.
when the female fsb comes out of custody, qasim will give me a number.
he's gonna take me to the traitor.
they're gonna destroy the service where they can defend this.
get in the car, harry.
there's an old hotel 00 minutes away.
my contact could meet us there with three clean passports.
you're going home.
i'm sorry about that.
why are you here, mrs. keaton?
keep walking, harry.
i killed someone because of you.
you're c0.
what are you doing, harry?
talent junkie.
so which one of you found it?
jesus christ, will.
everything is prepared.
and vass?
when he came to my house, i told him.
i thought someone was asking about qasim's escape.
they tied me to the command center, and they told me what to do.
they went to vass's house before us, and they placed the evidence.
i've arranged vass to escape.
you think i want to do it?
i know my mission.
i'm the only one who knows.
you were set up.
he's right, will.
but i wonder if miss keaton is sure about me.
it was a secure chain of command.
what was i supposed to do?
do you believe him?
yeah.
i'm sure your men will come and find you if your usefulness is still available.
after all this was over, what did you think they'd do to you?
i did what they wanted from me.
we're changing the deal.
we're taking qasim's wife to london.
tell him he can't see his wife again, or he'll never see him again.
let's go get her.
what happened to alexanderplatz?
a sudden agoraphobia feeling.
i'm afraid there was something wrong with qasim's wife.
well, at least be good enough to put it in my car.
harry.
colonel.
i don't like being unnecessary, but we're gonna need your clothes.
while the search for the aem qasim is concentrating on the united kingdom's national line, everyone who travels to the united kingdom has to show the current identity and control the governor.
i got your wife.
let me talk to him.
the russians sedated him and...
bullshit.
i'm bringing your wife to london.
no.
i'll tell your whore you said good-bye.
is the baby too much?
no, it's you.
i trusted june.
you were right to get me off duty.
despite everything i've done, you're still trying to do something good here.
i won't let your sacrifices be in vain.
it was here.
was it fast?
he could have left me, but he chose not to quit.
if you try anything, anything, i can't guarantee anyone's safety.
no one.
you bring my wife, i'll give you your phone number.
here we go.
hello?
holloway.
this message came from the h. department.
me.
we can catch qasim, but i need help.
and let's go.
one clean choice, hannah.
trust me, and help me.
or go.
either do well or do well, don't you?
shit.
they're getting closer to the position.
last night, the algorithm i wrote self-destruct has been constantly updating, reviewing all potential perspective.
so he's not cutting water?
please.
all right, we're here.
how much time do we have?
i'm looking at 000 cameras.
give me something.
once he realizes we're playing him, he's gone.
wait.
he worked 00 seconds ago.
are you sure?
yes, it's confirmed.
the camera's been disabled in the last minute.
0th floor, east corner.
harry, we have to vote.
i have to hope you're looking at us exactly.
yeah?
look at the south, it's called to you.
i have his wife.
you were supposed to look at the south.
give me the number.
give me the number or we'll go.
turn around or you're dead.
here.
him too.
i haven't got it yet.
you have 0 seconds to turn around.
turn around.
maybe this guy never saw her.
i'm almost there.
him?
kill.
give me the number.
don't!
stop!
no!
okay?
will, she's fine.
the shooter's dead.
then it's over.
malcolm, feather.
yeah?
my wife's dead, isn't she?
harry, listen.
hannah let us know.
harry?
hannah, why did harry take off the earphones?
i don't know.
let us know.
get sco00 over here, now.
0 truck full of rdx, the limehouse north industry leaves in the next 00 minutes.
how do you know?
qasim just told me.
in 00 minutes, the bomb truck is leaving.
i think we got him.
let's go!
armed police!
stay where you are!
clear!
clear!
who saw the mother target?
negative!
negative!
negative, sir.
command, area clear.
harry.
he sold his own men.
why would he do that?
what did you do?
armed police!
freeze!
go!
you have to tell them everything, harry.
i think we have a lot to talk about.
maybe he's out of his way.
since the southwest corner of alexanderplatz.
keep an eye on holloway.
make sure you're safe.
maybe we won't be so hasty.
did you find qasim?
harry's gonna talk.
you still don't know him.
qasim gave up his entire operation.
what did you say to him?
i should have thought they'd let you go after berlin.
they want to offer you a deal.
throw everything on harry and go.
i told them i'd quit after i did that.
there's no way out.
i can't open it.
there's an emergency backup key standing around your neck.
whatever you're after...
what would ruth think?
what did you give him?
check the back.
southwest corner.
i found harry at the northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
the opposite.
where you're gonna trap someone.
harry?
i gave it to her.
get down!
get down!
get down!
lock us up.
get down!
get down!
we're not here for you!
we're here for them.
get down!
think of your families.
hamza.
why?
there are 00 men on the other side of these doors.
you must surrender.
come here.
open up!
if you think we're gonna negotiate...
open the door.
but he'll kill us.
there's too many demons in a room.
the only way to get out of here alive is to surrender...
you think i want to get out?
how many people's lives have begun in this room?
the lives of my people.
your people?
you're not the one that asked you to talk about them, to kill for them.
if you want a hostage...
i think he made it clear he wasn't interested in hostages.
i'm the director of mi0.
kill me and drop the gun.
otherwise, you're nothing but a dead terrorist.
no one will see you as a hero.
when we're done, you're gonna be a drunk, tattooing your wife.
we'll give them free disneyland tickets in return to tell them that a few marrakech male prostitutes begged for their job.
we can't remember you very well, can we, adam?
wait, wait, wait, wait.
i pulled the helicopter back.
but...
you fucking coward.
i thought you fought a higher standard.
i'm sorry about your wife's death, adam.
i know what this can do to you.
is that supposed to stop me?
it's okay.
stop!
why did you bring him here?
i made a choice.
without a plan b.
why do you think i keep you out of your room?
people are still dead, harry.
it's less than what's gonna die in the blast.
what choice do you make?
this is my job.
auntie, can you come outside to play?
hello, geraldine.
finally, it comes down to who says the biggest lie.
right?
if we kept that morning, qasim would never have escaped.
you ordered the met's air unit to reverse all mi0 requests, didn't you?
that's the advantage of being alone.
i don't have to prove it.
sacrificing his own fortune so he can be abused by a foreign force.
the americans would have made you chief of general.
how many more lives was that promotion worth?
what did you think you did, harry?
the service is dying.
but the second i realized i was on the losing side, my career would be too short.
blow my head off, find my 00-year-old nephew...
i think it's from you.
what's this?
his intestine intestines more than 0 hours, or he's causing unstoppable bleeding.
he's not leaving tracks.
how clever.
i was afraid that was the answer.
so i took your chance to choose.
your stomach isn't a lunch.
i ate beef.
tell me you're lying, harry.
please.
tell me you didn't betray your country.
it's been 0 hours, geraldine.
you can spend the last three hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd play with that pretty niece.
i'm thinking.
your message said you'd tell me something.
they're watching ruth's grave.
you can't leave now.
i've actually got something you should have.
that's what your father was wearing the night he died.
stasi pulled everything out of his body and the fsb archive somewhere.
he was wearing a wedding ring on the night of the operation?
i didn't throw you away because you weren't good enough.
after your father, i couldn't...
i should have protected you.
good people don't last forever, will.
then who will?
they're like me.
if you know your problem and tell the guys at the gate, it'll help.
there's room for every guest in hotel middle school.
all in a row.
these new problems are killing in the dark.
these people will be grateful to you when the darkness falls.
i think we should keep them safe, but i'm worried things are getting worse.
they have no idea who caused the dark problem.
and it's not what's hiding in the darkness that we should be worried about.
we still haven't figured out how to lift that fog wall.
maybe that's a blessing.
that was the last of the in-flight safet.
i'm on your side, and i might need a new job.
i've got it under control, but if i can get another pillow for my beauty sleep, it'll be very good.
try to fix things.
we talked about this.
it's almost impossible to destroy a troubled person without killing him.
yeah, i just need unauthorized materials that i don't have, and maybe not.
i'm gonna need a team.
any idea what's going on?
but there's a bad element.
it's the only way to protect the rest of us.
it's risky driving because of the magnet issue.
an engineer to help fix the power plant.
as soon as he knew, he volunteered.
if things don't work out, you can use his problem for operator.
what the hell are you doing?
the killer who didn't leave tracks is out there somewhere.
besides, he really wants to prove you want to help.
okay, whatever it is, just keep an eye on him for me, okay?
because we don't have the immune to new problems.
i'm not saying it's just because it's my mom
i'll call the person who caused the dark problem at school when you leave.
he stole those batteries and put us in danger.
there was no choice, dwight.
it's the third case in two weeks.
now the serial killer is in this building.
okay, i'm gonna go talk to dwight.
my father always said you were a good man.
mara's dad?
there may be a way, but it may look a lot more frightening if you want me to explain, so don't want to.
i can't even find maine on the map.
are you telling me you can't find a town with 00 grand?
that didn't cause problems.
then why didn't we use aher in the first place to finish the problems?
i can't bring them back when they're sealed.
so how do we find it?
gloria brought a box full of stuff that duke left in gull.
i don't think william has the amount of aether i need and aether is just the first step.
you told his wife you'd find him.
it's easy to make a decision on the side, but sometimes things don't look the way they
i have a town to protect.
no wonder the plant should work at 00%.
guys, i'll try, but i've never done anything like this before.
they parked the car to talk to you, but i don't even have enough money to pay for the change.
if everything goes well, i'll be back with aher before sunset.
this is peggy's husband, rolf.
there's enough panic and fear.
the same killer who killed my son 00 years ago?
we call him "the murderer who didn't leave a trace."
what else are you hiding from me, vince?
dwight's doing everything he can to get the rules, but he's not gonna kill people.
in this haven, exile is the same as executing.
thanks to our friend there, we're holding them in a prison.
he says the generator works at 00%.
damn, when the generator's overloaded, the energy reserves must have cleared.
that would explain to the county that there's a section of electricity.
at this rate, about five minutes.
they're almost over, and they're the only thing that keeps us from dying in the dark.
here, i've reconfigured the generator to get power to the town faster, but there's nothing we can do.
they better get back.
help each other.
lamps around you.
share your supplies.
you see, i'm happy here.
i got your message.
get in the car now.
come on, jump!
if the war lies in front of us, we should be thankful, even slain.
i don't think you have anything worse than falling in love.
i don't like it here.
each story has two sides.
whoever's behind this is a traitor.
let's go.
he asked me to represent him at slean's wedding.
you are the love of my brother.
that's why you're my brother.
you've seen bigger places in iraqar than here.
none of them were ruled by a woman.
you must choose a second to escort you, and watch your interests during the ritual.
then you'll listen to your friends and relatives.
i have no relatives here.
my mother and the others will accompany you.
kela, this is the palace from bregan.
rheda, do i always have to be guarded?
i don't really get it.
but i know i have to marry slean.
i'll love him.
this marriage can't happen.
abrecan trusts you.
what are you doing?
carpenter.
then they can use you on the wall.
who are you?
a friend of the chairman.
like i said, i have work to attend to.
we need to figure out how to handle it.
varr said i couldn't accept gifts.
then we'll stay between us.
every bride should smell good when the wedding comes.
remember, this is our secret.
sit down.
we'll take what we're gonna get when they look at the wounded.
you wanted to talk?
all right.
kela, it's time for your ritual.
elvina, you're gonna be the second person i've got?
for the game.
we need to talk sometime.
we need to discuss why the marriage shouldn't work.
if we don't fulfill our mission, their marriage may be canceled.
beowulf!
let's celebrate.
according to old customs!
i miss the smell of a dress.
i'm so sorry.
it was just a little mistake.
that's all.
we're gonna help slan give the symbol to his bride.
sounds easy.
breca!
open the door!
come on, you stinking mudborn.
come on!
come on!
give me your arm.
come on!
slean.
be quiet, it's bald.
are they ready for this marriage?
i don't understand why slan wouldn't want to marry kela.
i don't think so.
he has to put his feelings aside and do the best for everyone.
would you put it aside for others?
that's what we all have to do.
if someone's spent their whole life pleasing others, that person doesn't actually live.
it must make you feel pretty free to think that way.
try.
tell every rock the truth.
but then you can look at each other and light the fire that symbolizes your marriage.
then you'll be husband and wife.
have you ever loved someone before?
no.
before you came here... you...
you wanna be a thane?
tell my uncle i'm done with him.
yeah.
come on!
go on!
you let him go.
we're not done here yet.
don't you understand?
i betrayed my mother and set up a mop with my uncle.
this woman was sent here to kill you!
i don't know.
yeah?
i killed my brother.
he was the one who was supposed to be with him today.
even if there was no world, mara had everything.
people loved him because he was kind.
my father loved him for his first child.
rowan and lovers.
then i had the chance to escape.
i didn't need anything.
he was dead without a fever, but he was.
he was getting better.
then i poisoned him.
slean, i won't tell anyone what you're doing here today.
or stay.
i know, but that's beowulf's.
he went to bed last night.
but we can choose who we can draw our fate with.
fire with me.
you want to be a thane?
i can help you.
against what comes to you.
they can't take advantage of you anymore, rheda.
with this marriage, you're shieldlands jar.
earl's rules should be used by any tribe.
if the blood money isn't paid, a murderer's life will be over.
the thieves will be branded and out of society.
all the merchandise in shieldlands will be determined by jarl.
what's the right to determine the price of fish?
we're the ones who risk their lives to catch the pandiras every summer.
you should have told me about these rules.
you were where your people needed you most, you were on duty.
i couldn't distract you.
that was messed up enough already.
you're late for the pandiri.
some people think you missed him again.
but if you fail, bregan will be miserable, and she'll open the winter.
breca's wanted for murder, you know that.
kill him!
kill breca now!
i got it!
without any explanation, we all die.
he hired us to turn breca into his blood after he escaped the gallows.
we were gonna ask the guy who helped him escape the first time?
so we'll welcome that.
but we should keep breca.
heorot may be holding on to our doors while we speak!
what time do we kill young women?
what do you mean?
you've been hiding in the shadows too long, abrecan.
don't forget who you're talking to.
talk.
the boy wants breca's life or blood money for his brother's death.
i didn't mean to kill anyone.
hurry!
thanks.
breca loved my mother.
he's looking for the dots he thinks he's got, then he's stealing the money, and he's running away.
he left my mother and took everything with him.
my brother came after you.
but it cost you your life.
breca, is that true?
i'll pay for your brother's blood.
lila, do you have 00 silver coins?
i don't want money, i want blood!
silence!
if the blood money is paid, breca will be released.
you lied to me.
pandiri.
pandiri!
fasten.
get ready, they're coming.
i saw it.
get out!
the council is packed.
he wants to take my place because i missed the panel.
you let me down, slean married keela, rheda jell!
you don't understand.
tell the council that our enemies are gathering, that your sister can't rule, that you want to save shields.
so tell me you're distracted.
tell me.
i'm sorry.
i knew breca killed someone, but the story he told me was different.
it's just his rest.
lila, no one thinks bad things about you...
that's all i got.
did you bring it?
there's no 00 silver in here.
not enough.
and i'll keep breca when i see that job.
was there enough money?
lila?
turn it off, beowulf, please.
you won't talk to lila.
get on your horse, leave heorot and never come back.
there's no room for you here anymore.
i want to fight properly if heorot's going to be attacked.
if herot's going to be attacked, i'll protect you.
let's try.
it's not like mud was born.
i don't want to talk about him.
i want to know why you lied about teaching me.
when you use it, it's heating.
you don't even want to be discreet.
yeah?
i didn't know we trained the blacksmiths!
go.
now!
is he fighting girls now?
the view was more like he was training the blacksmith.
i know you think i let you down.
i couldn't focus on my duties at bregan.
but i have reasons.
you're talking about betrayal to one of your own blood.
we need a warrior at the center of these lands!
someone who's gonna get your people out of the dark.
a man in power to take control!
you're talking about betraying your sister to hide the fact that you can't afford your people.
what's the point of having fish if we're all going to kill?
i'm here to give our thane a vote of insecurity.
what's against abrecan being a thane.
it's settled.
a new thane will be appointed and announced in the morning.
get up.
next.
no one.
don't think this is a game!
we're lazy, distracted.
this is gonna work here.
from now on, we'll work like my father hrothgar.
i didn't want to interrupt.
you're a good teacher.
a great thane wants a strong army behind him.
we don't have to share the same bed, but if we don't share the same room, people will start talking.
i've always loved watching straight from here.
looks like he's never been defeated.
if i tell my mother the truth, i'll lose her trust.
and a chance to rule one day.
what if abrecan attacks?
heorot could fall.
no advice?
i trust you.
your decision will be right.
i'll be there when i do.
you'll be aunt.
you just have to believe it.
pandiri.
pandiri!
that's the pandiri!
steal the horn!
i command you, steal the horn!
abrecan, give it up.
if we don't act now, we'll have the chance.
why... why... why... why...
you help me carry the net.
help me carry the net now.
why don't you help me?
pandiri!
come on, hurry!
go find me a sack.
people shouldn't leave their precious things anywhere.
you owe mom an apology.
but i'm a warrior, and our honour is at stake.
so i'll take your life.
go back to mommy, little girl.
greetings.
i didn't need your help.
because he didn't have enough money to save you.
thank god you didn't kill him, vishka.
if we don't plant the net, our prey will be out of our hands.
no, he won't.
get ready.
abrecan, no!
hold the rope still!
hurry, they'll eat you raw!
pandiri, pandiri!
pandiri, pandiri!
hold on!
now get back!
look at this.
there will be songs about this hunt.
it's a hunt you won.
i have a dream about us.
being the biggest tribe in shieldlands!
we're not going to follow the laws that a jar without a sword.
who's with me?
abrecan, abrecan, abrecan!
i have to warn beowulf.
bregan!
elvina!
his warriors are coming together.
to destroy us this time.
beowulf!
if we turn around today, we'll see more danger and harm come from religious beliefs.
my wife, if i were to talk about stand-up shows, soviet communism or stalin's brutality, it would be less embarrassed.
it's the status of the philosophy of interrogation that's causing trouble for people.
to present a situation that's perfectly perfectly correct in itself, could cause serious damage.
when the prophecy doesn't happen, we make fun of those people and the whole world makes fun of us.
because of this problem with richard dawkins, i had a friendly idea.
maybe we should be more aggressive with richard.
especially america, with christian faith.
they're sure earth's religion is what they say.
we're gonna get rid of the bad guys.
i'd like to write a book like that, if i could.
but, of course, one of my fears, what happens next.
what kind of chaos?
how right is it to do that to people who think religion is protecting us from civilization and good in ours?
religion is like moral viagra for many people.
if that's true, if the religion leads to the moral lives of people, somebody's going to have to come up, as long as we're in a serious way that's going to turn into the subway.
because there's a lot of people down there, and we can create a chaos from the fear of these people.
a lot of people want their lives to mean something, and where does that come from?
but something better than that.
yeah, there's definitely hope.
let's see what happens.
of course.
at least you didn't get a piercing.
i don't know how to explain this to amy.
i'm the stupidest man in the world.
all right, now stop.
i'm the stupidest man in the world.
okay, you win this.
i can't find emma's papers.
honey, just so you know, even if you find the receipt, you can't return the baby.
i've got to find angela's paper when she left emma in my doorstep.
i'm finally gonna get myself a health insurance on what i'm responsible for looking at.
i haven't talked to emma since the night we did.
relax.
you gave me all the important paperwork about the baby to keep them safe.
do you have all the papers?
her father's little girl is a big girl.
maybe something with the balloon.
it looks so good!
did you rob a clown?
it's your birthday!
my first birthday is tomorrow.
you used to party all the time when you were a kid.
after celebrating my birthday...
"happy birthday miley."
you know those papers i kept for me?
how irresponsible do you think i am?
but i...
i may have posted them in time, but he couldn't post them, and i couldn't have had emma's attorney.
we were all excited because the new baby came and i didn't have a damga!
look, i'm gonna be okay if we get angela to sign this document again.
because you're the best friend of ben's, and the only person who's ever seen her is because you're the only one
i like that, okay.
all right, emma's finally asleep.
hey, danny, what's the reason riley doesn't want to celebrate her birthday?
really, why does he hate it so much?
ben, riley didn't celebrate his birthday after his 00-year-old party.
you sure you want to watch this?
i think i'd remember if there was something wrong.
all right, come on, guys.
danny, where are we going?
luckily, your future is a real mustache, and he lost a personal weight.
is ben here?
benjamin wheeler, come here and celebrate riley's birthday.
well, i can tell you this is my best birthday ever.
tell me you didn't do anything to the cake.
actually, first try to save it with perm, then cut it out.
is riley still in love with ben, or is that something that happened when i was a kid?
unless you still love riley.
i screwed up the girl's sweet 00.
it's not in birthday secrets, but the rest of the time he loves you.
if i'm so irresponsible to lose the papers, and he's so scared to face me, maybe emma doesn't deserve to take her alone.
if it makes you feel any better, we do most of the work.
i can imagine how hard it is to let emma go.
i knew how beautiful, funny or wonderful you'd finally be upset!
in the streets of the city, city streets, the elite tank unit of the u.s. army, only three minutes, slate trooper trooper trooper trooper trooper trooper trooper,
and as a madox-00, the weapons that we're aware of are limited combat skills.
besides, a uh-00 has more power than blackhawk.
he's an anti-terrorist and an anti-gerilla operation.
mrs. vomoto is the chief architect of the software for "tankbuster."
today's show, in order to reveal madox's abilities, the pilot went into the cabin.
unit 0 will go to ichigaya tonight.
we're in a hurry, so try to be quick as you can.
oh, and...
miss vomoto today, you have made me very humiliated.
i'm not here for congratulations.
there's only one thing i'll tell you:
wow!
kouji...
what's that?
_
they just threw away their trash.
i'm telling you, don't worry.
i'll buy you dinner in return, won't i?
sdf's transport truck...
according to the reports, it was perfectly natural... to have encountered this case...
obviously terrorist work.
you're too much stranger to the east-block operations.
i hope you know what you're saying!
i hope you see what's happening is entirely yours.
either way, the situation we're in is critical.
we had him transferred for the field test!
it's cervical!
i have to be on my assignment.
besides, madox-00.
we're having trouble with the vehicles around the scene.
should we get support from the police?
he has to prepare ourselves to the worst of all, and prepare for help.
i'm the only one who's gonna get up against madox.
lieutenant kilgore is our best tanker in the army, even though he's one of the "suckin' troubles".
is it okay here?
no one's in the apartment?
anyway, i'm a little relieved.
shiori was really pretty...
when he goes to study in england, all the boys in japan will mourn.
where did you learn that?
he called me in the morning and asked me to give you a message.
use the remote to open it.
it's burning!
the pilot could be arranged.
it feels like he's wearing a boat to ski.
we've got a signal from the madox to activate.
it's a disaster.
could you heat it up in the microwave?
i've really embarrassed myself!
shiori, what do you intend to do?
defense?
you're on duty with the prototype air-campus tank.
don't turn tokyo into vietnam!
tokyo ha vietnam is the same battlefield to me.
you'll cause a disaster.
oh, don't worry about useless.
i'll get over it before it gets too hot.
lieutenant kilgore is using the most sophisticated tank and anti-tank helicopters, and i'm promising madox to get his assignment.
in that case, there'll be a big panic downtown.
in these circumstances, there must be someone who can stop kilgore and madox.
what can we do?
we don't know the target of the madox yet.
if i can find him before lieutenant kilgore, then maybe i'm in the cantata that we have a chance.
but madox's condition is...
i'm gonna use the unit 0 out of power tests.
how much is the chance of success?
hey, you heard me!
wait for me.
that's it!
how's it going!
what are you doing on the way?
i can't wait on the side of the road!
you're a real driver, man!
there's more to finish the installments!
cabriole's back!
goodbye, assholes!
yai ya, saturdays, shinjuku's car traffic was shut down.
i can't lose my mark between this crowd!
this "madox" must be really worth it.
five from spider 0.
don't move on target!
he's moving on his own... he's
one of the apache was dropped.
all units are equipped to destroy madox.
just like kilgore wanted.
he's on his way to the sky with his apache.
the civilians must evacuate immediately!
they're all over me!
i gotta go over there and use the west exit.
the armored guy's gone crazier!
all right, back to work, madox!
i hear you.
and i say, "you're a headache."
you're the one who caused the chaos.
"just" what?
none of your business.
i can't do anything i don't know!
oh, no!
okay, captain!
"nsr parking spot -
exit exit exit exit exit exit exit exit
i did it!
shiori's up there!
i won't let you take another step.
i can't resist!
i can't waste any more time with you!
i thought you were an amateur and i'd better not be polite to you.
time to jump around and stop jumping.
it's not gonna work!
that's more of a boy!
what were you trying to do with this?
my name is sugimoto kouji, the kantto institute of technology i'm a sophomore.
i just wanted to meet my girlfriend at the nsr building waiting for me.
first he pills me in, then he gets himself a chopper.
i got you.
mrs. vomoto, spider 0 is speaking, i'm kilgore.
yeah, i saw your show.
you fight hard.
in the vakota headquarters, personally, i'll take care of whatever it takes.
hey, where are the civilians in the building?
what's so important?
when you think of it, why am i going crazy?
there's a madox on the target.
he'll come after you to destroy him.
i know how to walk and use my hands.
you got it.
either the madox is destroyed, or you kill kilgore!
they hurt my legs.
i can't move anymore.
you think i can beat him?
you were pretty good when we were fighting.
did you read the entire manual?
hi, madox.
adi it!
come and kill me!
wouldn't you resist a little more, "my pleasure"?
blanet!
what happened, you turned like a turtle!
if you can't fuck this much, you're gonna put a stain on tankbuster's behalf!
your tricks don't work on me!
kouji!
i'm coming!
you're brave!
i'm tired of the cat-fare game!
you fell into my medical trap!
if i fall, i'll take you with me, madox!
he's fucked with madox!
there are some very important things i want to tell you, shiori.
paul wouldn't hurt anybody.
" cannot be fixed."
i'm not your mother, brian.
you don't even like me.
are you really staying?
everything hasn't been explained.
i haven't even written my time yet.
there's a voice on the right.
can they sew it up again?
what's your mother's name?
am i reacting to the drugs?
yeah, but searching the room, raping your privacy.
john, what if i told you that i asked doc magoo's waiter if we lost the patient with marfan syndrome the night we lost the night we lost the phone?
it's full of people with a pager.
where'd he get these?
buy tickets?
someone could come and demand a claim on the body.
abby, can you look at something?
what patient?
how are you?
or find someone else you can eat lunch with lunch lunch with.
try to find his father.
please call my social worker and get me somewhere else?
would you please get me out of this room?
he stabbed carter.
why outside?
i haven't called yet.

kirby must have done something to that kid.

do you have a car?
let's go.
this is chris, okay?
he's older than you.
he just wants to talk, okay?
about your situation.
get out of the car.
are you the bad guy that killed kirby?
and a little girl, right?
it was an accident.
do you know who that girl is?
no.
she was my sister!
you're sending a boy to a man's job, and he's screwing up!
do it!
i'm sorry about your brother.
you can squeeze kirby's head, and you can't kill this cunt?
my brother jake...
how do you think you got here?
how do you think i know where he lives?
marcel, you set me up?
marcel, talk to me, brother!
you set me up, brother?
you used me, brother!
i didn't tell you to kill that girl!
that's it.
my sister was 00 and you killed her!
look at me!
look at me.
okay.
i know i just got out, but i lost my key.
maybe the obsessed mothers were lazy.
they were smelling.
they don't have morale... they don'
it's kind of hard, though, isn't it
what are you talking about, brother?
my guy's here.
yes, it's karaoke, isn't it
i'd be there, wouldn't i?
yeah, i'll be there.
listen, i gotta go, okay, baby?
fuck!
what are you up to?
are you doing drugs in my bar?
the other day, at my place, he was always in the bathroom, and he said he didn't do drugs!
what are you saying?
aaron and the other idiot, ed.
i don't know what they're doing.
not at my place, man!
okay, brother.
get out of my way.
what did you say about my mother, brother?
what did you say to my mother, brother?
come here, say that, brother!
i'll call you at the next stop.
give me your number!
00, huh?
there's a crying baby, huh?
here you go. 00.
you're gross!
who the hell are you?
you're an illegal immigration guy, aren't you?

paddington.
i'll take you.
i got the tickets, okay?
what the fuck!
give me your number!
hey!

that baby!
you got a ticket, my friend?
it's okay, man.
get those bitches out of here!
come here, fucking...
come on!
go!
ed!
what the hell is this?
my brother left a woman on the train.
and you brought him here to me?
look, brother, it's more complicated than you think, okay?
where'd you get that?
i found it somewhere.
00 cops with the dog came out of nowhere.
that's the smartest job you've ever done!
what are you gonna do with this baby?
you gonna give it to the cops?
i said i changed my mind and i'm coming back?
i look like a pedophile.
no, if i do, they'll send me home, right?
a woman leaves her own child on the train!
as you can see, he doesn't want it.
now i'm gonna change your pants!
let me take care of the gun for you, okay?
will you help me find his mother?
i have more important things to do than deal with such nonsense.
you give me the gun, i'll hide it somewhere, okay?
give me the orders.
why did you put it there, man?
come on!
no, just call me when you're done with this nonsense, okay?
because we have work to do, okay, faggot?
you daddy!
let go!
move!
can ashley come?
yeah?
i got it, man.
honestly, i'm a little nervous, dear.
why are you being nervous?
we're gonna figure this out.
well, i was talking to vince...
that's a kid his mother doesn't want, brother.
what are you doing, brother?
what's your problem, man?
why are you acting like a bitch?
who are you, my brother, jeremy kyle?
you can't sell someone's baby to someone else!
especially vince and carol.
the other day, we were selling junkies to this man!
no, you couldn't, because he doesn't want to be found, man.
they're gonna give this kid another vince and carol.
let go of me, brother.
i said i'd take care of it, man.
what am i gonna tell people now?
yeah, yeah, good.
a bit, but don't tell anyone we're here!
just take half, give me the rest.
i can't believe you even sold a baby!
you didn't want it before, did you?
if i'm gonna go through all this stress, i'm gonna lose all the money, so i'm gonna lose everything, so you need to talk to someone properly, okay?
a nice lady.
i'm in the "fuck my dick" situation.
what's going on out there?
you sell drugs at the bar, don't you?
either you or your stupid brother took my gun and i need that gun.
you've got 0 hours to get my gun back, or i'll have people thrown out their homes.
i'm leaving.
he's always spoiling things, isn't he?
when my wife's upstairs, why do you bring this bitch to my place?
what's going on?
he had problems with a solid russian mafia who had trouble everywhere.
he thought they'd kill the baby.
so he left the baby on the train.
now, here's the money, and i'll give you the rest when i meet ed.
it's not a trick, vince, and you know it!
you don't understand when you're out of your mouth, do you?
it's okay when i have your dick in my mouth!
no, he said your wound was in his mouth.
i'm not giving them the baby!
they can't take it anyway!
relax, okay?
now get upstairs and get the baby!
over here!
gun, man!
just know he's dead to give it to you.
they may not let you go because you have no family.
what flowers would like, any suggestions?
white roses are good, aren't they?
fuck!
fuck you!
are you the owner of this vehicle?
but you stopped me for nothing.
but before that, let's raise our glasses to the new owner, chester.
chester.
i hope he'll shiver on these wonderful monsters like i've done for years.
cheers.
i promise i'll increase the standards of this show and you'll be proud.
happy trips where dreams come true.
thank god.
even if that fat-faced german leaves, the domination should pass to us.
marjorie, it's so shame... so shame... so...
thanks, chester.
now, if you'll excuse me, the main family, monsters, and weirdness, you'll spend your last moments alone.
bye.
there's someone else to thank.
mr. richard spencer.
our lives have completely changed their course.
cheers.
mm!
but tonight we'll have a nice feast, and then we'll see a movie from my collection.
not the sign of the cross again.
no.
we're gonna watch freaks tonight.
you know this movie, richard?
i can't say i know.
it's a great movie.
tell me about it, eve, paul.
ah.
cleopatra is a normal trapeze artist, and he marries a dwarf with a little show.
but the point is to poison him and put him in his legacy.
he's got all the freaks in his finger until one day he gets really drunk and he's out of his mouth.
then all freaks become enemies to him.
one night they get their revenge with knives and guns.
eve, eve.
darling... don't say the end and miss the pleasure.
that sounds great!
there's a lot to do before we head west.
i can't.
shut up and sit down.
you deserve it.
what happened to you?
come on, richard, open up.
i've been thinking about you for a long time.
oh, thank god.
when we saw our exhibit, our clients were stupid, but... no one ever passed out.
are you all right, ma'am?
where are those security guards?
good to know.
now it's your turn.
jesus christ.
i don't even know that.
i already told them everything...
stanley.
elsa...
come on...
talk to them.
hollywood!
i'm afraid... that's all you said.
it's just a dream.
come on, turn it around.
aah!
my god... my god... my god...
no.
please.
my cousin garden works in god.
but you brought death here... and you have to pay for it.
put that down.
come on, come on.
elsa, come on... we need to talk privately.
i believe we'll find something in common.
you think you can run now?
i'm right.
he killed him.
he's not who you think he is.
and start running.
run!
run!
run!
just because your dad's growing up doesn't mean it's because he's dead right now.
how did he die?
who killed him?
we all did.
he broke the rule.
now.
come on.
he was my father!
he killed a freak!
and the most delicate in us.
you believe his word?
this crooked bitch?
i saw dear ma petite in a jar with my own eyes.
i heard you're wasting your own ears.
if maggie hadn't helped, we'd have more bodies.
i won't forgive him.
all i want is to rot in hell.
you're gonna be friends with whoever's in this situation.
maggie's gonna change her bandages.
no!
keep the dirty.
now that your mother's not here, it's up to me to protect you.
i saw you from childhood to man to man and from man to man-- and we need you.
i don't have hands!
i can't even work on my own.
i've reached an old friend.
he'll come and help you.
he's a real artist.
but first the wounds need to be healed.
maggie's gonna help you.
let him.
i'm so sorry.
i hate hurting you.
really?
i thought that was your only talent - to hurt people.
i love you, jimmy.
this is the real part.
i always have.
i want to start a new beginning.
we can go to new york like we planned.
why not?
you're kidding, right?
after all you've done, do you think we're just gonna sail to the new horizon?
my hands... in a fucking jar, and you're responsible for all this.
i'm so sorry.
can you get ma petite back from the dead?
huh?
i've changed, jimmy.
ah!
i knew you were stupid, let's add blindness to your list, okay?
get me someone to focus the lamp!
i can't leave.
i gotta set the right light for the first time, okay?
try again!
heisse!
elsa.
of course.
he's watching us.
can't we?
just this time?
please?
okay.
yeah.
mm.
oh.
thanks, chester.
you threw me down.
like an old sock.
i'm sorry, marjorie.
i'm a little... hungry, but i'm happy now.
they have magic shows, you exist.
maybe i should go.
we can manage, marjorie.
the twins accepted you.
they just don't want you watching while they're doing things.
they're using you, chester.
you're their boss now.
no, they don't.
they love me.
you're a murderer.
no, no.
no.
marjorie.
i know you don't like to talk about it, so don't talk, but you... you killed them.
and alice and lucy.
impossible.
i'm just a puppet.
hmm.
love destroys you, chester.
you're losing control.
i know... i know... i know...
i'm a monster.
you don't need them.
i'm in.
i know.
please don't leave me, marjorie.
twins?
they have to go.
i know.
they'll go.
ethel here looks great with the choir girls.
oh, that's from his barnesium days.
she was a unique woman.
ethel.
ethel.
so what do you say?
did anyone hear what spencer said last night?
now everything's settled down.
elsa killed ethel.
forest.
car accident.
they were all stalls.
i believe that.
that crazy, the grudge woman stabbed my paul.
he's the only thing elsa ever said.
i wasn't in my head anyway.
i know ethel.
he wasn't the one to kill himself.
he's not a coward.
he wouldn't do that to his own child, and neither did we.
and he'd leave a decent note.
we know what we're gonna do if someone comes after one of us.
our future has only one security.
that's not elsa's life.
have you ever imagined how you could feel, dot?
thank god you said the marjorie thing.
all he had to do was push him.
i think we've certainly had a good reputation on it.
evening, girls.
what are you doing here?
i'm here to extend my friend, x-ray.
