michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, her brother, buster, who shared her bed.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i will.
i have to write a trial of at least 000 words about the morality of war and the possibility of a conflict.
i'm not sure our ethical teacher would like me to cheat while writing a trial.
so, you passed my ethics test.
actually, it was desperate, desperate, desperate for her teacher at sergegemichael bethbauerly.
even the hands of people who commit small crimes can be severely cut.
no ring ring ring no ring ring no ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
the s.d.k.'s eye was on us.
your father thought it would make us look better.
he must have faked my signature.
'maybe a year ago, i'll have a son who finished the soy cheese!
you gotta get me out of this.
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't look at her either.
i don't have a mother's kindness and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yes.
by the way, when did you sleep with anyone?
meanwhile, lindsay was giving george michael her homework.
why do i tell you this?
i guess there are some things you can't tell your father about.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to arrange his teacher for her father... to make her mother's job.
there's nothing wrong with that.
however, since you don't think about me for that, i must say i'm a little broken.
the stills can do that.
and the teachers can perform it.
surely, someday, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i find it, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay was never so proud of what she said her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i've been telling you about.
she is, really... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
you have a moustache.
i mean, the moustache has milk on it.
yeah.
but gob misunderstands the sentimentality of michael's kindness... and feels he's competition to interfere.
because, you know, beyond adorable... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
is it really, michael, shannon?
and there was a surprise visit to george sr.
i read all your teachings and took all your tapes.
and i watched it all over again.
george s.r. recently offered a series of suggestions... to make money from the spiritual spirit that he'd recently discovered.
i also lost two pounds of your banana bluth jail bars.
i came to find out at your place.
this is a good place to start.
and after michael got rid of the two girls he had an appointment with, he met lindsay at the parent-teacher night.
hey, linds, is this my imaginary product... or does this place have the same plan as our kitchen floor?
i think she's very suitable for you.
i used to think it would make her think that it was a motherhood.
besides, i can't rush into something like this just because my son wants me to, and marry somebody.
i'm miss baerly, the ethics teacher.
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life that could have been destroyed without a thoughtful trigger.
and michael started to recognize his son's ethics teacher.
that's the "rrrrr" thing.
you know, so annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were kidding.
no, i was just laughing because you were laughing.
"rrrr!" - "rrrr!"
but, you know, - - - - - - - - - -
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite something to drink?
or... or... or... or... or
yes, he is.
i think that mr. daniels was having a stroke...
let's go get a drink.
yeah, maybe it'll help.
george soc was dealing with his own fan.
i've already told you a lot of my sin.
maybe you can tell me some of your sins.
well, there are legal symptoms showing my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me one of those things about... one of the things that happened in the college bedroom again.
and what did michael have today's second date on his date with miss bayerly...
michael, this little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it's him.
you have to rob her to freeze her for sure.
yes, mother.
they'll take her back.
don't take your shoes off, little master!
don't take your shoes off!
he's out of control.
who is it?
this is annyong, your father and i adopted it.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you and a new son are you?
lucille figured buster was worried, even jealous.
and he understood how it felt to be ignored.
annyyong is now your sister's sister annyyong
abort.
he's staying.
listen, i'll call you sonar again.
nice ride.
you making reservations for dinner?
he made a korean.
and after their meeting..
michael took a step he hadn't taken in years.
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we sneak in without waking everyone up?
this may not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i love.
so i took someone you love.
i said "nashbagerblairjam."
listen, i know you're trying to get back at me for the whole marta thing.
i was lying to you when i told you i wasn't going to try to get him to sleep, so...
he has to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i'm lucky i got rid of him.
no problem.
so romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i have to say i don't know it was real first.
but now... your moral teacher...
yeah, i did it for her.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm pretty sure you're interested in him for the point.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
is this about the lesson?
i mean, she loves him my loyalty...
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with her.
well, why did he do that?
why did he sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new...
he's not one of the good snipers targeting his target, and he's almost anywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think that he was...?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think she's old?
we don't even know how old she is.
no one knows.
she was having a little girl at different dances... and i was thinking about going to her, messing around with her, doing something...
"hey, you wanna dance?"
and i thought he was gonna say, "what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it differently across the mirror, but...
but, you know, it was, like, we were dancing with a joke or something.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should go out with someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've identified a difficult book to find a picture of saddam frustration in the bathroom suite.
"what would sadame do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's the same as our fire escape.
in prison, george sr was preparing for the evening of his most loyal fan.
when cindi lightballoon makes her own arrangements.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and when george michael was still angry at gob... he called the family expert on making trouble.
i know you went out with shannon.
that cheerleader?
yeah, he'll probably take her to one of those stupid different dances.
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr daniels... and i asked him... but he breathed and dropped the phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe i should go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hello.
my mother took him.
he's got me registered to do school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the situation with miss bearly and george michael.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality...
you see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's like she's in love with you, so...
he knows we're out.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most immoral thing i've ever heard.
well, you're only a half- semester teacher.
look, that was a preemptive move.
my brother was going to try to sleep with you.
so, i want to leave you at this exact moment and i'm not coming back to you.
i see.
from now on.
she went for a walk with george sr. cindi.
george.
and she's getting to know him.
you can totally spill your heart at me here.
it weighs on my soul.
you...
he's blowing the camera.
i'm taking you to the granyong dance, so this is your dinner, so it's away with my mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy.
watch your back, my immigration little brother!
and the different spring dance was at the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you don't let her in just because she doesn't have the perfect flaw of a perfectly flaw like you, the eyes of the apartment, the strong square-shaped jaw.
you wanna dance?
all right!
gob finally found shannon he was looking for...
gob found out he was cheating on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
sorry.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i messed up our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about it for a long time, and...
that's... that's your right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing at a high school dance?
i'm only here with my girlfriend.
yes, with my ethical teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
i'm really touched that you're trying to protect me after being so mean to you.
actually, gob mistook michael's morality teacher for citizenship.
man, he... he understands the type.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a citizenship teacher.
second move.
i was seeing mrs. baerly, and i never should have dragged gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never wanted to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laugh on some sad things, but...
i don't think we'll have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm getting this cake.
hey, you want to dance?
i can't believe this is working.
the next one's at development.
buster's pull is toast.
stop, stop, stop, stop!
there are no candles here.
mom's going crazy.
no, it's okay.
i light my candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
no problem.
right here, let me help you.
these?
okay, here, let me carry it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is something really extreme.
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we'll all go one day, right?
four months ago, each of you joined an interview, to attend an untold tv show.
and guess what?
you won.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm such a gay man and i'm proud of it.
you're adorable, aren't you?
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel from england.
me too.
that's my brother stanton, my parole officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him in the head.
she doesn't know.
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they look like barack obama these days.
each of you will earn $00,000, all you have to do is spend a night in this prison.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
fuck!
cool.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know if this is a prank?
right.
it's our third show, but we're not gonna publish until the fall.
to find out if this is a prank, you're gonna have to play the game and earn the money.
you will be asked to perform a series of missions.
the missions will force your limits, your courage and thought.
that sounds fun, right?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make up your mind now.
i'm in.
where am i signing?
i didn't have a girlfriend to admit it when she was high.
i need to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you're crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
go around.
you'll notice.
the sum of money equally in between the survivors, but if you all take the night off, there's a rich prize.
no money can keep me here for the night.
anyone else want to join her?
not me.
there's no way i'm going to the city with this pissy boy.
i'm in.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you guys are idiots.
it's a fucking party joke, they're all gonna fuck with you.
you're nothing but a bunch of idiots.
can't you see this is a recording party?
or we'll be famous.
there's a human head there!
don't worry, it's not real.
looks pretty real to me.
that's why they call our business special effects.
pretty cool, isn't it?
a little sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thanks to our reward special effects team.
follow me, fellas.
in hot swamp water, lazy crocodiles are waiting for their prey.
the indian crocodiles become long and benevolent.
such crocodiles...
guys.
i see you work as hard as always.
are we ready?
we're all set.
and absolutely.
keep it that way.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great that you scared them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are gonna go to the show.
you really looked like you were scared.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really gives me the creeps.
did you know that?
the dead homeless?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
that must be a big coincidence.
you really think it's safe there?
safe enough for the show insurance.
any more questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're recording.
each of you was chosen by your own free will, spent the night in jail, making $00,000 a head.
clear enough, isn't it?
okay, let's get this party started.
you can find anything you need at your base camp, that's the manager's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you've got all the ones on us, how can we write?
go down the corridor, turn right, turn right, right, then left.
straight down the stairs, left, right, and another left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
there you will find a key to get rid of your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought leaving the basement was awful.
have fun, the prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to duty.
can you not do that?
i don't see a thing here.
anybody remember where we're going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, double right, then left.
there was so much going on.
no, go straight down the corridor, down the hall,
"go back, do it right again, and left.
"then straight down the stairs,
"sola, right, and left again."
what are you?
smart.
illet will be a great show.
careful.
careful.
oh, god.
what is this place?
and be ready.
it was fun.
let's speed them up a bit.
okay, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
the power's running out, the generator should've been on patrol already.
damn it!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's freezing here.
look, the key.
yeah.
okay.
look, people.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think it's the warden.
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what, man?
"hello, brave contestants.
"welcome to clem harvis's office.
"a box in the middle of the room.
"the chess stones will determine your personal role.
"you cannot change your stones with other competitors.
"the rails were her favourite."
now it's your turn to put your hand in the box.
shit.
well, who wants first?
ben.
what's going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black rook.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
fuck!
that was really awful.
my little piggies, welcome to duty.
let me tell you about the pennyville state prison.
in 0000, when the cost was up, the cruel warden thought of destroying some expenses and raising his fortune.
these were the prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the director's crimes were revealed.
the last person who was sentenced to death here was warden harvis himself.
rumor has it the director is still wandering through the halls.
you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured souls under this building tonight.
first duty.
white queen.
try not to die!
anyone want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the church of prison to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first corridor.
that sounds great.
thank you.
damn it!
what happened?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, take it easy, randall.
turn right now and go straight.
they hung the babies!
children...
i think they're filling it with speaker guys.
voices are more effective than images to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
god!
that sounds very nice.
no, i'm fine, man.
freak.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
there was a sound.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're calling from the speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off the flashlight.
okay now?
open the marked pages from the bible...
"you will find the prayer of god there.
"there has been disrespect for this place that was sacred 00 years ago,
"now this is the office of the extraordinary events."
oh, "the opposite."
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do that.
"when you complete your mission...
"if there's no sign of the director,
"you can go back to camp."
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry to bother you anyway.
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
" protect us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"never let evil rule us.
"and protect us from enough...
"as we forgive those who owe us, forgive us our debts.
"give us our daily bread today.
"as in heaven...
"as in the sky,
"because rule and rule is yours."
please tell me i can go now.
"before i go camping,"
god, randall, you have to put out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look what's made for money.
where'd he go?
from what i understand, the people who did this job had to cut our connection to our homo friend for a more scary weather.
whatever.
absolutely, it went in the click.
guys?
i think we did something awesome.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, man, it's not that bad.
definitely not worth the money.
but complete the mission was worth money.
thank god i finished.
look, i'm still trembling.
i don't think i can do it again.
they can serve you again.
no kidding.
i swear you don't even know how you feel there.
it's like walking in a busy fog, just as cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go to the next one.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated.
let's just send scelzi down and check it out, you're on.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
either we talk or i go away or i go.
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i had a little research.
you mean, "don't fuck" and you're talking about the town girls you sleep with?
am i right?
big lips, broad hips, taylor.
okay, prison isn't just for men?
is there a women's department?
and that fucking crazy-ass director wouldn't have to walk around the women's department naked.
beat them up, rape them, get them pregnant, and starve them to death.
some say they feed their own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this real story is gonna make the show for the show!
everyone might be talking about us.
that's nothing compared to the story you made up.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do this, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
really?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they do.
good.
scelzi, what is that?
it's just a little something to get me out of the night.
you want some?
get your hairy ass here now, okay?
yes, captain.
hello?
you scared the shit out of me.
i have a great stuff.
suit yourself.
we're fully ready to begin.
i can tell you my biggest fear is being buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will set you free."
okay,
i'm at the end of liberty.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
fuck!
what?
blood.
it's not real blood.
no cursing, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs aren't down, but upstairs.
i'm sorry.
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down, you'll see a door with a finger door.
he says...
damn it!
"welcome to cell number five.
"if we consider the aggressive violence and the madness,
shit.
tell me what to do... and i'll get the hell out of here.
no!
thank you.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a prisoner can't commit suicide,
"now you will live the punishment sent to a prisoner."
okay, where's the pit?
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult task.
"what will you do when you're in the hole."
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my job.
connie.
what?
look at this.
what?
oh, no...
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back and you did add something to the show, and you ask me why you were fired?
this isn't our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you have to get that guy out, okay?
he's gonna screw up the show.
damn it!
we're fucked.
so you didn't bring this?
cut it out, no.
it's obvious.
what's obvious?
come closer.
i asked you why you put a camera in the control room.
yeah.
the surveillance footage... they want to record...
damn!
damn!
you're right.
isn't that brilliant?
absolutely brilliant.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to record how he scares us by putting things into the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black king and white horse.
duty four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you might be reassigned.
it's too smart.
okay, black king and white horse go right and go to the gas chamber.
the white queen and the black horse go straight, and they go to the prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"the hawk and the horse first turn right.
"and ride to the end of the corridor,
"and get down the stairs."
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, pick up.
we're in.
"welcome to the gathering room.
there must be a light behind your back, turn it on.
"black king and white horse go into the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
that place deserved the best, it was a real place.
it's the only place the legal department cleaned up.
isn't it beautiful?
pretty creepy.
oh, god.
what's that smell?
a documented true execution rooms often carry the smell of death itself.
of course, the smell is not your death.
if a man knows his final moments, his anxiety on the radar will cause him a lot of stinking substances.
in that case, the smell of the human smell we breathe now and the gas that killed him.
now it's fun, ladies and gentlemen.
black witness sitting in a chair.
black king?
that would be me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you'll find some meat and a pan.
"this meat is food."
man!
the prisoners have always eaten beef, pig...
"or there is no lamb or another meat...
"and they suspected it.
"they thought it was a nice meat they never tasted before."
you mean human flesh, right?
are you in?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i gave up.
you're gonna tie toni up.
i'm moving from here to you, toni must fully experience the fear of the previous prisoners before the gas is given.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends have some weird wishes.
are you okay?
okay.
"your job's gas teammate...
"to find the main van before he kills the gas."
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to vomit.
okay.
strange.
i can't do that.
i can't.
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
"no more donkey jokes."
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they'll pay the extra money."
do it for the team, girl.
are you gonna throw up?
thank you.
