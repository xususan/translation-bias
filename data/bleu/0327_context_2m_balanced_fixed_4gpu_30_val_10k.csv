michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, her brother, buster, who shared her bed.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i will.
i have to write a trial of at least 000 words about the morality of war and the possibility of a conflict.
i'm not sure our ethical teacher would like me to cheat while writing a trial.
so, you passed my ethics test.
actually, it was desperate, desperate, desperate for her teacher at sergegemichael bethbauerly.
even the hands of people who commit small crimes can be severely cut.
no ring ring ring no ring ring no ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
the s.d.k.'s eye was on us.
your father thought it would make us look better.
he must have faked my signature.
'maybe a year ago, i'll have a son who finished the soy cheese!
you gotta get me out of this.
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't look at her either.
i don't have a mother's kindness and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yes.
by the way, when did you sleep with anyone?
meanwhile, lindsay was giving george michael her homework.
why do i tell you this?
i guess there are some things you can't tell your father about.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to arrange his teacher for her father... to make her mother's job.
there's nothing wrong with that.
however, since you don't think about me for that, i must say i'm a little broken.
the stills can do that.
and the teachers can perform it.
surely, someday, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i find it, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay was never so proud of what she said her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i've been telling you about.
she is, really... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
you have a moustache.
i mean, the moustache has milk on it.
yeah.
but gob misunderstands the sentimentality of michael's kindness... and feels he's competition to interfere.
because, you know, beyond adorable... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
is it really, michael, shannon?
and there was a surprise visit to george sr.
i read all your teachings and took all your tapes.
and i watched it all over again.
george s.r. recently offered a series of suggestions... to make money from the spiritual spirit that he'd recently discovered.
i also lost two pounds of your banana bluth jail bars.
i came to find out at your place.
this is a good place to start.
and after michael got rid of the two girls he had an appointment with, he met lindsay at the parent-teacher night.
hey, linds, is this my imaginary product... or does this place have the same plan as our kitchen floor?
i think she's very suitable for you.
i used to think it would make her think that it was a motherhood.
besides, i can't rush into something like this just because my son wants me to, and marry somebody.
i'm miss baerly, the ethics teacher.
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of life that could have been destroyed without a thoughtful trigger.
and michael started to recognize his son's ethics teacher.
that's the "rrrrr" thing.
you know, so annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were kidding.
no, i was just laughing because you were laughing.
"rrrr!" - "rrrr!"
but, you know, - - - - - - - - - -
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite something to drink?
or... or... or... or... or
yes, he is.
i think that mr. daniels was having a stroke...
let's go get a drink.
yeah, maybe it'll help.
george soc was dealing with his own fan.
i've already told you a lot of my sin.
maybe you can tell me some of your sins.
well, there are legal symptoms showing my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me one of those things about... one of the things that happened in the college bedroom again.
and what did michael have today's second date on his date with miss bayerly...
michael, this little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it's him.
you have to rob her to freeze her for sure.
yes, mother.
they'll take her back.
don't take your shoes off, little master!
don't take your shoes off!
he's out of control.
who is it?
this is annyong, your father and i adopted it.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you and a new son are you?
lucille figured buster was worried, even jealous.
and he understood how it felt to be ignored.
annyyong is now your sister's sister annyyong
abort.
he's staying.
listen, i'll call you sonar again.
nice ride.
you making reservations for dinner?
he made a korean.
and after their meeting..
michael took a step he hadn't taken in years.
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we sneak in without waking everyone up?
this may not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i love.
so i took someone you love.
i said "nashbagerblairjam."
listen, i know you're trying to get back at me for the whole marta thing.
i was lying to you when i told you i wasn't going to try to get him to sleep, so...
he has to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i'm lucky i got rid of him.
no problem.
so romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i have to say i don't know it was real first.
but now... your moral teacher...
yeah, i did it for her.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm pretty sure you're interested in him for the point.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
is this about the lesson?
i mean, she loves him my loyalty...
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with her.
well, why did he do that?
why did he sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new...
he's not one of the good snipers targeting his target, and he's almost anywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think that he was...?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think she's old?
we don't even know how old she is.
no one knows.
she was having a little girl at different dances... and i was thinking about going to her, messing around with her, doing something...
"hey, you wanna dance?"
and i thought he was gonna say, "what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it differently across the mirror, but...
but, you know, it was, like, we were dancing with a joke or something.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should go out with someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've identified a difficult book to find a picture of saddam frustration in the bathroom suite.
"what would sadame do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's the same as our fire escape.
in prison, george sr was preparing for the evening of his most loyal fan.
when cindi lightballoon makes her own arrangements.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and when george michael was still angry at gob... he called the family expert on making trouble.
i know you went out with shannon.
that cheerleader?
yeah, he'll probably take her to one of those stupid different dances.
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr daniels... and i asked him... but he breathed and dropped the phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe i should go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hello.
my mother took him.
he's got me registered to do school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the situation with miss bearly and george michael.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality...
you see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's like she's in love with you, so...
he knows we're out.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most immoral thing i've ever heard.
well, you're only a half- semester teacher.
look, that was a preemptive move.
my brother was going to try to sleep with you.
so, i want to leave you at this exact moment and i'm not coming back to you.
i see.
from now on.
she went for a walk with george sr. cindi.
george.
and she's getting to know him.
you can totally spill your heart at me here.
it weighs on my soul.
you...
he's blowing the camera.
i'm taking you to the granyong dance, so this is your dinner, so it's away with my mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy.
watch your back, my immigration little brother!
and the different spring dance was at the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you don't let her in just because she doesn't have the perfect flaw of a perfectly flaw like you, the eyes of the apartment, the strong square-shaped jaw.
you wanna dance?
all right!
gob finally found shannon he was looking for...
gob found out he was cheating on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
sorry.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i messed up our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about it for a long time, and...
that's... that's your right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing at a high school dance?
i'm only here with my girlfriend.
yes, with my ethical teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
i'm really touched that you're trying to protect me after being so mean to you.
actually, gob mistook michael's morality teacher for citizenship.
man, he... he understands the type.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a citizenship teacher.
second move.
i was seeing mrs. baerly, and i never should have dragged gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never wanted to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laugh on some sad things, but...
i don't think we'll have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm getting this cake.
hey, you want to dance?
i can't believe this is working.
the next one's at development.
buster's pull is toast.
stop, stop, stop, stop!
there are no candles here.
mom's going crazy.
no, it's okay.
i light my candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
no problem.
right here, let me help you.
these?
okay, here, let me carry it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is something really extreme.
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we'll all go one day, right?
four months ago, each of you joined an interview, to attend an untold tv show.
and guess what?
you won.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm such a gay man and i'm proud of it.
you're adorable, aren't you?
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel from england.
me too.
that's my brother stanton, my parole officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him in the head.
she doesn't know.
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they look like barack obama these days.
each of you will earn $00,000, all you have to do is spend a night in this prison.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
fuck!
cool.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know if this is a prank?
right.
it's our third show, but we're not gonna publish until the fall.
to find out if this is a prank, you're gonna have to play the game and earn the money.
you will be asked to perform a series of missions.
the missions will force your limits, your courage and thought.
that sounds fun, right?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make up your mind now.
i'm in.
where am i signing?
i didn't have a girlfriend to admit it when she was high.
i need to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you're crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
go around.
you'll notice.
the sum of money equally in between the survivors, but if you all take the night off, there's a rich prize.
no money can keep me here for the night.
anyone else want to join her?
not me.
there's no way i'm going to the city with this pissy boy.
i'm in.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you guys are idiots.
it's a fucking party joke, they're all gonna fuck with you.
you're nothing but a bunch of idiots.
can't you see this is a recording party?
or we'll be famous.
there's a human head there!
don't worry, it's not real.
looks pretty real to me.
that's why they call our business special effects.
pretty cool, isn't it?
a little sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thanks to our reward special effects team.
follow me, fellas.
in hot swamp water, lazy crocodiles are waiting for their prey.
the indian crocodiles become long and benevolent.
such crocodiles...
guys.
i see you work as hard as always.
are we ready?
we're all set.
and absolutely.
keep it that way.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great that you scared them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are gonna go to the show.
you really looked like you were scared.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really gives me the creeps.
did you know that?
the dead homeless?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
that must be a big coincidence.
you really think it's safe there?
safe enough for the show insurance.
any more questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're recording.
each of you was chosen by your own free will, spent the night in jail, making $00,000 a head.
clear enough, isn't it?
okay, let's get this party started.
you can find anything you need at your base camp, that's the manager's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you've got all the ones on us, how can we write?
go down the corridor, turn right, turn right, right, then left.
straight down the stairs, left, right, and another left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
there you will find a key to get rid of your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought leaving the basement was awful.
have fun, the prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to duty.
can you not do that?
i don't see a thing here.
anybody remember where we're going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, double right, then left.
there was so much going on.
no, go straight down the corridor, down the hall,
"go back, do it right again, and left.
"then straight down the stairs,
"sola, right, and left again."
what are you?
smart.
illet will be a great show.
careful.
careful.
oh, god.
what is this place?
and be ready.
it was fun.
let's speed them up a bit.
okay, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
the power's running out, the generator should've been on patrol already.
damn it!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's freezing here.
look, the key.
yeah.
okay.
look, people.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think it's the warden.
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what, man?
"hello, brave contestants.
"welcome to clem harvis's office.
"a box in the middle of the room.
"the chess stones will determine your personal role.
"you cannot change your stones with other competitors.
"the rails were her favourite."
now it's your turn to put your hand in the box.
shit.
well, who wants first?
ben.
what's going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black rook.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
fuck!
that was really awful.
my little piggies, welcome to duty.
let me tell you about the pennyville state prison.
in 0000, when the cost was up, the cruel warden thought of destroying some expenses and raising his fortune.
these were the prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the director's crimes were revealed.
the last person who was sentenced to death here was warden harvis himself.
rumor has it the director is still wandering through the halls.
you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured souls under this building tonight.
first duty.
white queen.
try not to die!
anyone want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the church of prison to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first corridor.
that sounds great.
thank you.
damn it!
what happened?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, take it easy, randall.
turn right now and go straight.
they hung the babies!
children...
i think they're filling it with speaker guys.
voices are more effective than images to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
god!
that sounds very nice.
no, i'm fine, man.
freak.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
there was a sound.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're calling from the speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off the flashlight.
okay now?
open the marked pages from the bible...
"you will find the prayer of god there.
"there has been disrespect for this place that was sacred 00 years ago,
"now this is the office of the extraordinary events."
oh, "the opposite."
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do that.
"when you complete your mission...
"if there's no sign of the director,
"you can go back to camp."
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry to bother you anyway.
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
" protect us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"never let evil rule us.
"and protect us from enough...
"as we forgive those who owe us, forgive us our debts.
"give us our daily bread today.
"as in heaven...
"as in the sky,
"because rule and rule is yours."
please tell me i can go now.
"before i go camping,"
god, randall, you have to put out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look what's made for money.
where'd he go?
from what i understand, the people who did this job had to cut our connection to our homo friend for a more scary weather.
whatever.
absolutely, it went in the click.
guys?
i think we did something awesome.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, man, it's not that bad.
definitely not worth the money.
but complete the mission was worth money.
thank god i finished.
look, i'm still trembling.
i don't think i can do it again.
they can serve you again.
no kidding.
i swear you don't even know how you feel there.
it's like walking in a busy fog, just as cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go to the next one.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated.
let's just send scelzi down and check it out, you're on.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
either we talk or i go away or i go.
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i had a little research.
you mean, "don't fuck" and you're talking about the town girls you sleep with?
am i right?
big lips, broad hips, taylor.
okay, prison isn't just for men?
is there a women's department?
and that fucking crazy-ass director wouldn't have to walk around the women's department naked.
beat them up, rape them, get them pregnant, and starve them to death.
some say they feed their own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this real story is gonna make the show for the show!
everyone might be talking about us.
that's nothing compared to the story you made up.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do this, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
really?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they do.
good.
scelzi, what is that?
it's just a little something to get me out of the night.
you want some?
get your hairy ass here now, okay?
yes, captain.
hello?
you scared the shit out of me.
i have a great stuff.
suit yourself.
we're fully ready to begin.
i can tell you my biggest fear is being buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will set you free."
okay,
i'm at the end of liberty.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
fuck!
what?
blood.
it's not real blood.
no cursing, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs aren't down, but upstairs.
i'm sorry.
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down, you'll see a door with a finger door.
he says...
damn it!
"welcome to cell number five.
"if we consider the aggressive violence and the madness,
shit.
tell me what to do... and i'll get the hell out of here.
no!
thank you.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a prisoner can't commit suicide,
"now you will live the punishment sent to a prisoner."
okay, where's the pit?
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult task.
"what will you do when you're in the hole."
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my job.
connie.
what?
look at this.
what?
oh, no...
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back and you did add something to the show, and you ask me why you were fired?
this isn't our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you have to get that guy out, okay?
he's gonna screw up the show.
damn it!
we're fucked.
so you didn't bring this?
cut it out, no.
it's obvious.
what's obvious?
come closer.
i asked you why you put a camera in the control room.
yeah.
the surveillance footage... they want to record...
damn!
damn!
you're right.
isn't that brilliant?
absolutely brilliant.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to record how he scares us by putting things into the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black king and white horse.
duty four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you might be reassigned.
it's too smart.
okay, black king and white horse go right and go to the gas chamber.
the white queen and the black horse go straight, and they go to the prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"the hawk and the horse first turn right.
"and ride to the end of the corridor,
"and get down the stairs."
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, pick up.
we're in.
"welcome to the gathering room.
there must be a light behind your back, turn it on.
"black king and white horse go into the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
that place deserved the best, it was a real place.
it's the only place the legal department cleaned up.
isn't it beautiful?
pretty creepy.
oh, god.
what's that smell?
a documented true execution rooms often carry the smell of death itself.
of course, the smell is not your death.
if a man knows his final moments, his anxiety on the radar will cause him a lot of stinking substances.
in that case, the smell of the human smell we breathe now and the gas that killed him.
now it's fun, ladies and gentlemen.
black witness sitting in a chair.
black king?
that would be me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you'll find some meat and a pan.
"this meat is food."
man!
the prisoners have always eaten beef, pig...
"or there is no lamb or another meat...
"and they suspected it.
"they thought it was a nice meat they never tasted before."
you mean human flesh, right?
are you in?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i gave up.
you're gonna tie toni up.
i'm moving from here to you, toni must fully experience the fear of the previous prisoners before the gas is given.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends have some weird wishes.
are you okay?
okay.
"your job's gas teammate...
"to find the main van before he kills the gas."
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to vomit.
okay.
strange.
i can't do that.
i can't.
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
"no more donkey jokes."
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they'll pay the extra money."
do it for the team, girl.
are you gonna throw up?
thank you.

god!
who's that guy standing there?
smooth.
muscle.
let me out.
i don't know, con. this guy's starting to freak me out.
stop playing games.
let me out.
how's it going?
we need to talk to you.
outside?
yeah.
big news.
i think the company's playing us.
what?
who's there?
who are you?
show me the gas chamber.
and what are we gonna do with the castle teller?
where are they?
i don't know, just give me a second.
there.
you see that guy again?
wow!
who is he?
okay, how could she have got here so fast?
isn't that the guy in the picture?
yeah.
yeah, she looks like him.
nice.
no, not cool at all.
this guy either gets through walls, or there's more than one of these guys.
we've all been watching "pestj"?
mind if we pass?
please?
guys?
guys?
fake blood, fake crime.
they did good.
maybe even oscar.
no.
no, that's not true.
it's completely out of scenario.
sounds real to me.
connie, they're playing us.
trust me.
what?
hey.
they copied his picture.
what?
acting.
clothes.
easy.
wait.
no.
no.
he's a real ghost.
i can't translate any more.
if it goes any further, it'll be out of sight.
what?
this is a big prison.
i can't put a camera everywhere.
show me the pit.
show me the gas chamber.
taylor, somebody's got to go over there and see if they're okay.
i can tell they don't look good.
he's acting.
then where is scelzi?
i don't know.
probably hiding somewhere.
i'll call the office.
okay, you too.
good night.
they don't know what happened.
i feel bad.
okay, i'll go and prove it to you.
no problem.
anyone?
i'm coming.
i'll get my camera, maybe i'll get some good footage.
thank you.
you have to be nice to them.
you're gonna make it snappy!
"you're gonna take care of peace."
you know what?
you really are photogenic.
you're funny, kid.
i want to do my job now.
close the air conditioning.
come on.
connie, what do you want to do?
stop the game.
wow, this place looks haunted, right?
it gets a little weird.
where did he go?
i don't know.
i didn't see him.
it went this way.
not here.
what was that?
yeah, what was that?
shit.
taylor?
put angel on screen.
we have to get them out of there.
can you hear me?
listen to me.
there's been some changes in the plan.
we need to stop the show.
what?
why?
i'll be honest with you.
there's another person with you.
who?
we're not sure.
i want you to get out there as fast as possible, okay?
are you playing games with me?
you're trying to scare me.
open the door.
i want to win and get my money.
open the door!
who opened the door?
sorry, you're not serious, are you?
idiot!
your job is to memorize and locate the cell seven that's marked.
lucky!
in this cell, warden harvis was wounded deadly by a prisoner.
you'll find a key in that cell, this key will release your friend in the hole and the gas chamber.
great.
is that all?
it was the easiest money i ever made.
what am i afraid of?
nothing.
angel!
stanton?
help!
well, now it's out of my sight.
hello?
who's there?
hello?
angel?
angel.
let me down.
who are you?
angel?
angel!
what... what... what... what...
it's not real.
let me down.
wait.
it's you.
no!
angel, are you okay?
he killed my brother.
he's gonna kill me, too.
he killed my brother.
new jersey school of acting.
not bad for someone like me, is it?
connie, are you there?
yeah.
how could you organize this?
we've been through a lot.
it's gonna be a great show.
i'll see you later.
let me get this shit first?
you're such an asshole.
you said you wanted a great show, right?
you got what you wanted.
yeah.
untie sei, i'll take dixon and stanton.
okay, snow, we're stopping now.
get clean and change.
prepare for pati and champagne.
excellent acting.
show's over.
toni?
good job, dixon.
okay, dixon.
it's over, man.
are you okay?
stop playing, snow.
are you gonna say something?
we have to get them out of there.
we have to get them out of there.
get it out of my face!
fight new coordinates: 0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0
copy that, atc.
i spy with my little eye beginning with the y.
if you don't understand, you'll lose as a punishment.
rain?
london, the package was supposed to be in cia custody 00 minutes ago.
our aircraft is waiting.
it's a good thing our guest wasn't in a hurry.
traffic tower says they're moving in five minutes.
the home office's closets are out.
we're gonna need a little more creative about our funding.
where the hell is oliver?
where's the plane protection?
you can break the rules, but you need a special order.
something must be done.
director general.
i know you don't like hearing this from a politician, but reform is coming.
do you know that elevator is for emergency only?
escort 0, what's your status?
are you restless, juney?
you'll be less nervous if you just keep being my london boyfriend.
that position won't be open for long.
i spy with my little eye beginning with this letter...
the engines are going at the last speed.
put them on the screen.
calum, nearest police units?
whatever we have, come on.
code 0!
attack is happening!
oh, god.
june, for god's sake, don't.
get out, now!
the deadly force is allowed to use.
open the van or everyone dies!
open the truck, now!
pearce.
the americans will crucify us.
your operation, harry.
say again, command center?
lower your weapons and release qasim.
what the fuck are you doing, harry?
open the gates!
open the gates!
come on, come on, come on!
command, the prisoner has escaped!
heading north!
no, no!
keaton!
the command center is chasing agent two on foot.
any other images?
follow her.
the nearest armed unit is five minutes away.
the helicopter's 00 miles away.
barriers?
in position.
the other side of the tunnel is the last one.
they have nowhere to go.
sco00, 0 minutes away.
go.
agent 0, report.
ed, wait.
agent 0, report.
i repeat, the cia liaison officer has been shot.
agent 0, do you see qasim?
command, i heard a vehicle.
they shut everything down.
it's over.
the bbc can confirm that the american terrorist leader adam qasim has escaped from mi0 custody in the history of the organization.
turns out the security convoy transporting qasim was attacked at raf northolt's route.
you say it's not war but murder because it's in the west streets.
because in new york, in washington, you didn't want that in london.
but neither did pakistan's children.
when they get shot by drone airplanes, they call it murder.
qasim is offering a new kind of threat.
he hasn't targeted civilians until now.
our models show a 00% chance of an attack within 00 hours.
the more pressure goes under, the smaller the window.
i can't say that with the tape recorder...
the foreign minister is coming tomorrow.
we serve the british people, not washington.
if that's not true, we're already finished.
the americans think we no longer serve the purpose.
we need a head.
i'll be relieved of duty in the morning.
have you heard anything about qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, what happens to me if you get out?
you're out, too.
no one else knows that qasim is in his web.
just get out.
will holloway?
go.
how's life after mi0?
you're not from the moscow department.
london needs you.
is there anyone you should say goodbye to?
thank you.
we know about harry's connection to your family, so we understand this may not be easy for you.
even if he's dead, it's okay.
harry is too arrogant to kill himself.
he was acting like he was gonna kill himself.
she went to her grave.
the love of your life.
harry's team has noticed a change in harry's attitude since she died.
she was emotionally distant, cold, started drinking high amounts of alcohol.
the water would be below 0 degrees.
he'd have hypothermia before he got to the bank.
this is a picture before you entered this land, and the one you said was taken after the jump.
before she disappeared, harry made two encrypted phone calls.
your old emergency message box.
why did he call you?
i have no idea.
i talked to him the last time he took me from mi0 0 years ago.
he wants to talk right now.
that makes you useful.
can you help us find her?
no, thank you.
and you talk a lot about harry, berlin?
the night your father died?
if anything else, mace, i have a right to know.
i don't think i can...
if you weren't really gonna kill her, you told me what you wanted to say.
find harry so you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
i thought i was taking that title to the grave.
lately, she's the head of anti-terrorist for her majesty's security services.
funny, but who are you really?
these two words are someone who knows the importance of you.
asma shishani.
go.
how did you find me?
what do you want?
i know someone did it on my side.
they never told me who they were.
of course not, but you must have had a connection.
it's a phone number, that's all.
the phone number's also useful.
in return, i'll give you what you want.
impossible.
he said he was a human rights lawyer.
your government helped them after they put my two brothers in jail.
but after i was released, she became too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if he's an agent, he's not one of us.
then don't be a problem, tell me again it doesn't matter to you.
keep her alive, she's the guarantee you'll keep my word.
i don't need a guarantee.
take her to a hospital, or the deal's off!
what she needs is mercy.
no!
she has a daughter.
and you sent her after me?
you put him in danger, and now you refuse to save him from pain?
what the fuck are you?
don't send video to his family.
harry... harry... harry... harry...
you have a deal.
according to the bbc, the fugitive has no progress in the capture of adam qasim.
the national threat level is critical, so there's an attack on the hand tower.
in the economy news, the ftse 000 fell again this morning and sterlin continued to breathe, euros, other funds.
there's a new intel on harry.
he's got a convulsive mistake we put on his trail to kent cast.
holloway, this is classified information.
we found explosive marks there, too.
you've known him longer than any of us.
do you think it's possible that qasim somehow got harry involved?
take her with you?
i don't know.
anyway, you find harry, we find qasim.
anything for holloway?
here you go.
tomorrow, 00:00.
"pappy 0, a knee a, park at three o'clock.
then open your eyes four.
i hope you come alone.
just for protection.
if you can't get a crazy cold war purple without hitting us, we're in trouble.
i promise.
not yet.
we're playing this game through harry's way until we see him.
copy that.
doors opening.
go.
ground floor.
doors opening.
open sightings, multiple exits.
repeat, holloway.
things harry needs for an interview.
yes, mr. holloway, your uncle said he'd meet you at the coffee shop.
she left her cell phone at home.
the guy in the parking lot, get rid of him.
she'd be dressed as a mi0 shirt.
listen to me.
stop underestimating harry.
don't think he's gonna risk your men.
wait for the signal...
what is it, alpha 0?
holloway?
holloway, where are you going?
wait.
no, we have no order there.
don't move.
holloway, freeze!
terminal 0b.
doors closing.
he booked me a flight.
pa000, glasgow plane.
i'm going to glow.
call the douglasow office.
get me the airport police.
priority code sigma nine.
the police want a clear path to the terminal.
and get us clearance for heathrow security.
the passengers on the flight plan of the glasgow...
holloway, don't get in the air.
what am i doing here, harry?
i had to find someone i can trust outside the service.
it's a short list when you go drunk, crazy and dead.
to be honest, the only person i can say is someone who thinks i ruined his life.
qasim's escape was arranged by someone at the top of the service.
by one of the people who asked you to follow me.
that's why i had to disappear.
qasim was holding it.
he's our only link to the traitor.
once it's in the system, it'll be shut.
he's planning an attack.
someone's trying to destroy themselves.
you're crazy.
ruth's death...
don't!
look at you, that's all i want.
what are you waiting for, harry?
mi0 was everything to me and you took it from me, for nothing.
hate me all you want, but i think you believe in services.
what happened in berlin?
did they fool you like that?
this might not end up like you expected.
i'm afraid i have to tell them that there's something in the lining of your jacket.
nothing there, but they'll have to check it out.
i'll send you a number.
call me in 00 hours, please.
i'm security services.
hands behind your back!
you just let her go.
calm down, francis.
we don't want you to have a heart attack.
the deadly one.
mi0 is a complete liability at the moment, and i'm the last friend in the government of mi0.
so you have to be really nice to me right now.
in other words, is he crazy?
this isn't contradictable with his last three psych evaluation.
she refused to join.
harry pearce hasn't stopped being.
as crazy as it may be, i'll catch him anyway...
for instance.
she asked me to help her disappear.
didn't it occur to you to accept your request and bring her to us?
just because your life hasn't been shit since harry kicked you out doesn't mean we can't put your life in any more shit.
since we threaten each other, all three of you stay out of the blood that you haven't flipped on the cliff.
your entire organization seems to be disposed of at the moment.
find qasim.
fully loaded.
they're ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i saw that name working on a case.
i thought they got you off duty.
they took it.
now what really happened?
kidnapping may have been arranged by someone in the service.
do you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i left it two weeks ago.
there must be one around here.
tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't apply.
when i was 00, i was hanging out with a kid who makes money transfers.
k section was interested in some people using it, so they got to me.
you started as an agent?
and when i was done, they asked me to be trained as an officer.
when i told you, my family came back to me.
and if someone you worked for helped qasim escape, that would be a problem, wouldn't it?
all right.
something felt wrong that day.
robass, my team leader, he was in front with me.
he told me not to open the weapons conspiracy.
he ordered me to chase him.
where does she live?
loaded.
w00 accounting.
panama city.
the service fund.
june, what are you...
who are you?
you told me not to chase qasim.
you told me not to chase when i treated my gun.
we took a vow, rob.
i'm not saying anything until we get to thames house.
we're not going to thames house.
will, what did you find?
qasim's bodyguards were deliberately weakened.
the team leader was involved.
just a shoemaker.
find out who gave the order.
the americans think mi0 is a weak link, and i think one of them is joining them.
when qasim ran away, we fell out of sight.
the cia got the job completely.
fire... fire... fire... fire...
he was gonna shoot.
her pulse...
dead, dead.
he's dead.
listen.
you should go home.
june!
i'll handle this, but you have to go, now.
i didn't hear a piece of you getting killed with a song like that.
who's warrender's dirty shot?
landon miller.
agency hawk.
he's trying to secure his continued support, hopefully not to give the keys to the kingdom.
every time i see you, francis, you seem to be buried another inch or two deeper in the recesses of a swivel from langley or the pentagon.
you don't have to tell me.
i don't think at times like these, we shouldn't forget whose flag was released.
francis.
i'm trying to help, but he's basically accusing me of doing business for the cia.
tonight, your generals, your politicians, your spies met for a celebration.
tonight, we attack the hearts of their powers.
our enemy, your sons and daughters, the politicians who sent your daughters to die in illegal wars.
you are criminals who spy on you like you are.
this war is beyond religious differences.
all flights out of the kingdom of the united states...
you had it.
warrender lived.
if you have a way to get to qasim, say it now.
there's another way.
qasim's wife.
asma shishani.
the woman is fsb's hand.
if i find out where they hired her, he gives the traitor.
you made a deal with her.
yeah.
and if we succeed, it will lead us right to him.
surrender and set it up.
how do you know she's holding the russians?
in exchange for a cia agent who was exposed in moscow.
i can get through, but you need to open the secret door.
it's a ip address.
you're kidding.
it's the only way, will.
harry's getting help from somewhere.
i've seized your old contacts, but i need access to the personnel files to do it properly.
but it still doesn't take you anywhere exciting.
in position.
looks like i'm gonna have to play more extra bandwidth.
your drink.
malcolm?
all right, i'm in.
i'm looking at the server now.
harry, we gotta go.
can't we do this faster?
i can do it.
but unfortunately, this machine is a century ago.
the g branch already took these.
erin watts.
it might be worth a closer look.
fill the blanks for me.
but a spy's out.
i almost got him out.
i was a colleague for less than a year.
or they're making you choose late.
all right, i'll leave you alone.
is it?
am i sure why?
i'm sorry, will.
harry.
harry!
harry, what did you do?
stay away from the computer.
i didn't have to say this before, but i hope you know what you're doing.
harry works with qasim?
he stole an entire gchq data archives.
everything we have on our west agent friends in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
she showed up at schaefield airport cctv.
i don't know.
harry didn't attack that cyber himself.
then who's helping him?
except you.
and you still protect her.
why?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i'll find him.
and there's a threat.
according to analysis, there'll be a large scale attack within 00 hours, multiple targets.
an agent in charge of qasim's escape is missing.
there are signs of struggle at home.
do you know anything about that?
how's your mother, holloway?
i heard it wasn't very good.
he hasn't packed since your dad died.
understandable, really.
and then that door work comes.
i know, i know.
harry was right about something.
you're not good enough.
home secretary, can we really hope that qasim will stop attacking again?
we've destroyed our freedom and threat to our way of life.
your ability to hurt us may be important, but it's the end.
you'll find that we have no limits.
they don't listen.
they never killed our women?
we're making the world a better place, brother.
the transplant team is in place at the airport.
we have a warrant by the atc to block the road to the prisoner when necessary.
i think i owe you one.
you were absolutely right about vass.
danke.
alexanderplatz.
it's on the southwest corner of the metron, 00:00.
we have a safe house.
call it nostalgia.
don't forget to bring the archives.
don't forget to bring his wife.
how did you find me?
there's only one place in berlin to meet.
you told me.
the northern corner of alexanderplatz.
no emotional.
that's the price of qasim's wife.
when she comes out of fsb custody, qasim will give me a number.
he'll take me to the traitor.
they're going to destroy the service where it's vulnerable to take it.
get in the car, harry.
there's an old hotel 00 minutes away.
my contact can meet us there with three clean passports to us.
you're going home.
i'm sorry about that.
why are you here, mrs. keaton?
keep walking, harry.
i killed someone because of you.
you're c0, right?
what are you doing, harry?
talent.
and which one of you found it?
jesus christ, will.
everything is ready.
and vass?
when he came to my house, i reported it.
i said someone was asking about qasim's escape.
they tied me to the command center and they told me what to do.
they went to vass's house before us and planted the evidence.
i've arranged for vass to escape.
you think i want to do it?
i know my mission.
i'm the only one here who knows.
you were set.
he's right, will.
but i wonder if miss keaton is sure about me.
it was a secure chain of command.
what was i supposed to do?
do you believe him?
yeah.
i'm sure your men will come and find you if your usefulness is still available.
what did you think they would do to you after all this was over?
i did what they asked me to do.
we're changing the deal.
we're taking qasim's wife to london.
tell him to come to the trade or he'll never see his wife again.
let's go get her.
what happened to alexanderplatz?
sudden agoraphobia.
i'm afraid there was something wrong with qasim's wife.
at least work enough to put it in my car.
harry.
colonel.
i hate to be indefinite, but we're gonna need your clothes.
while the search for adam qasim is focused on the search for qasim, everyone who travels in the united kingdom's national ray line requires valid identities, and must enter the governor's control.
i got your wife.
let me talk to him.
the russians put him to sleep and...
bullshit.
i'm bringing her to london.
no.
i'll tell your whore you said goodbye.
is the baby too much?
no, it's you.
i trusted june.
you were right to take me off duty.
despite everything i've done, you're still trying to do something good here.
i won't let your sacrifices be for nothing.
it was here.
was it fast?
he could have left me, but he chose not to leave.
you try anything, anything, i can't guarantee anyone's safety.
no one.
you bring my wife, i'll give you your phone number.
here we go.
hello?
holloway.
this message came from the h department.
ben.
we can catch qasim, but we need help.
and let's go.
one clean choice, hannah.
trust me, and help me.
or go.
do well or do well, right?
shit.
they're approaching the location.
the self-replicating algorithm that i wrote last night is constantly upgrading all potential looks.
well, it's not cutting the water?
please.
all right, here we are.
how much time do we have?
i'm looking at 000.
give me something.
the second he realizes we're playing him, he's gone.
wait.
she worked 00 seconds ago.
are you sure?
yes, confirmed.
the camera was disabled in the last minute.
third floor roof, east corner.
harry, we have to stall.
i really hope you're looking at us.
yes?
try the south.
i have his wife.
you're supposed to check south.
give me the number.
give me the number or we'll go.
turn around now or you're dead.
here.
him too.
i haven't got it yet.
you have 0 seconds to turn around.
turn.
maybe this guy never saw her.
almost there.
him?
kill.
give me the number.
don't!
stop!
no!
okay?
will, she's fine.
the shooter is dead.
then it's over.
malcolm, feather.
yes?
my wife is dead, isn't she?
harry, listen.
hannah will let us know.
harry?
hannah, why did harry take off the earphones?
i don't know.
let us know.
bring sco00 here, now.
two trucks full of rdx are leaving the porthouse north industries park within the next 00 minutes.
how do you know?
qasim just said.
trucks full of bombs leaving in 00 minutes.
i think we got him.
let's go!
armed police!
stay where you are!
clear!
clear!
anybody seen the primary target?
negative!
negative!
negative, sir.
command center, area clear.
harry.
he sold his own men.
why would he do that?
what did you do?
armed police!
freeze!
move!
you have to tell them everything, harry.
i think we have a lot to talk about.
this might be way out of line.
since the southwest corner of alexanderplatz.
keep your eye on holloway.
make sure he's safe.
maybe we won't be so hasty.
have you found qasim?
harry will talk.
you still don't know her.
qasim gave up his entire operation.
what did you tell him?
i should have thought they'd release you after berlin.
they want to offer you a deal.
throw it all over harry and go.
i told them i'd quit after i did.
there's no way out.
i can't.
there's an emergency backup key hanging around your neck.
whatever you're after...
what would ruth think?
what did you give her?
check the back.
southwest corner.
i found harry in the northern corner of alexanderplatz.
the opposite.
where you can trap someone.
harry?
i gave it to her.
get down!
get down!
get down!
lock us down.
get down!
get down!
we're not here for you!
we came for them.
get down!
think of your families.
hamza.
why?
there are 00 men on the other side of these doors.
you must surrender.
come here.
open up!
if you think we're negotiating...
open the door.
but he'll kill us.
there are so many demons in a room.
the only way out of here alive is to surrender...
you think i want out?
how many people in this room have ended life?
the lives of my people.
your people?
you didn't ask to speak for them, to kill for them.
if you want a hostage...
i think he made it clear he wasn't interested in hostages.
i'm the director of mi0.
kill me and put the gun down.
otherwise, you're nothing but a dead terrorist.
no one will ever see you as a hero.
when we're done, you're gonna be a drunk, skinny, skinny, beatin' his wife.
we'll give them free tickets to disneyland in return to tell them you begged them to pee on a few marrakech male prostitutes.
we can't remember you very well, can we, adam?
wait, wait, wait.
i got the chopper back.
but...
you fucking coward.
i thought you were fighting a higher standard.
i'm sorry about your wife's death, adam.
i know what this can do to you.
is that supposed to stop me?
it's okay.
stop!
why did you bring him here?
i made a choice.
without plan b.
why do you think i kept you out of that room?
people are still dead, harry.
less than the ones who are going to die in the explosions.
how could you make such a choice?
this is my job.
auntie, can you come outside and play?
hello, geraldine.
finally, it comes down to who tells the most long lie.
right?
if we had kept that morning, qasim would never have run away.
you gave met's air unit an order to turn down all mi0 requests, right?
that's the advantage of being a maniac.
i don't need to prove it.
sacrificing his own services so he can be questioned by a foreign power.
the americans would have made you the general manager, no doubt.
how many more lives was that promotion worth?
what did you think you did it, harry?
the service dies.
but if i gave up the moment i realized i was on the losing side, my career would be too short.
blowing my head off, finding my 00-year-old nephew...
i think this came from you.
what is it?
the thin intestinal intestines are punctured for more than 0 hours or unstoppable bleeding.
it doesn't leave a mark.
how smart.
i was afraid that would be the answer.
so i took the chance to choose.
it's not lunch that makes you sick.
i ate beef ribs.
tell me you're lying, harry.
please.
tell me you didn't betray your country.
it's already been 0 hours, geraldine.
you can spend the last two hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd play with your beautiful niece.
i'm thinking.
your message said you'd tell me something.
they're watching ruth's grave.
you can't go anymore.
i actually have something that you should be.
your father was wearing this the night he died.
he's got everything that's gonna work out, and he found a way to get into the fsb archives somewhere.
she was wearing a wedding ring the night of her operation?
i didn't kick you out because you're not good enough.
after your father, i couldn't...
i should have protected you.
the good don't last forever, will.
then who will?
they're like me.
if you know your problem and tell the men at the door, it'll help.
there's room for every guest at hotel junior high.
gather around in one order.
these new problems kill in the dark.
these people will be grateful to you when the darkness falls.
i think we should keep them here to keep them safe, but i worry that things get worse.
they have no idea who caused the dark problem.
and we don't have to worry about what's hiding in the dark.
we still haven't figured out how to handle that fog wall yet.
maybe this is a blessing.
this was the latest from in-flight safetics.
i'm on your side and i might need a new job.
i'm under control, but if i can get another pillow for my beauty sleep, it'll be appreciated.
try to make things right.
we talked about this.
it's almost impossible to remove the problem without killing someone with a problem.
of course, i just need some unlikely materials to provide that i don't have, and maybe information that doesn't exist.
i'm gonna need a team.
any idea what's going on?
but there's a bad element.
it's the only way to protect the rest of us.
driving's risky because of the magnet problem.
an engineer to help repair the power plant.
she volunteered as soon as she knew.
if things don't work out, you can use her problem for operator.
what the hell are you doing?
the untraceable killer is out there somewhere.
and i guess he wants to prove to you that he really wants to help.
okay, well, whatever the reason, just keep an eye on her for me, okay?
because neither of us is immune to new problems.
i'm not just saying it's because it's my mom
i'll call the person who caused the dark trouble when you're gone.
he stole those batteries and put us in danger.
there was no choice, dwight.
this is the third case in two weeks.
now the serial killer is in this building.
all right, i'm gonna go talk to dwight.
my dad always said you were a good man.
mara's father?
it might be a way, but it might seem more frightening if you want me to explain, so don't ask.
even on the map, maine, i can't find haven.
are you telling me you can't find a town with a 00,000 population?
that's not what caused it.
then why didn't we use aether in the first place to finish the troubles?
i can't bring them in when they're sealed.
so how do we find it?
gloria brought a box of stuff that duke left in gull.
i don't think william has the amount of aether i need, and aether is just the first phase.
you told his wife you'd find him.
it's easy to decide on the side, but sometimes it's not what it looks like
i have a town to protect.
no wonder the plant's working at 00%.
guys, i'll try, but remember, i've never done anything like this before.
they made me park the car here so i could talk to you, but i don't have enough money to pay for the oil exchange.
if all goes well, i'll be back with aether before the sun goes down.
this is peggy's husband, rolf.
there's enough panic and fear.
the same killer who killed my son 00 years ago?
we call him "the killer who didn't leave a trace."
what else are you hiding from me, vince?
dwight's doing everything he can to make the rules go away, but he's not the type to kill people.
in this haven, banishment is the same thing as execution.
thanks to our friend there, we keep them in some kind of prison.
he says the generator works at 00%.
damn, when the generator overloaded it must have cleared the energy reserves.
that explains why the department's power's in town.
at this speed, like, five minutes.
they're almost done, and they're the only thing that protects us from dying in the dark.
here, i rearranged the generator's arrangements to get the power to the town faster, but there's nothing more we can do.
they better.
help each other.
put the lights around you.
share your supplies.
you see, i'm happy here.
i got your message.
get in the car now.
come on, jump!
we should be thankful if the war lies ahead of us, even with slean.
i don't think there's anything worse than being in love.
i don't like it here.
every story has two sides.
whoever's behind this is a traitor.
let's go.
he asked me to represent him at slean's wedding.
palace, you are my brother's love.
that's why you're my brother.
you've seen bigger places than this place in the iraqi realms.
none of them were governed by a woman.
you must choose a second person to keep you company and watch your interests during the ritual.
then you will hear the bonds of your friends and relatives.
i have no relatives here.
my mother and the others will keep you company.
kela, this is the palace from bregan.
rheda, must i always have protection?
i don't understand these things.
but i know that i must marry slean.
i'll love him.
this marriage can't happen.
abrecan trusts you.
what do you do?
carpenter.
then they can use you on the wall.
who are you?
a friend of the council.
like i said, i have business to attend to.
we need to figure out how to handle it.
varr said i couldn't accept gifts.
we'll keep it then.
every bride should smell good when the wedding time comes.
remember, this is our secret.
sit down.
we'll get what we're gonna get when we look at the wounded.
you wanted to talk?
all right.
kela, it's time for the ritual.
elvina, will you be my second?
for the game.
we need to talk sometime.
we need to discuss reasons why marriage shouldn't work.
if we don't fulfill our mission, their marriage can be canceled.
beowful!
let's celebrate.
old tradition!
the dress smells pimp.
i'm so sorry.
it was just a little mistake.
that's it.
we're gonna help slean give the mark to his bride.
sounds easy.
breca!
open the door!
come on, you stinking mudborn.
come on!
come on!
give me your arm.
come on!
slean.
quiet, kela is sleeping.
are they ready for this marriage?
i don't understand why slean didn't want to marry kela.
i don't think so.
put your feelings aside and do what's best for everyone.
would you put aside what you want for others?
that's all we have to do.
if somebody pleases others their whole life, that person doesn't actually live.
it must make a man feel free to think that way.
try it.
tell every rock the truth.
then you can look at each other and light the fire that symbolizes your marriage.
then you'll be husband and wife.
have you loved someone before?
no.
i thought you were...
do you want to be a thane?
tell my uncle i'm done with him.
yeah.
come on!
go!
you let him go.
we're not done here yet.
don't you understand?
i betrayed my mother and set up a dump with my uncle.
this woman was sent here to kill you!
i don't know.
was it?
i killed my brother.
he was the one who should have been there today.
even if the world was destroyed, mara had everything.
people loved him because he was kind.
my dad loved her first.
rowan and the lovers.
then i had the chance to escape.
i wouldn't need anything.
she died of a fever.
he was getting better.
i poisoned her.
slean, i'm not gonna tell anybody what they're doing here today and what's going on.
or stay.
i know, but it's beowful.
she went to bed last night.
but we can choose who we can draw our fate with.
light the fire with me.
you want to be a shane?
i can help you.
against what's against you.
they can't take it away from you, rheda.
with this marriage, you are the shieldlands jarl.
these rules of jarl must be used by every tribe.
if the blood doesn't pay, a killer's life will end.
the thieves will be branded out of society.
the price of all the merchandising in shieldlands will be set by jarl.
what's the right to name a fish price?
we're the ones who risk their lives to catch a billboard every summer.
you should have told me about the rules.
you were where your people needed you the most, in the watch.
i couldn't distract you.
that was messy enough.
you're late for the pandiri.
some people think you kidnapped her again.
but if you fail, bregan will be miserable and open the winter.
breca's wanted for murder, you know that.
kill him!
kill breca now!
i got it!
you do that without any explanation, and we all die.
after he escaped the gallows, he hired us to turn breca into his blood.
the guy who helped her escape the first time?
that's why we'll welcome you.
but we should keep breca.
heorot could be holding on to our gates as we speak!
when did we kill young women?
what do you mean?
you've been hiding in the shadows for so long, abrecan.
don't forget who you're talking to.
talk.
the boy wants breca's life or blood money for his brother's murder.
i didn't mean to kill anyone.
hurry!
thank you.
breca made my mother fall in love with herself.
he calls the widows he thinks he's got money, then he steals the money and he runs away.
he left my mother and took everything precious with him.
my brother went after you.
but it cost you your life.
breca, is that true?
i'll pay for the boy's blood money.
lila, do you have 00 silver dollars?
i don't want money, i want blood!
silence!
breca will be released if her blood is paid.
you lied to me.
pandiri.
pandiri!
tie him up now.
get ready, they're coming.
i saw it.
get out!
the council has gathered.
he wants to take my place while i'm wasting the bill.
you let me down, she married slean keela, rheda was jarl!
you don't understand.
tell the council our enemies are gathered, that your sister cannot rule, that you want to save shieldlands.
so tell me you're distracted.
tell me.
i'm sorry.
i knew breca killed someone, but the story she told me was different.
it's just her fault.
lila, no one would think bad things about you...
that's all i got.
did you bring it?
there's no 00 silver here.
not enough.
and i'm gonna hold breca while i see it.
was there enough money?
lila?
turn it off, beowulf, please.
you won't talk to lila.
get on your horse, leave heorot and never come back.
there's no room for you here anymore.
if herot's attacked, i want to fight properly.
if herot's attacked, i'll protect you.
let's try it.
it's not about mudborn.
i don't want to talk about him.
i want to know why you lied about teaching me.
it's wasted on you.
you don't even want to be spoiled.
really?
i didn't know we trained the blacksmith!
go.
now!
is he fighting girls now?
the view was more like the blacksmith was training the huskarl.
i know you think i let you down.
that i couldn't focus on my duties in bregan.
but i have reasons.
you're talking betrayal to one of your own blood.
a warrior in the centre of this land needs a warrior!
someone who's gonna get your people out of the dark.
a man in power to take control!
you're talking about betraying your sister to hide the truth that you can't provide for your people.
what's the point of having fish if we're all going to be slaughtered?
i am here to give our thane the vote of no confidence.
the ones against abrecan being a thane.
decided.
a new thane will be appointed and announced in the morning.
get up.
next.
no one.
don't think this is a game!
we're lazy, distracted.
this is gonna work here.
from now on, we'll work like dad hrothgar.
i didn't mean to interrupt.
you're a good teacher.
a big thane wants a strong army behind it.
we don't have to share the same bed, but if we don't share the same room, people will start talking.
i always liked watching heorot from here.
it looks invincible.
if i tell mom the truth, i lose her trust.
and my chance to rule one day.
what if abrecan attacks?
heorot might fall.
aren't you going to give advice?
i trust you.
the decision you make is right.
i'll be there when i make it.
you will be thane.
you just have to believe it.
pandiri.
pandiri!
it's the bill!
play the horn!
i command you, steal the horn!
abrecan, give it up.
if we don't act now, we'll get the chance.
why... why... why... why...
you, help me carry the net.
help me with the net now.
why don't you help me?
pandiri!
come on, hurry up!
go find me a sack.
people shouldn't leave their precious things anywhere.
you owe my mother an apology.
but i'm a warrior and our honor is at stake.
so i'll take your life.
go back to mommy, little girl.
greetings.
i didn't need your help.
because he didn't have enough money to save you.
be thankful you didn't kill him, vishka.
if we can't place the nets, our prey will slip away.
no, he won't.
get ready.
abrecan, no!
hold the rope steady!
hurry, they'll eat you raw!
pandiri, pandiri!
pandiri, pandiri!
hold on!
now get back!
take a look.
there will be songs about this hunt.
a hunt you won.
i have a dream about us.
being the biggest tribe in shieldlands!
we will not follow the laws of a jarl who can't even keep a sword.
who's with me?
abrecan, abrecan, abrecan!
i have to warn beowf.
bregan!
elvina!
their fighters are coming together.
to destroy us this time.
beowful!
if we turn around today, we see more danger and more harm coming from religious beliefs.
my wife, stand-up shows that if i talked about soviet communism or stalin's savage, it would be less embarrassing.
that's the situation of the kind of interrogation, especially the philosophy, that makes people feel trouble.
presenting a situation perfectly correct in itself can cause serious damage.
when the prophecy doesn't happen, we make fun of those people and the whole world makes fun of us.
with richard dawkins on account of this, i had a friendly opinion.
maybe richard and i should be more aggressive.
especially america is shaken with christian faith.
they're sure the world is what their religion says.
we'll get rid of the bad guys.
i wish i could write a book like that, if i could.
but of course, one of my fears, what happens next.
what kind of mess?
how true is it to the people who think that religion is protecting our civilization and the good in us somehow?
listen, for a lot of people, ahlaki is like viagra.
if that's true, if religion does lead to the moral lives of the people, then anyone will have to go out seriously, we'll have to be exonerated and get down to business.
because there may be a lot of people down there, and we can make a chaos out of these people's fear.
a lot of people want their lives to mean something, and where does that come from?
but there must be something better than religion.
yes, there is certain hope.
let's see what happens.
of course.
at least you didn't get a piercing.
i don't know how to explain this to amy.
i'm the stupidest man in the world.
all right, cut it out.
i'm the stupidest man in the world.
well, you win this.
i can't find emma's papers.
honey, just so you know, even if you find the original receipt, you can't return the baby.
when angela left emma at my door, i need to sign and find the only paper that he gave me.
i'm gonna get health insurance for me and how responsible i am.
i haven't talked to her since the night we did emma.
calm down.
you gave me all the important paperwork for the baby to be safe.
do you have all the papers?
his dad's little girl is his big girl.
something with balloons.
that looks good!
you robbed a clown?
it's your birthday!
my first birthday tomorrow.
you used to party all the time when you were a kid.
after celebrating my birthday...
"happy birthday, miley." "money." "
the papers i kept for you.
how irresponsible do you think i am?
but i...
i may not have posted them on time or mail them, and i may not be the only one of emma's retainers.
we were all excited for the new baby, and i didn't have the stamp!
look, we just need to get angela to sign this paper again, and it's okay.
since you're ben's best friend and the only person who saw the girl...
i like it, all right.
all right, emma's finally asleep.
hey, danny, what's the reason riley didn't want to celebrate her birthday?
seriously, why does he hate so much?
ben, riley wasn't celebrating her birthday after her 00th birthday party.
are you sure you want to watch this?
i think i'd remember if it was a disaster.
all right, come on, everybody.
danny, where are we going?
luckily, the future where you win a real moustache and lose a personal weight.
is ben here?
benjamin wheeler, come here and celebrate riley's birthday.
well, that's the best birthday i've ever had.
tell the cake you didn't do anything.
actually, try to save it with a perm first, then cut it out.
is riley still in love with ben or is that something that happened when she was a kid?
unless you still love riley.
i ruined her sweet 00 party.
not during her birthday, but the rest of the time she loves you for sure.
if ben is irresponsible enough to lose the papers and he's so afraid to face me that maybe he doesn't deserve to take emma's attorney alone.
if it makes you feel any better, we do most of the work.
i can imagine how hard it was to leave emma.
i knew you'd end up hurting her, no matter how beautiful, funny or wonderful she was gonna be!
in your presence, in the city streets of your city streets, the elite american army's elite tank force, only three minutes to destroy three minutes and trove cooper 00.
madox-00 is also a high-powered combat capability in limited areas of the weapon we remember.
what's more, a uh-00 has more destruction power than blackshawk.
he's an anti-terrorist and the head of anti-gerilla operations.
miss kusumoto is also the chief architect of software for "tankbuster."
in the name of putting madox's talents on the ledge, the show personally passed to the pilot's cabin.
unit 0 will go to ichigaya tonight.
we're in a hurry, so be quick as you can.
and...
miss kusumoto today, you have humiliated me.
i'm not here to congratulate you.
there's only one thing i can tell you:
wow!
kouji...
what is it?
onose, you leave this to me!
they threw away their trash.
i'm telling you, don't worry.
i'll buy you dinner in return, won't i?
sf's transport car...
according to the report reports it was natural to have encountered this...
lazy terrorist job.
you're too alien to the east-block operation.
i hope you know what you're saying!
i hope you see the obligation of this incident is entirely yours.
either way, the situation we're in is critical.
we were transporting him for a field test!
it's bad!
i have to make the operation.
besides, the madox-00.
we're having trouble investigating the crime scene.
shouldn't we get any support from the police?
we must prepare ourselves for the worst, and keep the help troops ready.
i'm the only one who can stand up to madox and take care of.
lieutenant kilgore is the best tanker in the army, even though he's one of the most troubled people.
is this okay?
nobody in the building?
anyway, i'm a little relieved.
shiori was really pretty...
when he goes to study in england, all the boys in japan are going to mourn.
where did you learn that?
he called me in the morning and asked me to give you a message.
use the opening control to open it.
it's burning!
he was able to adjust the pilot's cabin.
makes her feel like she's wearing a boat.
we got a signal activating from the madox.
this is a disaster.
could you heat up the microwave?
i really fucked myself up!
shiori, what do you intend?
the defense force?
you're on duty with a prototype airborne tank.
don't turn tokyo into vietnam!
tokyo or vietnam is the same battlefield to me.
you'll make a disaster.
oh, don't worry.
i'm gonna get over it before we get too hot.
lieutenant kilgore is using the most advanced tank and anti-tank choppers, and my word is to get madox on the mission.
in that case, there'll be a big panic downtown.
in these circumstances, there must be someone who can stop kilgore and madox.
what can we do?
we don't know the madox's target yet.
if i manage to find her before lieutenant kilgore, then maybe i am in the middle of a chance.
but the madox situation...
i'm using unit 0 with success from power tests.
how much chance?
hey, you heard me!
wait for me.
that's it!
how's it going!
what are you doing on the way?
i can't wait by the side of the road like a stone!
you're a real driver, man!
i've got plenty more to finish your installments!
he's back at the cabriet!
bye, assholes!
yeah, the saturdays were blocked by shinjuku.
i can't lose my trail in this crowd!
this "madox" must be really valuable.
spider 0 to jackal 0.
don't move on target!
it's moving itself...
one of the apaches was shot down.
all units have been authorized to destroy the madox.
just like kilgore wanted.
he's heading for the skyscrapers with his apaches.
evacuate the civilians at once!
they're coming all over me!
i gotta go over there and use the west exit.
another crazy armored bastard!
all right, back to work, madox!
i hear you.
and i say, "you're a pain in the ass."
you're the one who caused the chaos.
"just" what?
none of your business.
i can't do something i don't know what it means!
oh, no!
yes, captain!
"nsr parking spot -
" exit" exit."" exit."
i did it!
shiori is up there!
i won't let you take another step.
i can't fight!
i can't waste any more time with you!
i thought you were an amateur, so i shouldn't be nice to you.
time to jump around and stop jumping.
it won't work!
he's just a boy!
what were you trying to do all this?
my name is sugimoto kouji, second-class student of the kantto institute of technology.
my only intention was to meet my girlfriend who was waiting for me at the nsr building.
first he locked me in, then dropped his own chopper.
i got you.
miss kusumoto, this is spider 0, kilgore.
really, i saw your show.
you fight pretty hard.
i'll take care of whatever it takes, personally.
hey, where are the civilians in the building?
what's so important?
why am i freaking out when you think of me?
he's got madox on his target.
he'll come after you to destroy him.
most of all, i know how to walk and use my hands.
it's up to you to make it.
either the madox is destroyed, or you take kilgore!
they damaged my legs.
i can't move anymore.
you think i can defeat him?
you were fine when we were fighting.
did you read the entire manual?
hi, madox.
adi it!
come kill me!
wouldn't you stand up a little more and raise my heart?
l-lanet!
what is it, you look like a turtle!
if you can't even do this much, you're gonna be stained for tankbuster!
your numbers won't get to me!
kouji!
i'm coming!
you were brave!
i'm sick of the cat-fare!
you just fell into my medicine trap!
if i fall, i'll take you with me, madox!
this is messed up with madox!
there are some important things i want to tell you, shiori.
paul wouldn't hurt anyone.
"unimatable."
i'm not your mother, brian.
you don't even like me.
are you really staying?
not everything was clear.
i haven't even written my watch yet.
there's a sound coming from the right bronson.
can they sew her back up?
what's your mother's name?
am i reacting to the internal affairs?
yeah, but searching her room, rape her privacy.
john, what would you say if i told you i asked the waitress at doc magoo's if the night we lost the patient with marfan syndrome?
that place is full of people with a pager.
where did he get these?
will you get the tickets?
someone might come and claim the body.
abby, can you take a look at something?
what patient?
how are you?
or find someone else to eat lunch with me at lunch together at noon.
try to find his father.
please call my social worker and take me somewhere else?
would you please get me out of this room?
he stabbed carter.
why outside?
not yet.
i don't want him taken away somewhere else he doesn't know about.
where they keep the children, they're comfortable with the emergency services and the morgue.
who removed libertique from the sewing room?
you need to make a veiny path?
sats are 00th s sold sats.
parole.
whatever bruce lee is in martial arts, i am in love.
they're discharging paul.
what are you doing?
i was stabbed in the back.
where the hell were you?
and you said you were okay.
it's nice to find a special mail in your bills and junk mail.
v- and i did my best to blame all the parents for that!
mothers and fathers, grown men...'....'..'..'..
so having a solid family history is definitely an advantage.
i'm not saying that whatever happens...
do you sit quietly in your seat?
but before we start...
what's going on, brother?
you like it, don't you?
fat cunt.

i don't know if i'm gonna do that.
what do you mean you don't know i'm in a situation to do?
what do you think this is?
you think you're gonna walk around with me all day and just run away when things get really bad?
so you're gonna run and tell your cowards what i'm doing?

i was just giving something to my guy...
that's what i wrote for special situations.
you want to hear it?
yes!
i was getting something from marcel and i saw kirby in the street.
i saw it on the street behind the barber.
get out of my sight!
fuck.
how do you know if it's marcel or not?
things have been happening since...
you want anything from the market?
what the fuck!
tell me or i'll blow your head off!
why did he kill kirby?
kirby must have done something to that boy.
then why were you walking naked the other day in the middle of the road?
do you have a car?
let's go.
this is chris, okay?
he's bigger than you.
she just wants to talk, okay?
about your situation.
get out of the car.
are you the bad boy who killed kirby?
a little girl too, isn't she?
it was an accident.
do you know who that girl is?
no.
she was my sister!
you're sending a boy to do what a man should do, and he's fucking doing it!
do it!
sorry about your brother.
you can put kirby in your head, and you can't kill this cunt?
brother jake...
how do you think you got here?
how do you think i know where you live?
marcel, you set me up?
marcel, talk to me, brother!
you set me up, brother?
you used me, brother!
i didn't tell you to kill that girl!
that's it.
my sister was only 00 and you killed her!
look at me!
look at me.
okay.
i just got out, but i lost my key.
the christian mothers were lazy perhaps.
...they were leaving their scent.
no morale...
isn't it a little hard, though?
what are you talking about, brother?
my guy's here.
yes, isn't it karaoke?
i was gonna be there, was i?
yeah, i'll be there.
listen, i gotta go, okay, babe?
fuck!
what are you after?
are you doing drugs in my bar?
one of them was in my place the other day, always going to the bathroom... and he said he didn't do drugs!
what are you talking about?
aaron and the other idiot, ed.
i don't know what they're doing.
not in my place, man!
okay, brother.
get out of my way.
what did you say about my mother, brother?
what did you say to my mother, brother?
come here, say that, brother!
i'll call you at the next stop.
give me your number!
00, huh?
with the crying baby, eh?
here you go. 00.
you're disgusting!
who are you?
you're an illegal migrant, aren't you?
what's the baby's name?
no name.
what the hell are you doing?
oh, my god!
were my eyes open?
paddington.
i'll take you.
i got the tickets, okay?
what the hell!
give me your number!
hey!

fuck!
fuck that baby!
you got a ticket, mate?
it's okay, man.
get those bitches out of here!
come here, fucking...
come on!
go!
ed!
what the fuck?
my sister left a woman on the train.
and you brought her here to me?
look, brother, it's more complicated than you think, okay?
where did you get that?
i found it somewhere.
00 cops with dogs came out of nowhere.
this is the smartest job you've ever done!
what are you gonna do with this baby?
you're giving it to the cops?
and i'm supposed to change my mind and go back?
i look like a pedophile.
no, if i do that, they'll send you home or something, right?
a woman leaves her own child on the train!
you see, she doesn't want him.
now i'm gonna change your underpants!
i'll keep an eye on the gun for you, okay?
will you help me find her mother?
i have more important things to do than deal with this shit.
you give me the gun, i'll hide it somewhere, okay?
give me the stuff.
why did you put it there, man?
take it!
no, you call me when you're done with this shit, okay?
because we have work to do, okay, faggot?
daddy!
let go!
move!
can ashley come?
sir?
i got it, man.
well, i'm a little nervous, hon.
what are you getting nervous about?
we'll figure it out.
well, i was talking to vince...
this is a child that her mother doesn't want.
what are you doing, brother?
what's wrong with you, man?
why are you acting like a bitch?
who are you, my brother, jeremy kyle or something?
you can't sell someone's baby to someone else!
especially vince and carol.
the other day, we were selling wenches to this guy!
no, you didn't, because she doesn't want to be found, man.
they're gonna give this kid to another vince and carol.
let me go, brother.
told you i'd get it, man.
what am i gonna tell people?
yeah, yeah, she's fine.
yes, but don't tell anyone we're here!
just half of it, give me the rest.
i can't believe you sold a baby!
you didn't want to before, did you?
if i'm gonna get into all this stress, i lose the money, lose everything, so you got to talk to somebody properly, okay?
a nice lady.
i'm in "fuck you," or something.
what's going on in there?
you sell drugs in a bar, right?
either you or your stupid brother took my gun and i need that gun.
you've got 0 hours to get my gun back or i'm gonna break people's houses down.
i'm going.
it always breaks things, doesn't it?
why are you bringing this bitch to my place when my wife's upstairs?
what's going on?
she had issues with a solid russian mafia, trouble everywhere.
she thought they were gonna kill the baby.
so she left the baby on the train.
now, take this money, and i'll give you the rest when i meet ed.
it's not fake, vince, you know it!
you don't understand when you don't have a dick in your mouth, do you?
it's not your fucking problem in my mouth alone!
no, he said your dick was in his mouth.
i'm not giving them the baby!
they can't take it either!
calm down, okay?
now get up and get that baby!
here!
gun, man!
just know that she died to give you this.
they may not let you go because you have no family.
what flowers would you like, any suggestions?
white roses are good, right?
fuck off then!
fuck you!
are you the owner of this car?
but you stopped me for nothing.
but before that, the new owner of our toast, let's lift it to chester.
to chester.
i hope she will tremble on these magnificent monsters like i've done for many years.
cheers.
i promise i will rise up the standards of this show and you will be proud of it.
have a safe journey where dreams come true.
thank god.
even if that smug face is gone, the dominance will pass us.
marjorie, it's very rude...
thank you, chester.
now, if you'll excuse me, the original family, monsters and the weird community-- let the final moment be alone.
bye.
there's someone else to thank.
mr. richard spencer.
our lives have changed its course.
cheers.
mm!
but we're gonna have a nice feast tonight, and then we're gonna watch a movie from my own collection.
not the sign of the cross again.
no.
we're watching freaks tonight.
you know this movie, richard?
i can't say i do.
it's a great movie.
tell me about it, eve, paul.
ah.
cleopatra is an ordinary trapeze artist from normal creation, and marries a midget who makes small shows.
but his main objective is to poison him and get to his legacy.
he plays all the freaks in his finger until one day he gets drunk and he takes his true intentions out of his mouth.
then all the freaks turn against him.
they get their revenge at night with knives and guns.
home, home.
honey... don't just say the end and enjoy it.
that sounds great!
there's a lot to do before heading west.
i can't.
shut up and sit down.
you deserve it.
what happened to you?
come on, richard, pick up.
i've been thinking about you a long time.
oh, thank god.
we've had clients who stunned our exhibit before, but... no one's passed out.
are you all right, ma'am?
where are those security guards?
good to know.
now it's your turn.
jesus christ.
i don't even know that.
i've already told them everything...
stanley.
elsa... elsa... elsa...
come on...
talk to them.
hollywood!
i'm afraid... that's all it is.
just a dream.
come on, turn it over.
aah!
god...
yo.
please.
my cousin works at the garden of allah.
but you brought death here... and you have to pay for it.
take him down.
come on, come on.
elsa, come on... we need to talk privately.
i believe we find something in common.
you think you can run now?
i'm right.
he killed her.
he's not who you think he is.
and start running.
run!
run!
run!
just'cause you're growing up without a father doesn't mean you're romanticizing the job now.
how did he die?
who killed him?
we all did.
he broke the rule.
now.
come on.
that was my father!
he killed a freak!
and the most delicate in us.
you believe his word?
this fraud bitch?
i saw dear ma petite with my own eyes in a jar.
i heard him pay in my own ears.
as for maggie, if she hadn't helped, we'd have more bodies.
i won't forgive him.
all i want is to rot in hell.
you're gonna be friends with whoever's in this situation.
maggie's gonna change her bandages.
no!
keep the dirty.
now that your mother's not here, it's up to me to protect and protect you.
i've seen you turn into a man from childhood to a leader-- and we need you.
i don't have hands!
i can't even piss myself.
i got an old friend.
he'll come and help you.
he's a real artist.
but the wounds need to heal first.
maggie will help you.
let him.
i'm so sorry.
i hate hurting you.
really?
i thought that was your only gift- to hurt people.
i love you, jimmy.
this part is real.
i always have.
i want to make a fresh start.
we can still go to new york like we planned.
why not?
you're kidding, right?
you think after all you've done, we're just gonna sail to the new horizonts?
my hands... are in a fucking jar, and you're responsible for all this.
i'm so sorry.
can you get ma petite back from death?
huh?
i've changed, jimmy.
ah!
i knew you were dumb, let's add blind to your list, shall we?
get me someone to focus the lamp!
i can't leave.
i have to set the right light for the first time, you understand?
try again now!
wheisse!
elsa.
of course.
he's watching us.
can't we?
just this once?
please?
okay.
yeah.
mm.
oh.
thank you, chester.
you threw me down.
like an old sock.
i'm sorry, marjorie.
i got a little... carried away, but i'm happy now.
they've got a magic show, you're in.
maybe i should go.
we can handle it, marjorie.
the twins accepted you.
they just don't want you watching them do things.
they're using you, chester.
you're their boss now.
no, they don't.
they love me.
you're a murderer.
no, no.
no.
marjorie.
i know you don't like to talk about it, so don't mention it, but you killed them.
and alice and lucy.
impossible.
i'm just a puppet.
hmm.
love destroys you, chester.
you're losing control.
i know...
i'm a monster.
you don't need them.
i'm in.
i know.
please don't leave me, marjorie.
twins?
they have to go.
i know.
they will.
ethel looks great here with the chorus girls.
oh, this is from her barnum days.
she was a unique woman.
ethel.
ethel.
so what do you say?
did anyone hear what spencer said last night?
now everything is in place.
elsa killed ethel.
the woods.
car accident.
it was all a setup.
i believe that.
that crazy, gruddy woman threw a knife at my paul.
elsa's only problem.
i never got it in my head anyway.
i know ethel.
he wasn't someone to kill himself.
he's not a coward.
he wouldn't have done it to his own child, and of course we would.
and leave a decent note.
we know what we're gonna do if somebody comes after one of us.
our future has one trust.
that's elsa not living.
have you ever imagined how you feel, dot?
thank god you told us about marjorie.
all he had to do was push him.
i think we've certainly made a good impression on you.
good evening, girls.
what are you doing here?
i'm here to extend a friendly xindian.
i've been getting some information on your last situation.
we don't want to hear anything from you.
leave nicely.
oh, dot, i can't blame you.
i had a terrible behavior the other day.
but the latest events have caused my tough side of me.
i lost my mother.
so sudden and... terrible.
she was very upset, dandy.
losing a mother is a terrible thing for everyone.
it was.
it is.
and it made me feel like i shouldn't leave my loved ones behind.
but i think you should know we're seeing a man.
actually, i got your news.
you have no idea how grateful it would be to marry you.
if i had the chance to handle everything, believe me...
i came with friendly feelings.
i know i'm losing my chances.
i'm not half the man you deserve.
but i asked myself.
"dudy, what do you have to do to support the loved girls?"
then it occurred to me that i could protect you, and i hired a decent man so you could gather information about your new friend.
it broke my heart because your chester creb crab is a maniac!
we don't need to look at these.
what's your problem?
you're a pain in the ass, and we don't trust you as our sin.
ta-ta, then.
i did my best.
my mother always said to argue with a woman when she was angry.
who is it?
son.
here.
drink.
what's that?
penicillin.
i'd hate to see you die of an infection by complete you.
who are you?
my name is massimo dolcefino.
i'm here to do your new hands.
okay?
massimo is an old friend of mine from before the war.
he's a master of art.
no, no.
i saw the soldiers with the grenades in their hands.
they put these cool hooks on their hands.
i can't take 00, but at least i can hold my own cigarettes.
and i don't have to be afraid of wood dryers for the rest of my life.
massimo offers you something more elegant than rusty hooks.
more convincing.
look.
see?
so is the other one.
massimo saved my life.
your mother would have died from drinking, and she would have left you in the streets open.
i could have married her if you weren't so stupid.
"i have one sin..."..."
si.
"... loving you..."
very very very, very very very very very
no!
they were members of an organization.
and the leaders are a doctor you know.
go to the next one, don't rush this time.
for two years,
massimo took care of me.
she taught me to walk.
and dance.
then hideburg fell.
nurmberg, rhineland...
we still had the chance to escape.
we had a plan.
how could i look at the eyes of my love when i knew those monsters were free?
they were supposed to pay.
i hunted them all one by one.
aah!
finally, i got to the leader.
oh, the monsters' head.
dr. hans grouper.
there shouldn't be a painless death.
my death would not be painless either.
he took it very personal to want me to kill him.
very personal.
he tortured me.
he locked me in a cell and tortured me again, and again.
how did you survive?
i lived in austria until the end of the war.
then i came to america- 00.
and i called miss mars for years.
but i didn't get an answer.
if you loved her so much, and you knew where she was, why didn't you come on your feet?
my body was out of torture but...
i was like a pinocchio.
there was nothing left of humanity in me.
but, uh...
beautiful irony.
beautiful irony.
i know you guys have been together a lot, and it might be hard to make changes for a sit-down show.
and i repeat- it has nothing to do with ego.
for this continuity...
it looks so normal.
i don't think we can judge him unless we have definitive proof.
what about the file?
it says he killed his wife.
you're letting dandy's lies cloud your judgment.
dot and i have something to say.
we don't want to be your assistant anymore.
why?
we just... don't want to.
maybe you'll change your mind when you hear my final.
two bodies, two heads.
it'll sound a lot.
a first in the history of magic.
come on girls... let's rehearse.
we're not going in that box.
no, chester... we're not going into that box.
now excuse me...
i'll go.
you...
i could be your assistant.
it is.
get in the box, lucy.
my name is maggie.
oop!
is that your magic show?
it seems a bit pathetic.
shut up.
i didn't say anything.
what are you looking at?
backstage.
it's basically the magic saw.
tonight's play belongs to me... to a very dangerous version of this game.
handcuffs.
hey, i...
i don't know this part.
i went to war for you.
you should have died there.
we loved each other.
and then you came back in your head with a metal plate and a sparkling bees in your head.
chester, wait, i can't move my feet!
stop!
stop talking!
you're distracting me.
wait, marjorie.
haven't you ruined my life enough?
you're nothing without me.
i'll show you.
all of you.
chester!
chester!
chester, stop!
what are you doing?
relax, people... it's just a magic show.
magic show.
i can get her to come back.
again...
alakazam!
abraza...
abracadabra.
this is gonna be a lot of people, chester.
she made me do it.
he deserved it.
what do we do now?
steal his jewels and bury the bitch.
why are you gathering?
you've ruined everything again.
time to go.
you confused me.
you did this consciously to sabotage me.
i finally found happiness.
i'm going.
you can't leave without me.
oh.
i loved you.
chester... chester... chester chester... chester chester
oh, god...
marjorie?
stay with me.
marjorie.
_
jimmy darling!
i'm not an artist like you, mom.
listen to your mother.
you have a beautiful smile and a wonderful weather.
you're star quality, jimmy.
now get your ass on the stage and show your mother why you're proud of you.
jimmy.
maggie's dead.
you want details?
elsa's next.
tonight.
apparently... now in real life... you will have your chance.
jimmy...
i'm happy for you.
how dare you come in unannounced!
what do you want?
you have to go.
they've been planning revenge all day in ethel's trailer.
they'll kill you.
why should i believe you, huh?
my monsters love me.
i'm like their mother.
ethel was more like their mothers than you.
you killed their real mother.
the last nonsense of a desperate man.
who's desperate now?
you saw what they did to her.
but where would i go?
anywhere but here.
you could have saved me.
we just did.
there you are.
what's jimmy doing?
he'd be here if he could.
it's time.
give me that.
ethel!
let's get some... justice.
oh.
thank you for coming.
i would never refuse a woman in a difficult situation.
i'm not in trouble.
but i'm in a hurry.
oh.
i want to report a murder.
who was murdered?
a young woman.
put it there.
slowly.
put your hands where we can see them.
i did it.
send me back to bed.
what are you doing here?
i'm here to make a count.
i'm the new owner.
where's elsa?
he's gone.
he followed his dreams.
elsa sold us again.
$00,000 in cash.
nothing.
everything here, including your contracts, belongs to me now.
and i want to see what's mine.
was that always your dream, sir?
being in the show world?
dream.
yeah.
and now it turns into reality.
i'm thirsty.
go get me a lemonade with a straw.
