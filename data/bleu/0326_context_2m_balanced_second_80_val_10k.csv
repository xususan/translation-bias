wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a
we can't leave your dad here
mr. tremont, why don't you come with us and sit inside?
i'll think about
ralph, we've given you all the privileges we've given you, and now we're predicting our wife is less than 00 percent less than yours right now, right now
how can you be so sure of yourself?
you-you've never been up to a job like this before.
and if you're wrong, we're gonna be the laughing mask of your industry and we're never gonna be able to
forget about running the tune-up factory.
every minute he's made it open, the place he's on is worth at least $00 million a million
how can you be so sure of $00 million?
we might be able to offer him a little on $00 million by offering
any word on back up?
can i get back to my subject now?
we don't have a problem with the real artisan's real value of $00 million around $00 million and
they're able to take over all the overhead overhead, but the plan we have to show that we've got 00% of our executive personnel out of our jobs in just
isn't that enough just to sell
that's the way the accounting records get used to deal with
if this works out well, there's no need for that
i don't think they're focused on that
we can change that. we can
the other thing is food wholesale sales, ...it's a good sector in a long-
now, our plans for cash flowing in our department seem to be moving but not satisfactory.
all in consideration, we have no problem taking credit at the banks taken from the banks.
yeah, that looks good, that seems
johnny, what's going on out there?
well, dad, we're gonna get a salmon fish can get a canned
i didn't know you knew anything about something like that you knew about
actually, i don't know,
the guy who came to us for the money doesn't know
we're just gonna get the company and then we're gonna put an end
this your job?
you buy companies, then close up?
my work is a little complicated, daddy,
we're picking up this concerto factory in this case.
and then the company's a terrible
this third generation is taking over, and their production in a terribly terribly terribly disgrace
but they have a small shell of shell companies, and that's what it's all for
the factory is built on a property that is near the sea
so we buy the factory, close it off, then we switch over to the paravanow company, then we sell the land and then we sell the land.
have you ever thought of running these companies?
there's no money in that, dad
the world has changed, johnny johnny johnny johnny
you can't believe how the world has changed.
when you were a little boy, you used to go to work for me at lockeheed, remember?
i'd cut them off from their shells and grab them
they'd pay 00 cents a day, and i'd buy some cheesy cheesy cheese sand
you used to say you wanted to work there with me when you grew up with me, out there,
but now what you do now is buy your job and then close her up
dad, did you hear anything about those guys from lockeheed?
rick malinson???
tommy williams?
they all moved out and they all moved out
the valley, palm springs...
there was no one there to say goodbye to me
the next morning, ...there wasn't someone there who did what i do
the world split into two groups:
...work and the bosses and bosses.
i don't know, dad, i
everything's okay, johnny johnny johnny johnny johnny
there's nothing wrong here there's
i'm a worker, that's all.
but you're different, you're
you like being in control.
you like to take responsibility take responsibility.
you're a fucking boss.
mom?
what do you think?
okay, dad dad
"if you hit a parked vehicle and not find the owner...
why are you doing this?

very good very good
thank thank thank you than
we've come all this way this
i don't want to see something go wrong now, i

jake tremont?

you can't sit here during the test, sir, sir,
oh, i'm sorry, sorry
oh, you can't stay in the car, too
what are you talking about?
this is my father father my father

mario was a wonderful student, mother mother mom.
he graduated from physics through physics.
he didn't even read a book, end a shalap
yeah, but all the good students also read me a book, and they ended up with me a bunch of fucking
but john john was a good student, but john

there's a couple of kids from school
they're so similar, they have
this, uh, this is good,
yeah, fun, but believe it or not, you're gonna want to work one day, bill bill.
lying on the coasts of mexico is not gonna do you any good

i'm going back to new york soon, and i want to make this right.
what does your mom think?
she thinks i should be able to make my own decision myself,
i'm not sure how i feel about that, how i feel
we need to talk about this a little bit more about
i don't understand why i don't
we've never talked about this before, and i know what i want.
johnny, something's wrong, something's wrong.
can you come here and take a look?
that's enough, mr. tremontontont
you can get dressed if you like.
is she okay?
yeah, good good, good
there's a troubling process going
it hasn't spread yet
any idea what the problem is?
it could be one of a few things
i suspect there were cyanists in his bladder.
the problem is, is whether she's all right
is this going to come out on your tests?
not completely, not
it's not a good sign that he
so it's serious?
i think we should put him through a general operation.
if it was serious, dad, they wouldn't have let you go
they'd come right in, and they'd operate right underneath the
i wouldn't be really surprised if it's
i don't think we should tell mother about this.
why would you worry if there's nothing there?
whatever you say, johnny johnny johnny what you
you're the boss the boss
she told you, didn't she?
of course she did, of course
then you know it's nothing serious, it's nothing serious,
if it wasn't serious, you should have told me that yourself.
look, mom, you need to stay away from this possible stress right now.
you're gonna get upset about the whole
that's why i didn't tell you
he says it's just a cyst cyst cy
that's right
it was going to be a simple operation
yeah, that's right
mom, i'd tell you if anything went wrong, i'd
i'm sure
ok ok ok
is this the way i'm gonna walk around here, john, and i'm gonna walk around here like all the nurses here
yes y y
that's what it says here in the ad
"no more time."
let's go to
you need to sign this, dad,
what is that?
i don't have any baseball gloves.
bad joke was a bad j
dr. santana has prepared these meds for this
it'll just make you comfortable.

no no no no
are you comfortable, dad?
fine.
i'll let you get some rest and rest
that stuff's gonna make you sleep like a
ok ok ok
don't forget, if you need anything, just ring that bell.
that's all,
you'll be fine.
you know, john, i see some guys, they're hugging each other, they see each other,
we've never hugged a hug.
shall we give it a try?
come on come come
i love you, johnny johnny johnny.
i love you too, dad dad
well, mr. tremont, i'm afraid it

we ran into a bunch of bad-nasty tumors.
father's not a 00-year-old at
well, this is gonna be a ridiculous question, but are you absolutely sure about this?
yes y y
the good thing is we can get to him and destroy it.
listen, dr. santana santana sant
whatever you do, don't tell my dad it's cancer
he's very freaked out and he's very afraid
say something more reasonable.
take it easy, mr. tremontont
you'd be surprised what others have been through.
kids don't even care about that for their kids.
i'm not taking this lightly, doctor.
i just want to tell her that personally, that's all.
it's cancer, isn'
mom, i told you, i told you,
it's just a cyst and they're gon
i want to see her.
mom! mother
mom, you can't see him right now,
will you listen to me?
you shouldn't be subjected to this kind of stress stress
if everything's all right, let me see him if you let me see him
oh, come on, mama!
john just wants your own good back only for the best
you know you know you
you have to listen to him, mother mom.
he's my husband and i'm gonna see him

it's exactly exactly the same as the other patients.
they often go into shock after every simple operation too often after a simple
is this standard?
do you know what's going on inside?
i know this is a frightening experience for you, but what you need to understand here is a state of senility here.
she didn't get sen hadn
why is she senile now?
d senility is an odd thing to end up being
and she comes and goes
a stress like this sudden stress suddenly disappear suddenly suddenly.
i'm sure she'll be okay with a good rest and medication and med
what do we do in the meantime?
nothing at nothing at
what do you mean "noth nothing"?
we wait for him to respond to medication.
did you tell dad it had cancer?
she has the right to know that's the
i don't know exactly what it is you want me to do, mr. tremont, mr. tremont
dr. ethridge, dr.
i don't trust santana.
you're the hospital manager, and what i'd like to say is that she does not comfort us.
santana's a good young surgeon at dr sant
apparently, she's treating your father perfect and professionally and professionally, perfectly
i told him not to let him never tell my dad that he had cancer 'cause he's too afraid of
but what he did, he just went out and told him to tell him
yeah, it's hard for any doctor to say that for
he's forced to balance the rights of your father's ability to provide information with the members of his family
i'm sure he didn't have a
she had an option with an option.
he should have listened to my word.
i know my father my father my father
why did you tie his arms?
so he wouldn't hurt
he was hitting himself with his hands
well, then, i'm her son and i think she doesn't need these things to be
let us know when you're ready, and we'll put her back in bed.
i can't believe this i can
hey, dad, how's it
does he always look like that?
look, hey, look, look, i brought annie.
and billy's here and billy billy
hey, dad
how are you feeling, dad?
can you hear me?
hey, grandpa, it's me, billy billy
how's it going
god, john, i can't stand being here when she looks like that.
i think that's enough of that'
i've given him an excuse.
that'll calm her down.
how long has she been like this?
the whole time we've been here this whole
seemed depressed?
god, doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor
good thing you're not a detective.
yeah, he seemed depressed, seemed depressed
what the hell is going on here?
i meant, uh, was there anything unusual that i meant, mr. tremont, to be
mr. tremont- mr.
don't keep telling me that his condition is unusual, doctor doctor
this extraordinary depression is not unusual, it's true, but the sedative is going to bring him back on his own.
a sedative?
the man's hallucinating.
he keeps screaming and y
she doesn't know any family, and you just gave her a sedative?
why didn't you give him some bake?
maybe his throat hurts too!
we decided to release your father tomorrow morning.
you can come and pick her up after 00:00, after 00:00,
what do you mean, "taburcu"?
you want to tell me my dad's cured?
well, of course not, but in medicine, there's nothing we can do to him.
we can't hold the beds for patients who can't help medically medically medically in a way that
how do we know?

mr. tremont, this whole thing you've done here is very un

mr. tremont?
i understand you brought your father back to the hospital.
yes y y
i thought it would be difficult for you to care for her at home at home
it's no place for her right now.
she can't do it at home and she can't here, can she
maybe it'd be better if he just kept hiking a helicopter up the hill
it's hard to accept the children's parents grow old, i know, it's
or what that means?
i know what it's like to get old
mr. tremont, don't forget that doctors also are human
we can't handle all the problems.
we can't save every patient we can
we're living in a system where old people eventually fall into trouble.
what is your request?
why are you here?
there's another doctor in this hospital in this hospital
i think he's better than dr. santana than dr. santana
what?
i'm kicking and saying everything that's said and
he's a good man,
i'd like your father to take a look at his
mr. tremont?
mr. tremont?
how do you do, mr. tremontont
let's do a few more inspections
let's just get an eeg and we'll trace the metabolic ab
give her calcium-matnisium and let's run vital function tests and vital function tests.
i'm not sure what caused this, but i'm now diagnose that as it is a result of epilepsy.
the question is, what caused this?
and why isn't she conscious
if you'd like to have another consultation about this, please do so.
no, that won't be necessary.
well, like we say, don't think we're gonna sit around and do nothing.
we don't think we don't
so far, we've done a series of tests and we're gonna do more and more
so far all we've done is shoot into the darkness.
i appreciate your modesty, doctor doctor.
but these tests have been done a long time, haven't they?
she's gonna sleep here for a little while longer, so we're gonna monitor her from the monitor any minute we
and i'm gonna check her out and visit her twice a day
i'm not gonna leave you alone until he's better
i'm afraid that's completely against hospital rules.
how long can you take this?
i don't
i go once a day once a day
i'm sitting up
i'm talking to him
i'm talking to what's
i think if i sit there and i talk, he won't die, he won't
what will you do if he dies?
annie, i don't-
you're the only one who can't accept that, john
why don't you let him go?
i can't explain it to you that
maybe i should be there when it comes to the end of
i don't
to prove he's still here.
to prove i was his son to prove that i was
so what have you done positive?
annie, this guy got up every day of his life to work he never liked.
we never asked him.
he did it because he was the father and he had no other choice.
she didn't ask herself to please herself or happy to be happy or happy with herself or
she never knew if she had the right or she had
the result of this choice, we have to look at it and take care of him when he's
but i messed this up for messed
john john john
i'm embarrassed against him, but my mother took over him.
she's just getting old, and
i'm sad because i had a marriage that went bad, a job that doesn't make sense, a job that i would barely recognize if i passed on the street and i barely know a son.
maybe this is going to be very difficult for
but i'll be there for you when you die
and i'm gonna kiss her, and i'm gonna cover her up, and cover her
...and then i'll mark the gold that i'm there at that moment
i owe this to him i o
when did you get into town?
i've never been. never
i'm staying with some friends.

yes, mr. tremontontont
how can we make you feel comfortable?
you can start with these pipes over me with the wires on me.
and then i'd better have something to eat later.
will you starve me here?
okay, we'll just have to take a little slow
remember, you haven't eaten for a long time.
maybe that's why i'm in this
have you thought about that?
all the tests are positive, vital signs of life stable, all
and that's the profile of a healthy human
i've seen people come out of coma before, i
we don't usually find the cause,
i've got some theories about that i have
that's why i can't say
like what?
