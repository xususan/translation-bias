michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, it was with his younger brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think us sleeping together is working out.
yeah, i miss mom.
i can tell.
i'm supposed to write 200 words on the morality of war... whether a preemptive strike is ever justified.
i'm not sure if my ethics teacher would love if i cheated on my essay.
well, you just passed my ethics test.
[narrator] in fact, george michael had developed a hopeless crush... on his ethics teacher, a woman named beth baerly.
even minor crimes are punishable... by brutally chopping off the offender's hand.
no ring.
try to remember everything she says about me, all right?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
did you and dad adopt a child?
the s.e.c. was onto us.
your father thought it would make us look charitable.
he must have forged my signature.
well, maybe i'll get a son who will... finish his cottage cheese.!
you've got to get me out of this.
i'll call social services, but you must take buster back.
but i'm not taking care of him either.
i don't have the milk of mother's kindness in me anymore.
hello.
{ gob] michael.
i've got a couple of girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
so we had a little disagreement.
i'm offering you an olive branch here.
yeah-yeah.
besides, when was the last time you slept with someone?
[narrator] meanwhile, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
well, i don't know why i'm telling you this.
i guess there's just some things you can't really say to your dad.
[narrator] lindsay believed that george michael wanted to fix up his father... so he could fill the role ofhis mother.
there's nothing wrong with that.
although, i must say i'm a little hurt that you haven't considered me.
aunts can fill that role.
teachers can fill that role.
and, someday, you're gonna find the right woman to fill that role.
but until then, i'll be right across the hall.
[narrator] lindsay had never been more proud of anything she had said in her entire life.
[narrator] meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to show up.
this is shannon, the girl i've been telling you all about.
girl, indeed... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and so she's your date.
"oh... { laughs] ""nagarma,"" you've got a mustache."
i mean, you've got a milk mustache.
yeah.
[narrator] but gob mistook michael's basic human decency for romantic interest... and felt a competitive urge to step in.
because, you know, it's beyond adorable... and e-exotic.
i find you very attractive.
{ nazhgalia, michael, shannon] really?
[narrator] and george sr. was about to get a surprise visitor.
i've studied all your teachings, and i've purchased every tape.
and i watch 'em over and over.
[narrator] george sr. had recently marketed a line of self-help tapes... touting his newly discovered spirituality.
i've also lost four pounds on your low-carb bluth banana jail bars. { giggles]
i've come to learn at your feet.
that's a good place to start.
[narrator] and michael, free ofhis double date, met lindsay at parent-teacher night.
hey, linds, is it my imagination... or does this rape room have the same floor plan as our kitchen?
well, i think she's perfect for you.
you'd think that would turn him off to the entire concept.
besides, i'm not gonna rush out and marry somebody just because you think my son would like it.
i'm ms. baerly, the ethics teacher.
my goal is to teach your children about the preciousness oflife... that can be lost by the mindless pulling of a trigger.
[narrator] and so michael got to know his son's ethics teacher.
"i guess that's the ""rrrr"" of it."
you know, so frustrating.
i mean, they just threw this class at me after mr. daniels had a stroke.
thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing 'cause you were laughing.
"""rrrr!"" - { laughs] ""rrrr!"""
but, you know, l-l...
and i think i'm an ethical person.
right.
here's an ethical question.
can-can a parent take a teacher out for a drink?
or...
yeah, she died.
well, it's the mr. daniels stroke thing...
let's go get that drink.
yeah, it could only help.
[narrator] george sr. was dealing with his own admirer.
oh, i've already told you so many of my sins.
maybe you could tell me some of yours.
uh, well, there are legal implications to that.
but, uh, back to your sins.
uh, do that one about the, uh... { takes deep breath] ladies' shower... in your college dorm again.
[narrator] and michael was on his way to what would be his second date...
michael, the little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with him.
at least, i think it's a him.
you've got to strip them down to next to nothing before you can even tell.
yeah, mom.
they will take him back.
shoes on, mister.!
shoes on.!
he's out of control.
who's that?
"this is ""annyong,"" who your father and i have adopted."
what, i'm gone for a couple days and you find a new son?
[narrator] lucille could see that her son was concerned, even jealous.
and she knew how it felt to be overlooked.
annyong is your brother now.
call it off.
i'm keeping him.
look, i gotta call you back.
sweet ride.
are you making dinner reservations?
"a ""little korean"" dropped off."
[narrator] and after their date...
michael took a step he hadn't taken in years.
okay, do you think this is a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mmm.
such a good idea.
but how are we going to sneak in without waking everyone up?
this may not have been my best idea.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but it looks like we're even.
you took something i liked.
i took something you liked.
"i... { beeps]...""nashbagerlajam."""
listen, i know that you've been trying to get even with me about marta.
i was lying when i said i wasn't gonna to sleep with her, so...
she'd have to agree to it.
i don't anticipate a problem with that.
right.
i just slept with one.
again, didn't like nazhgalia.
really, and good luck getting rid of her.
not a problem.
oh, so romantic.
"who's ""n. bahn-ahden?"""
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something before, but i didn't know if it was real.
but now, uh... your ethics teacher...
yeah, i just made this for her.
oh.
she loves saddam hussein.
i'm sure she is interested in him... as a subject, you know.
i'm sure she doesn't love saddam.
you know, i just wanted to make her something special to show that i care.
about the class?
you mean, you love her like...
hi, george michael.
i'm gonna go home and think about it.
i'm gonna go home, think about it.
dad, what was she doing here?
[narrator] michael knew he had an ethical responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yes.
your uncle gob slept with her.
well, why would he do that?
why would gob sleep with my ethics teacher?
you and i know that, but gob he just...
he's not that exact of a target shooter, and he just kind of sprays it everywhere.
you know, but listen, did-did you really think that-that... that you had a...
i mean, she's kinda old for you, don't you think?
we don't even know how old she is.
no one does.
she was chaperoning the diversity dance... and i thought maybe as a joke, i'd go up to her and be, like...
"""well, hey, do you want to dance?"""
"and she'd be, like, ""ah, what the heck?"" right?"
i did it differently in the mirror, but...
but, you know, like, we'd be joke dancing or something.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should be taking somebody your own age?
like your cousin.
i defaced a rare book to get that picture of saddam hussein in a bathing suit.
"""what would saddam do?"""
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that is our exact outdoor fire pit.
[narrator] at prison, george sr. was preparing for an evening with his most devoted fan.
while cindi lightballoon was making preparations ofher own.
how we doin'?
[man] we have video.
[narrator] so george michael, still angry at gob... sought out the family expert on making trouble.
i know he was dating that girl shannon.
the cheerleader?
yeah, she's probably gonna take him to that stupid diversity dance.
i wish i had someone shocking to take.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and asked him... but he got all out of breath and dropped the phone.
i never heard back.
you know, may-maybe we should go together.
right, i mean, it's a bad example...
hello.
my mom bought him.
she's making me register him for school.
he's my new little brother.
so we're related.
[narrator] and michael went to discuss the george michael situation with ms. baerly.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
you mean, you're interested in him.
this is what i want to talk to you about, though.
but i've enjoyed my time with you.
you ever wanna talk ethics...
you see, george michael made this poster for you.
you know, he-he kind of, uh, is in love with you, so...
he knows we're going out.
i told him that you slept with my brother.
that may be the most unethical thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been doing this half a semester.
look, it was a preemptive strike.
my brother would've tried to sleep with you.
well, i want you to leave right now and not come back.
i understand.
starting right now.
[narrator] george sr. went on a walk with cindi.
george.
and she was getting to him.
you can feel safe to fully reveal yourself to me.
{ sighs] it's weighing heavy on my soul.
you, uh...
he's pinching the camera.
so, it's off with mother now.
[narrator] in fact, lucille was just giving annyong and maeby a ride.
you're trying to steal from the wrong man.
watch your back, my little immigrant friend!
[narrator] and the spring diversity dance was in full swing.
whoa, sorry.
so you're not letting him in because he doesn't share your perfectly shaped nose... your round eye-shaped eyes, your strong square jaw.
you wanna dance?
all right!
[narrator] and gob sought out shannon...
who had found out he had cheated on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
oh, hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
look, i blew it, okay?
beth.!
um, i blew it okay?
i had to see you.
l-i've been giving this a lot of thought, and-and...
oh, that's... that's your definition of the right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing at a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girl.
yeah, my ethics teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
i'm really touched that you'd stick up for me after i've been so horrible to you.
[narrator] in fact, gob mistook the civics teacher... for the ethics teacher michael was dating.
man, he... has a type.
gob, mrs. whitehead was the civics teacher.
two strikes.
l-i've been seeing ms. baerly, and i should never have brought gob into it.
but that day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never wanted to hurt you.
i didn't know you were that serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
i'm just saying someday, you know.
i'm not really into kids.
the lady said no, man.
look, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean we had some laughs about some very sad things, but...
i don't think we have a future.
and, jeremy, i will take that cupcake.
hey, uh, you wanna dance?
i can't believe that would have worked.
on the next arrested development.
buster's competition heats up.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.!
we are not allowed to have candles in here.
mom would freak.
oh, no, it's fine.
i'll light a candle of my own.
that's exactly what i'll do.
you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, that's all right.
really, it is.
you want me to help you out with this?
no problem.
here, let me just help you out here.
these, too?
okay, here, let me get that for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're proposing, connie, is, to say the very least, extreme.
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
move, move, move!
what are you doing?
get off me.
i don't wanna die.
we all gotta go sometime, huh?
four months ago, each of you little piggies attended auditions to be on a never-before-seen reality tv game show.
and guess what?
you won.
i think, in life, some people are meant to be on tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm totally off-the-hook gay and proud of it.
you're a cutie, aren't you?
i wanna lead our country.
next question.
my name is angel, on loan from england.
me, too.
he's my brother stanton/parole officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother dropped him on his head.
and he doesn't know.
well, but i do.
"dixon, 6'2"", 200 pounds."
you know, people used to say i look like will smith.
now they say barack obama.
to win $20,000 each, all you have to do is spend one night in a prison.
that abandoned prison.
whoa.
holy shit!
cool.
how come i've never heard of this show?
like, how do we know this is not some sort of frat house prank?
right.
this is actually our third show, but we won't be on-air until the fall.
and as for knowing if this is anything more than a college prank, you'll just have to play for the money to find out.
you'll be asked to perform a series of tasks.
tasks that will test your nerves, your courage and your sanity.
sounds like fun, right?
what kind of task are we talking about, dawg?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i can't have no girl do this while i take off.
i have to look after my baby sister.
i'm in.
you guys are insane.
do any of you know the history of that prison?
some really fucked up shit went down in there.
like what?
stick around.
you'll find out.
the total money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if all of you make it through the night, there will be a substantial bonus.
ain't enough money in the world to make me stay in that place.
anybody else wanna join him?
not me.
well, there's no way i'm riding all the way back to the city with urine boy.
oh, i'm in.
just get me the hell out of here.
your chariot awaits.
unlock him.
bye.
you guys are idiots.
this is for some fucking frat party joke and you're all gonna be made fun of.
you're all gonna look like a bunch of losers.
can't you just see this video playing at a party?
or we get famous.
there's a freaking human head in there!
don't worry, it's not real.
sure as hell looks real to me.
"what we in the business like to call a ""special effect""."
pretty cool, huh?
a little taste of what's waiting for you in there.
thanks to our award-winning special effects team.
follow me, my friends.
in the warm, swampy water, lazy crocodiles wait for the next meal.
the indian crocodiles have long, pointed faces.
these crocodiles are called...
boys.
i see you're working hard as usual.
are we ready?
totally ready.
totally and absolutely.
let's keep it that way.
yes, ma'am.
hey.
great job selling the fear out there, man.
yeah.
i can't believe any of those kids stuck around for the show.
you actually looked like you were terrified out there.
well, that's because i am.
i mean, first of all, just looking at that place totally creeps me out.
did you know about that?
about the dead homeless people?
sure.
why didn't you say anything?
that's kind of a lot of people for a coincidence.
i mean, do you really think it's safe in there?
safe enough to get the show insured.
any more questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like a baby.
let's do this.
okay.
we are filming.
all of you have chosen, of your own free will, to spend the night in this prison for the chance to win $20,000 each.
pretty straight forward, right?
okay, then let's get this party started.
you'll find everything you need in your base camp, which is located in the warden's office.
where's that?
well, it's kind of complicated.
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you took away all of our possessions, so how are we supposed to write it down?
go straight down the hall, hang a right, another right, then a left.
then straight on up the first flight of stairs, a left, a right, then one more left.
you want me to say it again?
yeah.
too bad.
when you get there, you'll find the key to release you from those shackles.
is there anyone else inside?
we'll just have to wait and see.
i thought coming out of the closet was scary.
have fun, inmates.
good luck.
where's she going?
welcome to the task.
can you please not do that?
i can't see a damn thing in here.
does anybody remember which way he said to go?
it's straight, a right, then a left.
no, it's straight, two rights then a left.
"too many ""straights""."
"no, it's, ""go straight down the hall,"
"""hang a right, another right, a left."
"""then straight on up the first flight of stairs,"
"""a left, a right, and one more left""."
what are you?
she's smart.
guys, we're gonna have a great show.
careful.
careful.
jesus.
what is this place?
okay, and get ready.
that was fun.
and speed them up.
yes, my queen.
come on!
now go!
left turn.
why am i not seeing anything?
shit, shit, shit, shit.
well, i don't know.
the power's going down, the backup should've kicked in by now.
shit!
hurry!
it's a weird glitch, huh?
careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
damn, it's cold in here.
look, key.
hell yeah.
okay.
hey, guys, look.
yeah, come on.
cool.
all right, you.
who's that?
i guess it's the warden.
get this one.
okay, yeah.
hey, check this out.
what you got, man?
"""greetings, brave contestants."
"""welcome to warden clem harvis' personal office."
"""in the center of the room is a box."
"""this chess piece will determine your own personal symbol."
"""you cannot trade with any of the other contestants."
"""razor blades were a personal favorite""."
"""now, it's your turn to put your hand in the box""."
shit.
so, who wants to go first?
me.
what the hell is going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i mean, i don't know.
seriously?
you should have seen all of your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black rook.
white knight.
white queen.
hey, look.
holy shit!
okay, that is really fucking creepy.
welcome, my little piggies, to the task.
now, for a little history of pennyville state prison.
in 1931, with the climbing budgets during the depression, the cold blooded warden thought he could keep his fortune on track by eliminating certain overhead costs.
his inmates!
eventually the warden was exposed, but not before having executed 85 inmates!
the last person to be served a death sentence here was warden harvis himself.
rumor has it that the warden still roams the halls.
tonight, you will be asked to go face to face with the warden, and the tortured souls that still inhabit the building you are now in.
task one.
white queen.
try not to die!
does anybody want to trade?
hell no!
okay.
"""the white queen will got to the prison chapel to complete his task."
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
still in the first hallway.
nice job with the sound.
hey, thanks.
oh, shit.
what?
they turned my torch off.
i can't see a damn thing.
okay, take it easy, randall.
now, make a right and go straight.
there's babies hanging!
children's...
i imagine they have the place wired for audio input.
audio being more profound in tapping into our primal fears than sight.
is that right?
okay.
god!
sounds like a real sweetie.
no, i'm good, man.
freaking stoner.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
it was a sound.
i think someone's in the room with me.
they're using speakers, randall.
seriously.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flash light.
okay, now what?
"""open the bible to the marked page..."
"""where you'll find the lord's prayer."
"""having been desecrated 75 years ago,"
"""this once holy place is a likely hotspot of paranormal activity""."
"oh, my. ""in reverse""."
no way.
oh, hell no, man.
don't do that shit.
i can't do that.
"""once your task is completed..."
"""if there is no sign of the warden,"
"""you can return to base camp""."
deep breath, randall.
just do it.
please forgive me, whoever i may be pissing off.
this wasn't my idea.
okay.
"""evil from us deliver"
"""our father who art in heaven..."
"""but temptation into not us lead."
"""and us against trespass..."
"""who those forgive we as trespasses our us forgive."
"""and bread daily our day this us give."
"""heaven in is it..."
"""as earth on done be will thy,"
"""heaven in art who father our""."
please say i can leave now.
"""before you head to the base camp""..."
god, randall, you have to blow out the candle.
you're joking, right?
and sit there for one minute.
the things i do for money.
where'd he go?
it would be my estimation that the production has cut off our ability... to communicate with our homosexual friend... in order to create a more terrifying atmosphere.
whatever.
sure, like clockwork.
guys?
i think we got some really good stuff.
guys?
guys?
guys!
do you see anyone?
no.
come on, dude, it couldn't have been that bad.
totally not worth the money.
but having done it, it was totally worth the money.
oh, thank god i'm finished.
look at me, i'm still shaking.
i don't think i could handle doing it again.
they might ask you to do another one.
don't joke.
i swear you can feel some kind of twisted vibe out there.
it's like walking through heavy fog, only it's ice cold.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
yeah, she's right.
i want to go next.
what exactly do you mean,
"""there are some cameras down""?"
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but this is pretty complicated stuff.
we'll get scelzi to go down... and have a look and fix them.
scelzi.
yeah.
yeah, i need you to go down and have a look at some cameras.
yeah.
boys.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
well, we talk now or i walk.
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
well, i've been doing a little research.
"and by ""research,"" what you actually mean... is you've been fucking one of the local girls."
am i right?
loose lips sink ships, taylor.
okay, this prison didn't just have a men's wing, all right?
it had a women's wing, too, all right?
and the twisted fucking warden would roam around it, naked, answering to no one.
he beat them, he raped them, made them have his children, then he starved them to death.
people say he even fed some of them their own babies.
what's your point?
my point?
my point is that the real story would have made the show a hit!
everybody would've been talking about us.
the story you cranked out is nothing compared to the real one.
i agree.
so why didn't we use it?
because the town said they'd sue us if we did.
right.
are we done here?
yeah.
oh, yeah?
what's that?
anyway, i'm gonna go take a nap.
they on?
yep, they're on.
sweet.
scelzi, what was that?
just a little something to get me through the night.
do you want?
just get your hairy butt back here, okay?
aye, aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the shit out of me.
i've got some good stuff.
suit yourself.
we are totally ready to go.
i would have to say my biggest fear would be being buried alive.
where do i go next?
"""this will lead you to freedom row""."
all right,
i'm at the end of freedom row.
what do i do next?
tell him to go right again.
go straight on and then right.
oh, shit!
what?
blood.
it's not real blood.
no shit, sherlock.
i love that girl.
oh, man, please tell me i get to go up and not down.
sorry.
eighty paces?
who do i look like, a pirate?
you should see a metal door... once you've gone a flight down.
it says...
damn.
"""welcome to solitary confinement, cell number five."
"""for the violent and frequently insane,"
shit.
look, just tell me what i need to do... so i can get the hell out of here.
no!
thanks.
you guys ever get tired of complimenting each other?
the things i do.
"it says, ""if an inmate failed in his suicide attempt,"
"""you are to now re-enact the torture of a prisoner""."
okay, so where is it?
under your feet.
i mean, this thing is, like, full of shit in here.
money, money, money.
that's a pretty harsh task.
"""once in the hole, you are to await further instructions""."
okay.
hello?
hello?
hey, no offense, but i really hope you're not my task.
connie.
what?
take a look at this.
what?
that isn't...
you're fired.
why?
you go behind my back and you hire some extra to be in the show... when i specifically told you not to, and you wanna know why you're fired?
that's not my guy.
where'd he go?
who the fuck was that?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you've got to get that guy out of there, all right?
i mean, this is gonna screw up the show.
damn.
this is gonna kill us.
you're sure this isn't just you screwing around?
scout's honor.
it's so obvious.
what is so obvious?
come closer.
remember when i asked you... why you were having snow rig cameras in the control booth?
yeah.
the network wanted some guys in there... to shoot some behind-the-scenes...
fuck me!
fuck me!
you're right.
it's kind of genius, isn't it?
it's total genius.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
you mean to tell me that the network is throwing some twists into the game just to see how freaked out we get?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
go on with the show.
as planned.
task three.
black king and white knight.
task four.
black rook and white queen.
told you you might have to do another task.
smartass.
okay, black king and white knight are to turn right and make their way to the gas chamber.
white queen and black rook are to go straight and head to the prison kitchen.
okay, laters.
good luck.
"""king and knight go left and then right."
"""rook and the queen go to the end of the hall"
"""and take the stairwell down""."
scelzi, pick up.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, pick up.
we're in.
"""welcome to the gathering room."
you should see a light switch at the rear wall.
"""black king and white knight are to enter the gas chamber""."
again, nice set, connie.
can't take credit for that, it's the real deal.
only thing the legal department could clear.
cool, right?
well, it's scary all right.
christ!
what's that smell?
it is a well documented fact... that execution chambers frequently have the smell of death in them.
of course the smell isn't actually death.
when a human knows his or her life is about to come to an end, it will tend to reach an anxiety level... that will cause it to emit highly noxious odors.
in this particular case, we're smelling a combination of human smells... and the smells of the gas used to kill said human.
now for the fun part, boys and girls.
black king gets to sit down in the gas chair.
black king?
that would be me.
and await further instructions.
"""there you'll find some meat and a pan."
"""this is to be cooked and eaten""."
oh, man!
"""inmates were always suspicious that meat supplied..."
"""was not cow, pig or lamb,"
"""but something else."
"""something sweet and nothing like anyone had ever tasted before""."
so, we're talking human flesh, right?
you in?
yes.
guess what you get to do now?
i give up.
you get to strap toni in.
i'm paraphrasing here, but toni should fully comprehend... the fear the victims felt when they were about to be gassed.
you're good at that.
let's just say, some of my girlfriends have been on the kinky side.
is that okay with you?
okay.
"""your task is to shut off the master valve"
"""before the gas terminates your teammate""."
you need to follow the pipes.
makes sense.
taking bets?
i will bet 100 on her throwing up.
done.
it's weird.
i can't do this.
i can't.
it's my worst nightmare.
come on, sweetie, that's the show.
"""no more college debt""."
look, remember what he said?
"""if the team wins, there'll be a substantial bonus""."
do it for the team, girlfriend.
you gonna hurl?
thank you.
okay, angel, i'm at the bottom of the stairs.
shit!
do you hear me?
he's back.
this really stinks.
let me out.
hey, come on.
hey, let me out, man.
my god!
who is that man standing there?
topless.
so manly.
let me out.
i don't know, con. this guy is actually starting to creep me out.
hey, stop playing.
let me out.
so, what's up?
i need to talk with you.
outside?
sure.
big news.
i think the company's playing us.
what?
who's there?
who are you?
show me the chamber.
shall we cover rook and queen?
where are they?
i don't know, but just give me one second.
there.
there's that guy again, see?
wow.
who the hell is that?
okay, how'd he get there so quick?
that's the guy from the painting, right?
yeah.
yeah, it... it looks like him.
cool.
no, not cool.
he either walks through walls, or there are more than one of them.
we all seen the prestige, right?
do you mind if we pass?
please?
guys?
guys?
fake blood pack, fake shiv.
nicely done.
in fact, maybe even oscar worthy.
no.
no, that's not right.
this is way, way off script.
it looked real to me.
connie, they are playing us.
trust me.
what?
look.
they copied the picture.
what?
casting.
costume.
easy.
hold on.
no.
no.
he's a real ghost.
can't get any more off than that.
he goes any further with him, he's gonna take him off my grid.
what?
look, it's a huge prison.
i mean, i couldn't put my cameras everywhere.
show me the hole.
show me the chamber.
taylor, somebody's gotta go in there and see if they're okay.
i can tell you, they don't look okay.
she's acting, acting, acting.
where is scelzi then?
i don't know.
probably off his face somewhere.
i'm gonna call the office.
yeah, you too.
good night.
they say they've got no idea what's going on here.
still feels wrong.
okay, i'll go and prove it to you.
no problemo.
anyone coming?
yeah, i'll go.
i'll grab a camera and get some cool footage.
thank you.
you must be nice to them.
easy peasy lemon squeezy!
"""easy peasy lemon squeezy""."
hey, you know what?
you're actually kind of photogenic.
yeah, so funny, pretty boy.
i want to do my task.
kill the air-con.
come on.
connie, what do you wanna do?
hold the game.
wow, this place is kind of spooky, right?
it gets a bit weird.
where'd he go?
i don't know.
i didn't see him.
he went right past here.
dead end.
what was that?
yeah, what was that?
shit.
taylor?
put angel on screen.
we need to get those kids out of there.
can you hear me?
listen up.
there's been a slight change of plans.
we're gonna need to stop the show.
what?
why?
i'm gonna be honest with you.
there is somebody in there with you.
who?
we're not sure.
but i need you to get yourself out of there as fast as possible, understood?
you're playing me?
you're trying to freak me out.
open the door.
i want to win and i want my money.
so open the door!
who opened the door?
sorry, you're not serious, are you?
idiot.
you're task is to memorize and locate the clearly marked cell seven.
lucky!
in this cell, warden harvis received a near fatal stab wound from an inmate.
you'll find a key in that cell, and this key can release both your inmate colleagues from the hole and the gas chamber.
cool.
is that all you got for me?
easiest money i've ever made.
what am i afraid of?
nothing.
angel!
stanton?
help!
great, now she's gone off my grid.
hello?
who's there?
hello?
angel?
angel.
put me down.
who are you?
angel?
angel!
what...
this isn't right.
put me down.
hold on.
it's you.
no!
angel, are you okay?
he killed my brother.
he's gonna kill me.
he killed my brother.
new jersey school of acting.
not bad for a straight guy, right?
connie, you there?
yeah, just about.
how in the hell did you organize all of this?
with great difficulty.
it's gonna make a great show.
i will deal with you later.
i'm gonna de-rig some of my shit first, okay?
you really are an asshole.
you said you wanted a great show, didn't you?
well, you got it.
yeah.
you go wrap toni, i'll get dixon and stanton.
okay, snow, that's a wrap.
hey, guys, you all go get cleaned up and change.
let's get ready for the wrap party and some champagne.
great acting work.
show's over.
toni?
good job, dixon.
okay, dixon.
that's a wrap, buddy.
you okay?
quit dicking around, snow.
hey, you got anything to say?
we have to get them out of there.
we have to get them out of there.
get that out of my face!
divert to new coordinates, 5-1-7-7-7-9-4.
roger that, atc.
i spy with my little eye something beginning with r.
if you can't get it, you do a forfeit.
rain?
london control, the package was supposed to be in cia custody 19 minutes ago.
our aircraft is waiting.
good job our guest's not in a hurry.
traffic tower says they'll be moving within eight minutes.
the home office cupboards are bare.
we're going to have to be a little bit more imaginative with our funding.
where the bloody hell is oliver?
where's the air cover feed?
you can overrule, but you'll need to issue an executive countermand.
something's got to be done.
director general.
i know you don't like hearing this from a politician, but reform is coming.
you do know that lift is for emergencies only?
escort two, what's your status?
you got ants in your pants, juney?
you know, you would be a lot less uptight if you'd just let yourself be my london girlfriend.
the position's not gonna be open much longer.
i spy with my little eye something beginning with...
bikes, travelling at speed.
put them up.
calum, nearest police units?
scramble everything we've got, now.
code one!
attack in progress!
oh, my good god.
june, for christ's sake, don't.
get out, now!
lethal force is authorised.
open the van or everyone dies.
open the van now!
pearce.
the americans will crucify us.
your operation, harry.
say again, control?
lay down your weapons and release qasim.
what the bloody hell are you doing, harry?
open the gates!
open the gates!
go, go, go!
control, prisoner escaped!
heading north!
no, no, no!
keaton!
control, lead two pursuing on foot.
any more feeds?
follow her.
nearest armed unit's eight minutes away.
helicopter's 20 miles out.
roadblocks?
in place.
other side of that tunnel and the last junction.
there's nowhere for them to go.
sco19 is seven minutes away.
go.
lead two, report.
ed, wait.
lead two, report.
i repeat, the cia liaison officer has been shot.
lead two, do you have eyes on qasim?
control, i hear a vehicle.
they've knocked everything out.
it's over.
the bbc can confirm that the american terrorist leader adem qasim has escaped from mi5 custody in one of the most serious failures in the organisation's history.
it's understood that the secure convoy transporting qasim came under armed attack en route to raf northolt.
you say it's not war but murder because it happens on western streets.
because you didn't ask for it in new york, in washington, in london.
but the children of pakistan, they didn't ask for it either.
when they're bombed by drones, they call it murder, too.
qasim presents a new kind of threat.
so far, he hasn't targeted civilians.
our models show a 90% chance of attack within 48 hours.
the more pressure he's put under, the smaller that window becomes.
i can't tell you while the tape's...
the secretary of state flies in tomorrow.
we serve the british people, not washington.
if that's no longer true, then we're already finished.
the americans feel we're no longer fit for purpose.
we need a scalp.
i'm to be decommissioned in the morning.
you heard nothing about qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, if you're out, what happens to me?
you get out, too.
no one else knows you're inside qasim's network.
just walk away.
will holloway?
go.
so, how is life after mi5?
you're not from the moscow section.
you're needed back in london.
anyone you need to say goodbye to?
thank you.
we know about harry's connection to your family, so we understand this may not be easy for you.
it'd be fine, even if he was dead.
harry's too bloody arrogant to kill himself.
he was certainly acting like someone who was about to.
he went to visit this woman's grave.
love of his life.
harry's team has noticed changes in his behaviour since her death.
he's become emotionally distant, cold, been drinking heavily.
the water would have been below nine degrees.
he'd have developed hypothermia before reaching the bank.
this is a picture before he walked into shot, and this is a picture after you say that he jumped.
before he disappeared, harry made three encrypted phone calls.
your ex-service emergency voicemail.
why call you?
i have no idea.
last time i spoke to him was the night he decommissioned me from mi5 three years ago.
well, he wants to chat now.
that makes you useful.
will you help us find him?
no, thanks.
you and harry ever talk much about berlin?
the night your father died?
if there's something else, mace, i have a right to know.
oh, i don't think it's up to me...
if you're not going to actually murder him, i think you've made your point.
find harry and you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
although i doubt i'll take that title to the grave.
until recently, head of counter-terrorism for her majesty's security service.
funny, but who are you really?
someone who knows what these two words mean to you.
asma shishani.
go.
how did you find me?
so what do you want?
i know it was someone on my side.
they never told me who they were.
of course they didn't, but you must have had a contact.
a phone number, that's all.
a phone number will do nicely.
and in return, i'll give you what you want.
there is no way you could get that.
she said she was a human rights lawyer.
helped two of my brothers after they were imprisoned by your government.
but after i was freed, she became too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if she's a spy, she's not one of ours.
just so i'm clear again, tell me she's nothing to you.
you keep her alive, she's your guarantee that i'll keep my word.
i don't need guarantees.
get her to a hospital now, or the deal's off!
what she needs is mercy.
no!
she has a daughter.
and still, you sent her after me?
you put her in danger and then you refuse to spare her the pain?
what sort of a man are you?
spare her family from the video.
harry...
you've got a deal.
the bbc understands there has been no breakthrough in the hunt for escaped terrorist adem qasim.
the national threat level has been raised to critical, indicating an attack is imminent.
in business news, the ftse 100 fell again this morning and sterling continued to slide against the dollar, the euro and other major trading currencies.
we have fresh intel on harry.
he bought a pay-as-you-go phone that we tracked to the kent coast.
holloway, this is classified.
we found traces of explosive there, too.
you've known him longer than any of us.
do you think it's at all possible qasim might have got to harry somehow?
turned him?
i don't know.
regardless, find harry, we find qasim.
anything for holloway?
there you are.
tomorrow, 12 pm.
park in short stay one, row a, bay one.
then, keep your eyes open.
i hope you'll come alone.
for protection only.
if you can't bring in one loopy cold war relic without shooting him, we really are in trouble.
no promises.
it says not to yet.
we play this harry's way until we've got eyes on him.
roger that.
doors opening.
go.
level zero.
doors opening.
open sightlines, multiple exits.
say again, holloway.
they're harry's requirements for running a meet.
yes, mr holloway, your uncle said he'd meet you at the coffee shop.
he left his mobile at home.
guy in the car park, get rid of him.
he might as well be wearing an mi5 t-shirt.
listen to me.
stop underestimating harry.
don't think he won't put your people in danger.
we wait for him to make his...
what is it, alpha one?
holloway?
holloway, where are you going?
wait.
no, we're not set up there.
stand down.
holloway, stand down!
terminal 5b.
doors closing.
he's booked me on a flight.
pa309 to glasgow.
i'm going to glasgow.
call the glasgow office.
get me the airport police ops command.
priority code sigma nine.
police request a clearer path to the terminal.
and get us cleared by heathrow security.
all remaining passengers for flight pa309 to glasgow...
holloway, do not go airside.
what am i doing here, harry?
i need to find someone outside the service that i can trust.
it's a short list when you take off the drunk, the mad and the dead.
it's quite telling, the fact that the closest thing i have to a friend is someone who thinks i ruined his life.
qasim's escape was sanctioned by someone at the very top of the service.
by one of the people who asked you to track me down.
that's why i had to disappear.
you had qasim.
he's our only connection to the traitor.
once he's in the system, he'll be silenced.
he's planning an attack.
someone wants to destroy the service itself.
you've lost it.
ruth's death...
don't!
look at it yourself, that's all i'm asking.
what do you expect, harry?
mi5 was all i had and you took it from me, for nothing.
hate me all you like, but i think you believe in the service.
what happened in berlin?
so that's how they got to you?
this may not pan out as you'd hoped.
i'm afraid i had to tip them off that there's something in the lining of your jacket.
nothing there of course, but they'll have to check.
i'm going to send you a number.
call me in 24 hours, please.
i am security services.
hands behind your back!
so you just let him walk away.
calm down, francis.
we wouldn't want you to have a stroke.
not a fatal one, anyway.
mi5 is looking like a complete liability right now and i'm just about the last friend left in government it has.
so you should really be nice to me.
in other words, he's lost the plot?
that wouldn't contradict his last three psych evaluations.
he refused to attend them.
well, he hasn't stopped being harry pearce.
even completely gaga, i'd still take him over...
well, this chap, for example.
asked me to help him disappear.
it didn't occur to you to agree and then turn him over to us?
just because your life hasn't been worth a damn since harry booted you, don't think we can't very easily make it even less satisfactory.
since we're all threatening each other, you three should be under no illusions that you're not teetering on the edge.
your whole organisation is looking pretty bloody disposable right now.
find qasim.
fully loaded.
they are ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i've seen that name in a case study.
i thought they decommissioned you.
they did.
now, what really happened?
the escape may have been set up by someone in the service.
do you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i only gave up six weeks ago.
there must be one here.
just tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't apply.
when i was 17, i went out with a guy who did money transfers.
k section were interested in some of the people using it, so they approached me.
so you started as an agent?
and when i was done, they asked me to train as an officer.
my family laughed when i told them that.
and if someone you worked for had helped qasim to escape, that would matter, right?
okay.
something did feel wrong that day.
rob vass, my team leader, he was in the lead car with me.
he told me not to open the weapons compartment.
he ordered me not to pursue.
where does he live?
loaded.
w78 account prefix.
panama city.
service slush fund.
june, what the hell are...
who are you?
you told me not to pursue qasim.
that's what you said to me when i went for my weapon.
we swore an oath, rob.
i'm not saying anything until we get to thames house.
we're not going to thames house.
will, what have you found?
qasim's escort was deliberately weakened.
the team leader was in on it.
he's just the errand boy.
find out who gave the order.
the americans think mi5 is a weak link and i think somebody here agrees with them.
qasim escapes, we're disgraced.
the cia quietly take over.
he was...
he was going to fire.
we could...
he's dead, he's dead.
he's dead.
listen.
you have to go home.
june!
i'll deal with this, but you have to go, now.
i've never heard a piece murdered with such glee.
who's warrender batting his eyelashes at?
landon miller.
agency hawk.
he's trying to secure their continued support, hopefully without handing over the keys to the kingdom.
every time i see you, francis, you seem to be buried another inch or two deeper in the recesses of some swivel-eyed wonk from langley or the pentagon.
you don't have to tell me.
i just think, in times like these, we all need to remember which flag flies over our heads.
francis.
i'm trying to help and he practically accuses me of moonlighting for the cia.
tonight, your generals, your politicians, your spies, met for a celebration.
tonight, we struck back at the heart of their power.
our enemies are the politicians who send your sons and your daughters to die in illegal wars.
the spies who spy on you, like you are the criminals.
this fight goes beyond religious differences.
all flights out of the uk...
you had him.
warrender would be alive.
if you have a way to get to qasim, give it up, right now.
there's another way.
qasim's wife.
asma shishani.
the fsb have her.
if i can work out where they're holding her, he'll give up the traitor.
you made a deal with him.
yes.
and if we see it through, it'll lead us to him.
come in now and we'll set it up.
how do you know the russians have his wife?
in exchange for a blown cia officer stuck in moscow.
i can remotely access it, but i need you to open the back door.
this is an ip address.
you are joking.
it's the only way, will.
harry's getting help from somewhere.
i've ruled out old contacts, but i need access to personnel files to do it properly.
still won't get you anywhere exciting.
in place.
seems like i'm going to have to steal a lot of extra bandwidth.
the borough's.
malcolm?
okay, i'm in.
trawling the servers now.
harry, we need to get moving.
can we do this any quicker?
i could, yes.
unfortunately, this machine is pre-millennial.
g branch already pulled these.
erin watts.
might be worth a closer look.
fill in the blacked-out bits for me.
but i had an agent left exposed.
i almost got him out.
i'd been in that job less than a year.
sooner or later they make you choose.
well, i'll let you get on.
are we nearly there?
sure about what?
i'm sorry, will.
harry.
harry!
harry, what did you do?
stand away from the computer.
i've never had to say this to you before, but i hope you know what you're doing.
is harry working with qasim?
he stole an entire gchq data archive.
everything we have on friendly western agents in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
he popped up on schönefeld airport's cctv.
i don't know.
harry didn't run that cyber attack himself.
so who's helping him?
besides you.
and still you're protecting him.
why?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i can find him.
and chatter's spiking.
analysis indicates a large-scale attack in the next 48 hours, suggesting multiple targets.
an officer present at qasim's escape is missing.
signs of a struggle in his home.
know anything about that?
how's your mother, holloway?
doesn't keep too well, i hear.
never has, since your father died.
understandable, really.
and then comes that knock at the door.
i know, i know.
harry was right about one thing.
you're not good enough.
home secretary, can we really hope to stop qasim striking again?
we have faced down threats to our freedom and way of life time and again.
your ability to wound us may be significant, but it is finite.
you will find our resolve to be without limit.
they're not listening.
have they never killed our women?
we're making a better world, brother.
transfer team in position at city airport.
we have atc authorisation to hold the runway for prisoner transport when necessary.
i think i owe you one.
you kept quiet about vass.
danke.
alexanderplatz.
northeast corner by the subway, 11:00 am.
we have a safe house.
call it nostalgia.
don't forget to bring the archive.
don't forget to bring his wife.
how did you find me?
there's only one place to run a meet in berlin.
you used to tell me.
northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
undone by sentimentality.
that's the price of qasim's wife.
once she's out of fsb custody, he gives me a phone number.
that gets me to the traitor.
they'll destabilise the service to the point where it's justifiable to take it over.
get in the car, harry.
there's an old hotel 10 minutes away.
my contact can meet us there with clean passports for all three of us.
you're going home.
sorry about this.
why are you here, miss keaton?
keep moving, harry.
i killed someone because of you.
you're c2, aren't you?
what are you doing, harry?
talent spotting.
and which one of you found it?
for god's sake, will.
preparation is everything.
what about vass?
when you came to my house, i called it in.
said someone was asking about qasim's escape.
i was put through to command and they told me what to do.
they got to vass's apartment ahead of us and planted the evidence.
i tricked vass into running.
you think i wanted to do it?
i know my duty.
i'm the only one here who does.
you were played.
she's right, will.
but i wonder if miss keaton is so sure about me.
it was a secure command line.
what was i supposed to do?
do you believe her?
yeah.
i'm sure your people will come and find you, if you haven't outlived your usefulness.
after all this was over, what did you think they were gonna do with you?
all i've done is what they asked of me.
we're changing the deal.
we take qasim's wife back to london.
tell him he comes to the handover in person or he never sees her again.
let's go get her.
what happened to alexanderplatz?
sudden attack of agoraphobia.
i'm afraid there was a problem with qasim's wife.
at least be good enough to put her in my car.
harry.
colonel.
i hate to be ungentlemanly, but we're going to need your clothes.
as the manhunt for adem qasim intensifies, all passengers travelling on the uk's national rail network will have to show valid id and face on-board bag checks.
i have your wife.
so let me speak to her, then.
the russians have sedated her and...
bullshit.
i'm bringing her to london.
no.
i'll tell your whore you said goodbye.
was the baby thing too much?
no, it was very you.
i trusted june.
you were right to decommission me.
despite everything i've done, you're still here trying to do some good.
i won't let their sacrifice be in vain.
it was down there.
was it quick?
he could have given me up, but he chose not to.
you try anything, anything at all, i can't guarantee anyone's safety.
anyone's.
you bring my wife, i give you your phone number.
we're on.
hello?
holloway.
that message came from h branch.
i do.
we can get to qasim, but we need help.
call it in and we disappear.
one clean choice, hannah.
trust me and help me.
or walk away.
do good or do well, eh?
shit.
they're nearing position.
the self-perpetuating algorithm i wrote last night is constantly updating, revising all potential vantage points.
sudoku not cutting it, then?
please.
okay, we're here.
how long do we have?
i'm covering over 300 cameras.
give me something.
as soon as he realises we're playing him, he's gone.
wait.
it was working 30 seconds ago.
are you sure?
yes, confirmed.
camera's gone down in the last minute.
third level roof, east corner.
harry, we need to stall.
we have to assume he's looking directly at us.
yes?
you were told to be facing south.
i have his wife.
you were meant to face south.
give me the number.
give me the number now or we walk.
turn around now or i put you down.
there.
her, too.
i haven't gotten him yet.
you've got five seconds to turn around.
turn.
well, maybe this guy's never seen her.
i'm almost there.
is it her?
kill her.
give me the number.
don't!
stop!
no!
okay?
will, she's all right.
sniper's dead.
then it's over.
malcolm, make yourself scarce.
yes?
my wife's dead, isn't she?
harry, listen.
let hannah call us in.
harry?
hannah, why is harry off comms?
no idea.
call us in.
get sco19 here now.
four vans loaded with rdx leaving from limehouse north industrial park within the next 15 minutes.
how do you know that?
qasim just told me.
vans loaded with bombs leaving in 15 minutes.
i think we got him.
let's get going!
armed police!
stay where you are!
clear!
clear!
eyes on principal.
negative!
negative!
negative, sir.
command, we are clear.
harry.
he gave up his own men.
why would he do that?
what have you done?
armed police!
don't move!
go!
you need to tell them everything, harry.
i'd say we're due a catch-up.
might be a little over this one's head, though.
ever since the southwest corner of alexanderplatz.
keep holloway close by.
make sure he's secure.
perhaps we won't be so hasty.
have you found qasim?
harry will talk.
you still don't know him.
qasim gave up his entire operation.
what did you say to him?
i'd have thought they'd cut you loose after berlin.
they want to offer you a deal.
pin everything on harry and walk away.
i told them i'd do this, then i'm out.
"there is no ""out""."
i can't.
you have an emergency backup key on a chain around your neck.
whatever you're up to...
what would ruth think of it?
what did you give him?
check the back.
southwest corner.
i found harry on the northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
the opposite.
where you trap someone.
harry?
i gave him you.
stay down!
stay down!
stay down!
lock us down.
stay down!
stay down!
we're not here for you!
we're here for them.
you stay down!
think about your families.
hamza.
why?
there's 50 armed men the other side of those doors.
you should give yourselves up.
get here.
open it!
if you think we're going to negotiate...
open the door.
but he'll kill us.
there's so much evil in one room.
your only chance of getting out of here alive is to surrender...
do you think i want to get out?
how many people's lives began to end in this room?
my people's lives.
your people?
nobody asked you to speak for them, to kill for them.
if you want a hostage...
i think he's made it clear he's not interested in hostages.
i'm the director general of mi5.
kill me and then put down your gun.
otherwise you're just one more dead terrorist.
no one's going to see you as a hero.
by the time we've finished, you'll be a drunken, wife-beating, impotent kafir.
we'll wheel out a couple of marrakech rent boys, give them free tickets to disneyland in return for saying you begged them to piss on you.
can't have you being remembered well, can we, adem?
wait, wait, stop.
called off the helicopter.
but i...
you bloody coward.
i thought you fought to a higher standard.
i'm sorry, adem, about the loss of your wife.
i know what that can do to you.
is that supposed to stop me?
it's okay.
stop!
why did you bring him here?
i made a choice.
with no backup plan.
why do you think i kept you out of that room?
people are still dead, harry.
far fewer than would have died in the bombings.
how do you make a choice like that?
it's my job.
auntie g, can you come outside to play?
hello, geraldine.
in the end, it comes down to who can tell the best lie longest.
don't you think?
if we'd had cover that morning, qasim would never have got away.
you sent a secret directive to the met's air unit ordering them to decline all mi5 requests, didn't you?
that's the advantage of being a lone maniac.
i don't need to make it stick.
sacrificing your own service so it could be absorbed by a foreign power.
the americans would have made you director general, no doubt.
how many more lives was that promotion worth?
what was it you think you accomplished, harry?
the service is dying.
but if i'd given up the fight the moment i realised i was on the losing side, my career would have been a short one.
blow my brains out for my 10-year-old niece to find?
this came from you, i take it.
what is it?
perforates the small bowel over six hours or so, causing irreversible haemorrhaging.
leaves no trace.
how clever.
i was afraid that would be your answer.
that's why i've taken the decision out of your hands.
it's not your pub lunch that's making you queasy.
i had the rib of beef, too.
tell me you're lying, harry.
please.
tell me you didn't betray your country.
it's been four hours already, geraldine.
you can spend the last two in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd go and play with that beautiful niece of yours.
thinking about it.
your message said you had something to tell me.
they've put surveillance on ruth's grave.
you can't go there any more.
i have something which, by rights, should be yours.
your father was wearing it the night he died.
the stasi stripped his body of everything that could be useful and it found its way into an fsb archive somewhere.
he was wearing a wedding ring on the night of his op?
i didn't decommission you because you weren't good enough.
after your father, i couldn't...
i had to protect you.
the good ones tend not to last, will.
then who does?
the ones like me.
if you know your trouble, it would be helpful if you could tell the men at the door.
there's enough for every guest at hotel elementary school.
form up, single file.
this new trouble kills in complete darkness.
these people will be thanking you when night falls.
i guess we need to keep 'em here to keep 'em safe, but i just worry that it's only gonna go from bad to worse.
they have no idea who's causing the darkness trouble.
besides, it's not what hides in the dark we need to worry about.
still haven't figured out how to bring down that fog wall yet.
maybe that's a blessing.
that was the latest from in-flight safety.
listen, i'm in your neck of the woods, and... as it turns out, i may need a new job.
it's under control, but i'd love another pillow for my beauty sleep.
try to fix the troubles.
we've already talked about this.
it's almost impossible to remove a trouble without killing someone.
sure, i just need tools i don't have, materials that are impossible to get, and knowledge that might not exist.
gonna need a team.
any idea what's going on?
however, there's a bad element.
this is the only way to keep the rest of us safe.
and with the magnet trouble active, cars are risky too.
an engineer to help repair the power plant.
he volunteered as soon as he found out.
you can use her trouble to power the plant in case things go sideways.
what in the sam hill are you thinking?
the no marks killer's out there.
and i think, really, she just wanted to prove to you she genuinely wants to help.
okay, well, whatever the reason, just keep an eye on her for me, okay?
'cause she and i, we're not immune to these new troubles.
well, it's not just about her being my mom.
while you're gone, i'll just keep searching the school for the person with the darkness trouble.
he stole those batteries and endangered us all.
there was no other choice, dwight.
then that's three in two weeks.
and now the serial killer is in this building.
all right, well, i will go ahead and talk to dwight.
my dad always said you were a good guy.
mara's father.
there might be, but if you ask me to explain it, it'll just seem all the more daunting, so please don't.
"moreover, i can't even find a ""haven, maine,"" on a map."
you're telling me you can't find a town with 25,000 people?
this wasn't caused by troubles.
then why didn't we use aether to end the troubles from the start?
not with the thinnies sealed.
then how are we going to?
well, gloria brought over a box of stuff that duke left at the gull.
i can't believe that william had the amount i need, and... aether's just step one.
you told his wife that you would find him.
it's easy making choices from the sidelines, but sometimes, things aren't what they seem.
i got a town to protect.
no wonder the plant's working at 50%.
guys, i'll try, but remember, i've never done anything like this before.
i can't even pay for the oil change that they made me get to park here and talk to you.
if all goes well, i'll be back with some aether by sunset.
that's peggy's husband, rolf.
there's enough panic and fear as is.
the same person murdered my son 27 years ago?
"we're calling his murderer ""the no marks killer."""
what else are you keeping from me, vince?
dwight is doing his best to keep order to enforce the rules, but he doesn't have it in him to kill.
in this haven, banishment equals execution.
thanks to our friend there, we're keeping them in a... prison of sorts.
it says the generator's only operating at 40%.
damn it, the generator must have dumped its energy reserves when it overloaded.
well, that explains why the power's coming on in town one block at a time.
well, at this rate, five minutes or so.
so i'm kind of running out of these, and they're the only thing that are keeping the darkness from killing us.
there, i reconfigured the generator settings to get power to the town faster, but... that's the best i can do.
they better get back soon.
so help each other.
crowd around the lamps.
share supplies.
i'll put it this way, i'm happier here.
i, uh, got your call.
get in the damn car now.
now, come on, get in!
if war lies ahead, then we'll all be thankful for it... even slean.
i can't think of anything worse than being in love.
i don't like this place.
there are two sides to every story.
whoever's behind this is a man and a traitor.
let's go.
he asked i stand for him at slean's union with keela.
saray, you are my brother's love.
and so you are my sister.
you must have seen places much grander than this in the farlands.
none ruled by a woman.
you must each choose a second to be your companion and look after your interests during the rituals.
and you'll attend your binding of friends and kin.
i have no kin here.
my mother and others will join you.
keela, this is saray from bregan.
rheda, must i be guarded all the time?
i don't really understand such things.
but i do know that i must marry slean.
and i know i will come to love him.
this wedding cannot take place.
abrecan is counting on you.
what's your trade?
carpenters.
then they can use you on the wall.
who are you?
a friend of the reeve.
like i said, i've things to attend to.
have to re-think how we handle it.
varr said i can't accept gifts.
it'll be our secret, then.
all brides should smell sweet for their wedding.
but remember... it's our secret.
sit down.
we'll take what we came for while they're nursing sore heads.
you wanted to talk?
all right.
keela, it's time for your rituals.
elvina, will you be my second?
for the game.
we need to meet.
discuss any reasons the marriage shouldn't go ahead.
if we don't fulfil our duties, their union could be void.
beowulf!
let's celebrate.
in the old way!
oh, the cloth absorbs the smell.
i'm so sorry.
it was a mistake.
that's all.
we help slean retrieve the token to give to his bride.
sounds easy enough.
breca!
open the gate!
come on, you stinking mudborn.
come on!
come on!
gimme your arm.
come on!
slean.
quiet, keela's sleeping.
so are they ready for this marriage?
i see no season why slean shouldn't marry keela, do you?
no, i don't think it is.
he must put his own feelings aside and do what is best for all.
would you put aside what you want for the sake of others?
it's what we all must do.
if a man or a woman spends their whole life pleasing others, then they're not living at all.
it must be very liberating to think like that.
try it.
tell a truth at each stone.
only then can you look upon one another and light the fire signifying your union.
you will then be man and wife.
have you ever loved anyone?
no.
i thought before i came here that you would be...
do you want to be thane?
tell my uncle i am done with him.
go.
go!
get out!
you let her go.
we aren't done here.
don't you understand?
i've betrayed my mother, i've plotted with my uncle.
that woman was sent here to kill you!
i don't know.
don't i?
i killed my sister.
she is the one who should have been with you today.
even as the world turned to dust, mara had everything.
people loved he because she was kind.
my father loved her because she was first.
and she had rowan.
and then... the chance to escape.
to need for nothing.
she died of a fever.
she was recovering.
i poisoned her.
slean, i will never breathe a word of what you have done, of what happened here today.
or stay.
i know, but she is beowulf's.
he came to her bed last night.
but we can choose who we make our way through this world with.
light the fire with me.
you wish to be thane?
i can help you.
against whoever stands in your way.
they can't take it away from you now, rheda.
with this marriage, you are jarl of the shieldlands.
these laws of the jarl are to be obeyed by all tribes.
the life of a murderer will be forfeit, unless blood money is paid.
a common thief will be branded and cast out.
fixed prices on all goods traded in the shieldlands will be set by the jarl.
what right does she have to set the price of fish?
it is us who risk our lives each summer to catch the pandiri.
you should have told me about these laws.
you were where your people needed you the most... at the watch.
i could not disrupt you.
you were distracted enough.
the pandiri are late.
some think you missed them again.
but if you fail, bregan will have another poor, hungry winter.
breca's wanted for murder, you know it.
kill him!
kill breca now!
i'll do it!
do that here without any explanation and we're all dead.
he hired us to bring breca to law after he escaped the noose.
ask the man who helped him escape the first time?
so we'll overlook that.
but we must have breca.
herot could be moving against our gates as we speak!
when did we become the killer of young women?
what do you mean by that?
you have hid in the shadows for too long, abrecan.
remember who you are speaking to.
speak your piece.
the boy demands breca's life or blood money for the killing of his brother.
i didn't mean to kill anyone.
hurry up!
thank you.
breca swept my ma off her feet.
that's what he does... seeks out widows he thinks have coin and then he steals it and runs, this dirt-licker.
abandoned my mother and took off with everything of value she had.
so my brother pursued him.
and it cost him his life.
breca, is it true?
i'll pay the blood money for the boy's brother.
lila, do you even have 50 silver coins?
i don't want coin, i want blood!
silence!
the blood money is paid, breca will go free.
you lied to me.
pandiri.
pandiri!
tie it off quickly.
stand by, they're coming.
i saw them.
get out!
the council have been called.
harken wants to replace me because i've missed the pandiri!
you've failed me, slean's married keela, rheda is jarl!
you don't understand.
tell the council our enemies are gathering, that your sister cannot rule, that you want to save the shieldlands.
tell them that's why you've been distracted.
say it.
i'm sorry.
i knew breca had killed a man, but he spun me a different story.
it's nobody's fault but his.
lila, no one would think any less of you...
it's all i've got.
you have it?
this isn't 50 coins.
there's not enough.
and i'll hold him while he does.
there was enough coin?
lila?
leave this, beowulf, please.
you won't speak to lila.
you get on your horse, you leave herot, and you never come back.
you have no place here.
if herot's attacked, i wanna fight properly.
if herot's attacked, i'll protect you.
let's.
this isn't about mudborn.
i don't want to talk about him.
what i want to know is why you have to lie about training me.
well, it's wasted on you.
you don't even wanna be one.
is that so?
i didn't know we were training blacksmiths!
go.
now!
fighting girls now, is he?
and that looked more like the blacksmith was training the huskarla, from what i could see.
i know you think i have failed you.
that i have been distracted from my duties in bregan.
but there are reasons.
you speak treason against your own blood.
this land needs a warrior at its heart!
to bring its people out of the darkness.
a man of strength who will take control!
you talk of treachery against your sister to cover the simple fact you've failed to provide for your people.
what is the point of having fish if we are all to be slaughtered?
i stand here to place a vote of no confidence in our thane.
those who oppose abrecan as thane.
it is decided.
a new thane will be appointed and announced in the morning.
