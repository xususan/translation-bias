<unk> one day, you're gonna find the right woman to carry out this
but until then, i'll be right across the hall.

this <unk> was waiting for <unk> to come
that's the girl that <unk> told you about.

and here's your <unk> 
i have a <unk>

i also lost two pounds on your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
i came to learn
this is a good place to start. 
and michael, after i broke up with two girls in the <unk> i met
hey, <unk> is this one of my <unk> or is this <unk> room <unk> with our <unk> 
i think she's perfect for you. 
i used to think that would stop her from

in the <unk> of <unk> there is no <unk> in the <unk> of life
and michael began to question his son's moral <unk>

you know, very <unk> 
i mean, after mr. <unk> had a stroke. 
i thought you were

when billy the kid came to <unk> he needed a

over the next few months, the young <unk> became the most trusted man in

while billy the kid is now a part of the <unk> <unk> industry that's <unk> america's <unk> several hundred miles to <unk> one man is doing his best. 
calm down, gentlemen. 
i used my left hand as a <unk>
i wouldn't be here today if you hadn't thought of
we have to get to the <unk>
when they put us on the <unk> <unk> they took people's
you can trust
he's talking to
the lord is
this is known as <unk> <unk> 
but i think they wanted us to be <unk> 
it was a promise used in the
kill <unk> and kill people. 
if you destroy <unk> <unk> you'll find someone better. 
we thought we were

<unk> <unk> by the <unk> 
on september 4, <unk> crazy horse, a man who fought his entire life to protect his people and won battle after battle against the
crazy <unk> death is hard to talk about because it's hard to even think about it after
one of the things that's most fascinating about crazy horse and his <unk> is simply the fact that of all the many native <unk> across american history,
<unk> to the united states of america, as <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
i think that's the reason why he's so strong. 
with crazy <unk> gone, the <unk> people are looking for the <unk> the rest of

this is for you.
what about <unk> 
i don't care how

this has nothing to do with you.
it would be <unk> to
this competition has always been the <unk> between <unk> and <unk>
but like so many <unk> in <unk> it became personal. 
personal to the moment someone was killed. 
that's john henry <unk> 
he was killed because of

john <unk> death was on his way to find his <unk>
this road leads to <unk> a <unk> <unk> 
as the country continues to <unk> men like billy the kid are <unk>

you already did that, <unk>
it's possible for humans too.

this is how you
i have no choice but to <unk>
his name is <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is very <unk>
that's what i'm gonna do
<unk> <unk> 
as you can see, even if the <unk> is the same <unk> they're different
even when you take a person's <unk> you have to

it means getting into their

this technology could save lives.
is there a risk of <unk> <unk>
of course i
<unk> knows your wife's <unk> and <unk> 
the <unk> that they had
this <unk> will give them a chance to raise the family
we have to be open to a <unk> that will allow
<unk> you don't know who owns her <unk> do you? 
mr. <unk> was also known for his <unk> in life without <unk> <unk> 
i'm saying this because mr. paul, may have been the wrong thing to say
but there's no reason to believe that. 
i'm not sure when i'll be able
now it's your turn.
it may not be a
but i have a moral <unk> 
that's what it's about. 
then why are you standing
he lost his mother
<unk> 
one day <unk> <unk> <unk> big <unk> of <unk> 
they were trying to sell

when the technology starts to take over <unk> when it starts to take over
a <unk> heart <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
now it's <unk> and the public <unk> 
i have reason to believe that there are <unk> to destroy the
this could be happening.

listen, i'm sorry, this is a <unk> 
we can't expect our people to pay for every

and close your eyes, <unk> <unk> 
a minute before <unk> <unk> a game, he got up and played like he was
<unk> 
it's not illegal even to read the cards.

mr. <unk> i suggest you answer another question. 
you were found with your wife's body. 
there's no sign of forced <unk> 
i saw the man who did this
<unk> was trained to <unk> <unk> on a chemical <unk> 
these <unk> are worth hundreds of <unk> 
michael, this is daniel <unk>
we have a <unk> problem.
the world's third largest energy <unk> <unk> 
have you told anyone about us? 
the <unk> <unk> of coal <unk> has been <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> across the country
the <unk> tried to sue a mass <unk> 
so you've <unk> over <unk> <unk> in the last three years? 
why didn't you take
i was wondering the same thing, but i don't know how <unk> could have known that
what did you guys find out about

we're all <unk> 
it might help me.
the criminal court has no <unk> 
we must have thrown him out before he had

isn't it your job to figure that out, <unk>
let's see if we can find anything that <unk> <unk>
mr. <unk> isn't here to be <unk> 
i always will. 
that's a very important <unk> mr. <unk> 
you find the ring and you find my
mr. <unk> i believe you.
because the man who killed <unk> is still out there, and you have absolutely no <unk> about it. 
you can't use them against

daniel <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
do you have reason to believe that <unk> <unk> was involved in the murder
it seems to me a lot of <unk> have died
17 years ago, he used daniel <unk> as an expert <unk> and he <unk> a case. 
then why did <unk> <unk> report <unk> to 100 <unk> 
daniel <unk> was a brilliant man, but when he came to <unk> with
no, for you, this is just another <unk> that needs to be <unk> 
as soon as i tell you about the <unk> <unk> you toss me aside.

and i'm sure he will, too, <unk> 
<unk> them <unk> into <unk> 
well, that'll do.

why did i do that?
<unk> 
i'm not saying
what made you change your mind? 
well, everything's gonna be <unk> right? 
yeah. 
yeah. 
you're wasting your time.
i brought you the best <unk> 
this is the best heroin that money can
that's <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
here. 
<unk> the <unk> 
well, listen. 
wait. 
wayne young married within 48 hours, 
all for <unk> 
actually, <unk> 
all i have to
like i said, <unk> a <unk> 
but, for the most part, there's no life in the
the <unk> around here are <unk> of rare and <unk> <unk> that are
200 tons of <unk> 30 <unk> and it's the biggest <unk> that ever lived. 
despite their <unk> <unk> all the blue <unk> are the most <unk> and <unk> of all the
they can travel over <unk> miles a day. 
it takes a lot of effort to <unk> an enormous mouth, so only a <unk> <unk> when you see one. 
here, <unk> <unk> is usually very <unk> 
when it's all over the <unk> <unk> will
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> must be very <unk> because they have heavy <unk> that <unk> other sea <unk> 
small <unk> <unk> of <unk> only living among dead <unk> 
thanks to the extra <unk> of the <unk> the flying machine has <unk>
a good <unk> hundreds of <unk> 
all open ocean <unk> are designed to search for food.
so in the <unk> 
this <unk> fish must sleep in the <unk> of the <unk> 
in this world without <unk> these <unk> will be most <unk> with <unk> <unk> 
first opportunity in weeks. 
he can only strike when he is within a few
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
the open <unk> are so <unk> that some <unk> can only find enough <unk> as a team.
<unk> live in highly <unk> social <unk> 
working together they can build a wide <unk> of
small <unk> sometimes come together, <unk> <unk> 
they use <unk> <unk> to find their <unk> 
but these tiny <unk> spend most of their time in the <unk> where they
only when they come up to the surface. 
when a great deal of <unk> <unk> <unk> another <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> to prevent the <unk> from <unk> 
down here, food is much <unk> than <unk> so <unk> must do whatever it takes to protect precious <unk> 
<unk> only <unk> <unk> <unk> full of deadly <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> the top <unk> <unk> 
<unk> has special <unk> <unk> <unk> to capture <unk> 
this deep water <unk> is a long, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
the open sea may be a wide blue <unk> but like all <unk> it has
the sea <unk> <unk> deep ocean <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the surface. 
success here depends on sensitive <unk> 
<unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
the lion <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> so it's hard to <unk> how close he is to <unk> 
and the <unk> that <unk> and <unk> <unk> used to hide their <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
the <unk> <unk> that <unk> so many <unk> also <unk> these <unk> 
they travel hundreds of miles between sea <unk> using them as a point of <unk> <unk> 
both these <unk> are traveling between the <unk> and the other sea <unk> in the <unk> 
no one knows for sure why there are so many <unk> but those <unk> are definitely coming to look for food. 
if these little <unk> stay close to the <unk> the <unk> won't be
as long as the silver <unk> stay close to the ocean <unk>
there's never an easy meal in the open ocean.
here, the <unk> water exposed to the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> to the surface. 
black <unk> <unk> are the same size as <unk> but three times as <unk> and so they need a completely different flight <unk> 
<unk> have the longest <unk> of any bird and that <unk> them to <unk> the <unk> of the south polar <unk> 
first of all, you try to resist the <unk> of her <unk>
then we turn around and <unk> around in <unk>
many times, during the hunting <unk> there were no time left on the
because the <unk> are so strong here the <unk> <unk> are able to <unk> the <unk>
they don't appear to be a duck by <unk> so they rely on the <unk> of the south polar bear <unk> until
like all <unk> <unk> have to <unk> on land, but few <unk> in south <unk> are so <unk> so that they're <unk> 
about a half a million <unk> of <unk> come here every year. 
<unk> every few days to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> time to <unk> 
<unk> is so <unk> that only the <unk> are strong enough. 
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by the ocean <unk> but under the <unk> there's a powerful <unk> <unk> that are always
this <unk> is worth more than any other <unk> that have ever <unk>
all the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> will lead to this <unk>
<unk> tiny <unk> and animals brought together to <unk> the fresh <unk> of <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> continue to <unk> the <unk> of a few <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> that carry these <unk> are being <unk> by the <unk> of the ocean
<unk> <unk> <unk> times the longest <unk> in history. 
this is the <unk> <unk> of the ocean where <unk> <unk> together from the
each <unk> has an extraordinary sense of <unk> <unk> left by <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
when the attack <unk> move like a single body. 
each fish <unk> <unk> to the <unk> and the whole <unk> moves in <unk> 
even when more sea <unk> come into the <unk> it looks like the <unk>
the sea <unk> are supposed to make the <unk> look smaller and smaller than the
but with so few <unk> the <unk> is still <unk> 
all the sea <unk> can do is keep the <unk> at the <unk> and wait
<unk> <unk> <unk> so that the <unk> <unk> their way out of
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> in less than an hour. 
<unk> once again you have disappeared into your own <unk> 
this blue <unk> is still <unk> food to <unk> 
being so large it must find an average of four tons of food a
and because of the <unk> the sea is a <unk>
this blue <unk> has finally found what he's been looking for
a <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> hundreds of <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is <unk> its <unk> 
it takes so much effort to <unk> a fully <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk>
he used the <unk> of <unk> hair to throw the water out of his mouth. 
but it takes time to <unk> so much water. 
blue <unk> may not be as <unk> as other <unk> but they don't need to
no other hunter is better off <unk> his <unk> than the <unk> <unk> <unk> 
blue <unk> the world's greatest <unk> 
the <unk> <unk> has created a lot of <unk> 
when he found out, he became a <unk> mission.
<unk> worked with john <unk> the world's most important blue <unk> expert in the
john <unk> vital information from these <unk> <unk> 
well, part of this research and part of the reason that, uh, we're working with <unk> is that it gives us a unique chance to make scientific information we wouldn't be
so we are doing this under our research to get an <unk> into what they're doing <unk> how they're <unk> how they're <unk> how
the <unk> of the team depends on good water <unk> 
too <unk> and the <unk> literally <unk> into the <unk> 
<unk> 
the first year was <unk> by <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
the second year is better than the sea
blue <unk> only <unk> to the surface every 15 minutes before they <unk> into the
he's got to try and get the boat ahead of the <unk>
then <unk> <unk> into the water and hope to get close enough to <unk> the
this year the water is <unk> <unk> but it still takes time to <unk> the <unk> 
after weeks of <unk> all the <unk> finally come together and giving <unk> the chance of a
<unk> <unk> took a long time. 
i mean, he really <unk> like a <unk> train. 
the images of the blue <unk> <unk> are so rare that a <unk> <unk> on the surface of the <unk> are
this series is all about <unk> and so nice though it is to have that shot to make a <unk> we've got to get shots
and we have to wait for the <unk> to
that's maybe twice a month. 
<unk> sounds <unk> but very <unk> 
<unk> look at these <unk>
let's go take a look.
look at those <unk>
i still don't quite understand what you just said. 
david <unk> turned it down. 
she took a <unk> she walked up and took a huge <unk> 
they call them blue <unk> because of their <unk> <unk> under the water and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
i am going to try and get another <unk> up there, and the <unk> open <unk> one last time. 
it was probably less than ten minutes, but when i came out of the <unk> it was the <unk> thing i
to share the water and to look eye to eye with a blue <unk> is something i
and full <unk> 
yeah, that's a unique perspective. 
with this close <unk> the team have <unk> blue <unk> as never before and at last have started to reveal the secret life of the <unk> greatest
i don't like
no, i don't.
every friend in <unk> <unk> likes her. 
<unk> right? 
when <unk> went on a <unk> <unk> he <unk> a list of <unk> and <unk> and it helped <unk> the <unk> 
yeah, <unk> <unk> 
<unk> plus <unk> full of <unk> <unk> 
look, i'm coming to stay for a while.
no, you'll get in trouble.
<unk> <unk> 
okay. 
double <unk> <unk> 
and <unk> <unk> 
everyone thinks <unk> a dangerous place. 
<unk> 
i know every rabbit <unk> broken <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
and nice <unk> 
it doesn't matter where i am, <unk>
your wife has been
and <unk> 
all <unk> 
<unk> join us. 
but <unk> is a completely different person. 
if you think you can change your mind, think
i didn't really realize that you were a <unk>
wherever they go, there's a new trap. 
<unk> <unk> like christmas. 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> everything, <unk> 
could it be <unk> 
well, according to the
at least i'm not the first minus you
i suppose i should be grateful. 
i'm really sorry, <unk> 
i didn't mean to get you involved in all
believe me, i'm glad you feel that way. 
here's a nice <unk> 
my brother will break your heart, and when he does, i will not be there to
i promise i'll stay away from him.
you think <unk> third <unk> too? 
<unk> <unk> 
forgive me. 
yes, one question for you.
who can tell me the real meaning of <unk> de <unk>
<unk> de <unk> 
<unk> means dancing. 
but speaking <unk> what does that mean, <unk> <unk> 
<unk> de <unk> 
two <unk> one <unk> 
a man and a woman dancing together in the same <unk> 
this is what <unk> <unk>
i never danced with a man before. 
that's right. 
<unk> girls danced with girls. 
no boys. 
<unk> boys are just cute creatures that break their fingers
<unk> has three important <unk> 
trust. 
throw it at
<unk> 
great. 
and, most important of all, <unk> 
without them, yes... 
<unk> <unk> <unk> big <unk> 
remember, in order to <unk> we need <unk> and <unk> 
are your hands always this <unk> 
i have something to
to whom you <unk> 
nobody else should matter. 
you want me to
relax. 
you're doing great.

we could stay here, too, right? 
maybe we should send <unk> to a <unk> 
i know how kids feel when their parents
you know what that means. 
i know what happened to
mr. <unk> you have to understand that <unk> are
we shall <unk> all <unk> 
every <unk> is <unk>
we live in a <unk> where old people eventually find out
what's your <unk>
why are you
there's another doctor here at the hospital. 
i think he can do better than dr.

let's do some <unk>
let's get a <unk> and figure out which one of
order <unk> and <unk> vital <unk> 
i'm not sure exactly what caused it, but right now, i'm <unk> 
the question is, what caused it? 
and why no <unk> 
if you want to make any more <unk> about it, just
no, that won't be
well, having said that we don't have to sit around and
<unk> 
we've just done a series of tests and we'll do more. 
it's just that right now is shooting at <unk> <unk> 
i appreciate your <unk> doctor.
but those tests took a long time, huh? 
if we stay here a while, <unk> will be able to get him
and i'll check in and see him twice a day. 
i'm going to move in here with
i'm afraid that's completely <unk> 
how long do you think you can
i don't
i'm leaving once a day.

you're the only one who can get it
why don't you take her
i can't explain it
maybe i should be there when it ends. 
i don't
to prove he was still here. 
to prove i was his son. 
what more could you possibly have done? 
<unk> that man got up every day of his life and went to
i never touched her.
he did it because he was sick, and he had no
you never asked yourself whether you were happy or happy. 
i didn't even know if he had the right.
and when he finds out about this <unk> you're gonna believe him, and
but i <unk> it. 
john. 
i was nice to him, but my mother <unk> him.
i can't talk right now.
i'm here because i have a marriage that is bad, i have a job in <unk> and i have a son who barely
maybe this will be hard for me 
but i'll be there when
and i killed her, and i covered her up.
and i'm gonna change the gold at that moment.
i owe him that.
when did you come to
i've never been.

you can't do that,
all tests are <unk> vital <unk> 
and this is a healthy human being. 
i've seen people <unk> before.

let's say you're stuck in a <unk> 
if you do that, you will be able to
thank god. 
<unk> i'm telling you, she's right. 
you risked <unk> 
maybe you should. 
and to what do i owe the
i am the forbidden <unk> and imagine that you are the <unk>
the third person to tell me something about <unk> 
maybe you just started hearing it <unk> 
now... 
don't make me laugh again.
this time, don't forget, you're not the only one who can
for obvious <unk> we can't have you <unk> through the
what <unk> 
i promised them i'd pay first. 
i admit you are <unk> 
start <unk> then. 
there's a new player on the stage.
<unk> is also a known <unk> 
<unk> hired him to build his weapons for <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> 
i don't understand why the news hasn't heard
this is a different
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> you're <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> 
looks like <unk> got himself a new <unk> 
keep watching him. 
see if he <unk> 
and <unk> 
then you can go to hell for all your
along with the rest of
<unk> 
yeah, you too. 
a good <unk> needs to be <unk> <unk> 
when the bad guy comes at you, you start a new line that
until he <unk> my <unk> or until you <unk> me? 
i didn't ask you to put a hole in
i want <unk> <unk>
you can't do that,
<unk> not always around to protect women. 
besides, what if you're not the guy i should
it could happen. 
okay. 
force the man to <unk> and he is <unk> his own
the <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> a little <unk> 
ready!

no one wants that.
<unk> 
this time, i hope you stay out of

this is the second time you've brought us back
our pleasure. 
for <unk> means he had nothing to do with it. 
good boy. 
in the meantime, get
why don't you try listening instead of <unk> that fat mouth of yours? 
you were the captain of the <unk> team, weren't
well, at least you
<unk> the part where you buy a <unk> <unk> to
i'm so proud of
never hurts to be ready. 
if you think <unk> can help you, why not?
i was joking.
<unk> if you want to get to know <unk> maybe the next time you have her over for dinner you won't ask the rest
i mean, i...
is it that <unk> 
i don't think the others
still, the last thing any of us should be doing is be a
office <unk> even under normal <unk> 
we live under normal circumstances. 
what are the odds of any of us finding someone who can deal with
i don't know, maybe it's
being a <unk> 
i didn't want to be
<unk> tell him that you don't like
this murder happened a week ago. 
why are you telling me this now?
how did you get these?
they call you police? 
usually when the victim is <unk> they use these.
he told her she was
i'm trying to get him
well, it worked. 
<unk> <unk> 20 minutes ago, kim <unk> 
what? 
okay, he's nice. 
and who is he?
are you sure it's him?
if you see one of her <unk> <unk> you
yeah, that's him. 
now we know why the <unk> gave me the death
she died because of me.
<unk> if he's somehow <unk> then so am i. 
<unk> 
hey. 
whatever you're doing right now, you're not responsible for this, and neither am i. 
but i know who you
i was a little <unk>
long day at the office.
<unk> <unk> 
i didn't write that.
i know he has some powers of his
billy definitely didn't believe me and you believed him. 
this <unk> is the most important part of
east <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> won't do anything to
it's not like some <unk> <unk> 
stay away from my
i don't think it's going to be very good
how about we pretend to be in here <unk> 
all right, you wanna go next? 
i think we should stay
why doesn't it surprise me that i can walk in
as far as i'm concerned, you have
i've never kissed a woman in my life.
i just love <unk>
<unk> 
really? 
you <unk> me.
we're taking you in for <unk> 
<unk> read him his rights.
who are you?
nobody. 
there's a woman who never <unk> at you wearing a <unk>
yeah, <unk> million in a prison cell in <unk> 
yeah, but for how long? 
an <unk> <unk> of <unk> in a demon <unk> couldn't do much, so my guess, regular <unk> not really a problem. 
what are you gonna
you can't just <unk> into a police station.
there's been an accident.
before i hit him, i had no idea what the woman
i don't think it's a bad idea to have a look at the
<unk> some of it is his. 
not human. 
he's headed this way.
i'll take a sample and see what sort of person billy is.
i'll take care of a
<unk> daily <unk> 
<unk> 
i don't think you should
how did you
i managed to get a <unk> of
maybe we can figure out which demon is in the <unk> and figure
can you hand me the glass <unk>
thank you. 
are you going to invite me in?
please, come in. 
i want you to show
<unk> tell <unk> everything. 
what makes you think i'd do that?
after all, it's your fault. 
i can tell you right away from
i don't take sides in
<unk> feels responsible for this kid because he brought him back to <unk> 
i feel responsible because he did it to save me. 
you are in charge of this, and you can't do anything because you're a <unk>
<unk> <unk> 
<unk> this spring is not <unk> 
billy <unk> <unk> people. 
then why are you wearing a <unk>
others can take hours. 
god, i hope you're starting to feel angry with
really <unk> 
i have to find
and i can't help you, why? 
do you remember the guy that you used to
you know, what he did to me was what
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
it's about <unk> 
there's definitely something you can do to stop this. 
that your life was suddenly <unk> by someone else. 
and if a woman strong enough to hide her <unk> she will never
where's billy at?
i understand why the <unk> <unk> did it. 
there's a reason, right? 
how many times do you want to talk about
did i wake you?
probably sitting in the back telling him how to drive. 
you know these <unk>
he probably deserved it. 
as i was
<unk> <unk> here. 
hey, <unk> 
billy. 
i didn't know you
i thought we agreed that you weren't gonna come here anymore after
do you want to, or should i? 
looks like some of the <unk> are kind of
these are most likely from the <unk> demon <unk> 
so it looks like <unk> was trying to get people
which means it could be <unk> or <unk> or even <unk> 
where's <unk> <unk> <unk> 
when <unk> came out, i thought she was out because i was having
well, i <unk> 
lying to me again will be a serious problem. 
sit down, <unk>
there's something we need to talk about.
i'm sorry i didn't tell you <unk>
we still have to make some changes around here.
change can be good, i

you leave your girlfriend alone with her <unk> and don't let her touch you. 
when you want money, leave it on the

let's finish this. 
i'm sorry, <unk>
you're sorry? 
you were right about me loving dark places for
but you forgot i also love <unk> <unk> 
i don't understand either.
i mean, you're a <unk> but why didn't <unk> call you when he
maybe because i'm not human.
and a vampire never <unk> his <unk> 
you know that stuff that the other <unk> have been
it was always about the pain and the
i guess you could say your <unk> makes you less <unk> than
like a noble man.

was <unk> always like <unk> 
the days after the <unk> were filled with
<unk> blood <unk> over the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
does <unk> share the same <unk> 
to <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> is losing his mind, trying to make you
if i were only able to protect my own people, perhaps
<unk> <unk> was heading towards <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
a <unk> named <unk> was found <unk> <unk> to the <unk> 
offer <unk> with <unk> <unk> 
i don't know how you can support a case based on
if he had that kind of <unk> why would he be
we can't afford to go to <unk>
and i will not stand by and say hello to a <unk>
you can't seriously be thinking of taking that offer.
<unk> wants to know what he knows about <unk> so he doesn't deserve
and when the time comes, we will take revenge for those
we're still <unk> ourselves in the warm <unk> of
and use it to comfort the right <unk> of death.
each drop of <unk> blood comes from us to meet
i'm here with professor charles <unk> a <unk> <unk> who <unk> for the fbi.

you know that <unk> game where you shoot a <unk> gun into the mouth of
an <unk> threat <unk> will <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of each <unk> just like the <unk> in the game <unk>
we need to figure out where <unk> <unk> has been until the
when <unk> broke up with him, we <unk> him. 
<unk> <unk> been making a lot of noise lately.
hello, charlie. 
your father <unk> in his <unk> <unk> the other day.

<unk> team found some <unk> in her office. 
<unk> <unk> angry <unk> 
yeah, i'm on my way down to

<unk> <unk> 
can we discuss this here and not here? 
<unk> it's for
you and my mother worked so hard to give her something big, you know. 
i'm starting to believe that this could work.
and to the end of the <unk> a <unk> <unk> makes <unk> look like
she was trying to make room for the <unk> and she was speaking with <unk> <unk>
i'm still working on
the <unk> <unk> what we <unk> and what we <unk> that's the problem. 
i told your dad i'd make a
and how long does it take to see the power <unk>
it is, isn't it?
you don't know how much i love this.
you either have a lot of <unk> or your brain is too
<unk> <unk> <unk>

he thought <unk> would come for me. 
no matter how bad it is, david, you're <unk> and don <unk> and you walked in that door. 
because i would have done the same for the first time in my
yeah, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> all the
if you <unk> a certain amount of strength down your <unk> when he <unk> a force that will <unk> them from
it also helps the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> all the <unk> <unk> into the water.
i was gonna buy that <unk> and sell
facial <unk> probably.

it's nothing but a personal <unk> 
it's not just <unk> and <unk> 
and the soul of all that master <unk> is a beauty and <unk> 
<unk> 
all i'm saying is you think i'm a <unk> 
you know, better than that. 
what do you do exactly? 
nobody likes <unk>
