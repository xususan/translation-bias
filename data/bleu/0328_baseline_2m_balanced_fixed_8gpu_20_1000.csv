michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, he shared his bed with his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think you and i are fit together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i will.
i need to write a 000-word essay about the moral side of the war and the advancement of a conflict.
i'm not sure our ethics teacher would like me to cheat when i'm writing a test.
so, you passed my ethics test.
in fact,georgemichael was desperately burned to her teacher, the ethics teacher at bethbaerly.
small crimes can be slaughtered even the hands of people who commit little crimes.
no ring ring ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
g.d.k.'s eye was upon us.
your father thought it would make us look more charitable.
he must have imitated my signature.
'maybe a year ago,'i'll have a son... who'd finished the sinking cheese!
you have to get me out of this.
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't take care of her
and i don't have a mother's compassion and milk any
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yes-yes.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
meanwhile, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
why am i telling you this?
i guess there's some things that you can't tell your father
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set up his teacher's dad... to help him do his maternal duty.
there's nothing wrong with that.
however, i must say that i'm a little hurt that you don't think about it.
and the aunts can do this.
teachers can do that too.
sure, someday, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay's never been so proud of what she said all her life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i keep telling you about.
she's really... a young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma," you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache
yeah.
but gob mistook michael's affection for decency, and he felt like he was fighting to get involved.
because, you know, beyond adorability... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
_
and george sr. was about to come to a surprise visit.
i've read all your teachings and bought all your tapes.
and i watched it all over again.
george sr. had recently sold a series of tapes he had recently offered to people... to make money for his new spirituality.
i also lost two pounds by eating your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to find out where
this is a nice place to start.
and after michael got rid of the two girls he'd made a date with, lindsay met at the parent-teacher night.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this bedroom have the same floor plan as our kitchen?
i think he's very fit for you.
i thought this would help you get the concept of motherhood out of your head.
besides, i can't hurry up and marry someone just because my son wants to.
i'm mrs. baerly, the ethics
my goal is to make my students appreciate the importance of life... that could be the result of an unthinkingly triggered
and michael began to know his son's ethics teacher.
and that's the "rrrrrr" part of
you know, it's very annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you were laughing.
"rrrr!" - "rrrrr!" - "r
but, you know, i'm gonna
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite her to have a drink?
or... or...
yeah, he's dead
i think that mr. daniels having a stroke with...
let's go get a drink.
yeah, maybe it will help.
george sr. was dealing with his own admirer.
i've already told you many of my sins.
maybe you could tell me a few sins.
well, there are legal indicators that show my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me about one of those things that happened... again at the university dorm.
and what's his meeting with mrs. bayerly, the second date today...
michael, this little korean has come, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think that's him.
you're gonna have to peel her to freeze to say something
yes, mama.
they'll take her back.
don't take your shoes off, little man!
don't take your shoes off!
he's out of
who is it?
this "annong" is your father and i have adopted.
what, i'm leaving for a few days and you find a new son?
lucille buster realized she was worried, even jealous.
and she understood how it felt to be ignored.
annyong is your brother now, anny
cancel it.
it stays.
listen, i'll call you sonar again.
nice driving.
are you making dinner reservations?
a "little korean" did it.
and after the meetings...
michael's been a step he hasn't
well, do you think this is a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we get inside without waking everyone up?
this may not be my best idea so far.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i loved.
and i took someone you liked.
i'm like, "nashbaggerbagerlajam
listen, i know you're trying to get revenge on marta case.
i was lying to you when i said i wouldn't try to sleep with her, so...
he has to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
that's
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
seriously, i had a chance to get rid of him.
it's ok
very romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but first, i don't know it was real.
but now, your... moral teacher...
yeah, i did that for him.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, as a matter of fact, i'm sure you're interested in her.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
is this about your class?
i mean, she loved him... that he loved
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was she doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with her.
well, why would he do that?
why did he sleep with my ethics teacher?
you and i know that, but gob just...
he's not one of the good shooters that targeted his target, and he's almost everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
she's been accompanying the strange dance girls... and i thought i'd go see her and, uh, do, uh, do,
"hey, you want to dance?"
and that's what i thought was gonna happen, "what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it differently in the mirror, but...
but, you know, you know, we were dancing with a joke or something.
i didn't think so details.
don't you think you should go out with someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've taken a very difficult book to find a picture of saddam disappointment in a bathing suit.
"what would saddam do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's just like our fire escape.
in prison, george sr. was preparing for the evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon was making his own preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael is still angry with gob... and yet he went to find the family expert in making trouble.
i know you went out with shannon.
with that cheerleader?
yeah, she's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different
i wish i had someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and i asked him... but he was breathing and he dropped the phone.
i never heard back.
you know, maybe we should both go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hello.
my mother took it.
he's making me tape him to school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss george michael's condition with mrs. bearly.
i'm sorry.
hey.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality...
you see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's like, she's in love with you, so
he knows we're leaving.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most unnatural thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been an ethics teacher for half a
look, that was preemptive.
my brother was trying to sleep with you.
then i want to leave you right now and i'm not coming back to you.
i see.
from now on.
george sr. went for a walk with cindi.
george.
and she's getting to know him
you can totally spill your guts at me here.
it's weighting my soul
you, you,
she's picking up the camera
(i'm taking her to the grand dance, this is your dinner, so she's away with mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy
watch your back, my migrant little brother!
and spring dance was the last pace.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting her in because she doesn't have the perfect-shaped nose, circle-shaped eyes, the strong square jaw.
do you want to dance?
all right!
finally found shannon, gob called...
gobun found out he was cheating on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i ruined our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about this for a long time, and-and
that's... that's your right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing at a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, my ethics teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
after being so mean to you, it really made me feel compelled to try to protect me.
in fact, gob confuses michael's ethics teacher... with his civics teacher.
man, he's got... the type.
gob, miss whitehead was a citizen tutor.
second movement.
i've been seeing mrs. baerly, and i should never have brought gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never wanted to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed at some sad things, but...
i don't think we're gonna have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm getting that cake.
hey, you want to dance?
i can't believe this is working.
the next arrested development.
buster's cheque would make him angry.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
no candles allowed here.
my mom's going crazy.
no, it's okay.
i'm burning my own candle.
yeah, that's what i'm gonna do
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you with these?
it's ok
right here, i'll help you.
these?
okay, here, let me carry it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
that's what you're suggesting, connie, it'
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die
we're all going one day, right?
four months ago, each of you attended an interview to join a never-before-seen tv show.
and guess what?
you win.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm totally gay, and i'm proud of
you're sweet, aren't you
i want to rule our country.
next question.

he doesn't know
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.

these days, barack looks like obama.
each of you will earn $00,000.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
damn it!
great.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know if this is a donkey joke?
that's
actually, it's our third show, but we're not gonna publish until the fall
you're gonna have to play and earn the money to see if this is a prank or not.
you will be asked to perform a series of tasks.
the missions will force your borders, your courage and your thought.
sounds like fun, doesn't it?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i didn't have a girlfriend to admit that even with her head
i have to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
stick around.
you'll find out.
the total amount of money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if you all make it through the night, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can spend the night here for me.
does anyone else want to join her?
i'm not.
there's no way i'm going to the city with this
i'm in
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him
goodbye.
you're an idiot.
it's a damn party joke, they're gonna fuck you.
you don't look like a bunch of idiots.
don't you see this is a record party?
or we'll be famous.
there's a human head in there!
don't worry, it's not
it seemed pretty real to me.
that's why they call it special effects.
it's nice, isn
a little sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thank you to our award-winning special effects team.
follow me, fellas.
in the warm swamp water, lazy crocodiles are waiting for their prey.
the indian crocodiles are long and benign.
to such crocodiles...
guys.
i see you're working hard as usual.
are we ready?
we're all set
and absolutely.
keep it up.
yes, sir.
hey.
great job scaring them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are joining the show.
you seemed really scared.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really gives me the creeps when
did you know that?
the dead homeless?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
it must be a big coincidence.
do you really think it's safe there?
it's safe enough for the show to be insured.
any other questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're rolling.
each of you has been chosen by your own free will to spend the night in prison to earn $00,000.
it's clear enough, isn'
all right, let the party begin.
you can find everything you need in your base camp, that's the manager's office.
where is he
it's compl
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you've taken all our clothes, how can we write?
go down the hall, turn right again, left.
straight down the stairs, left, right, and one more left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
there you will find a key to get you out of your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought leaving the basement was terrible.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where is she going?
welcome to the mission.
can you not do that?
i don't see a damn thing here.
does anyone remember where we're going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, right twice, then left.
there's too many straight walks
no, go down the hall, straight down the hall,
"turn to the water, do it right again, and to the left
"then straight down the stairs, then straight down the st
"sola, right, and left again."
what are you?
smart.
_
careful.

oh, my god
what is this place?
and be ready.
it was fun.
let's speed them up a little
yes, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
damn it.
i don't
the power's running low, the generator should've come in.
damn it!

strange, isn't it?
be careful!

here we are.
we're here

i think he's the manager

okay, yeah.
look at this.
what's up, man?
"hello, brave contestants.
"welcome to warden clem harvis's office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room
"this chess stones will determine your personal role.
"you cannot change your stones with the other contestants.
"jillas were her favorite".
"now it's your turn to put your hand in the box."
oh, shit.
well, who wants first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't
what do you mean you don't know
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black fort.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
damn it!
that was really sick.
my little piggies, welcome to the task.
now let me tell you about the pennyville state prison.
in the time of crisis in 0000, when the cost was up, the ruthless warden decided to raise his fortune by destroying certain expenses.
these were their prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the director's crimes were released.
the last person here was sentenced to the death penalty was director harvis himself.
rumor has it that the manager's still walking down the halls.
tonight, you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured souls under this building.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
does anyone want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the prison church to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first hallway.
the sound job is awesome
thank you.
damn it!
what is it?
they turned off my flashlight.
i can't see anything.
okay, calm down, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung the babies!
their children... their
i think they've got it covered with speakers.
sounds are more effective than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
oh, my god
that sounds lovely.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't
there's a sound
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're calling me on speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flashlight.
all right, now?
open the bible to the marked page...
"you will find the lord's prayer there.
"00 years ago, the holy place was done with no respect for this place,
"now this is the room of unusual events."
oh, my... "in reverse."
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit
i can't do
"when you complete your mission...
"if there's no sign of the director,
you can go back to camp.
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry, whoever i'm bothering
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
"to protect us from evil...
"our father in the mountains...
"don't let evil lead us.
"to protect us from overcome...
"give us our debts, as we forgive those who owe us.
"and give us our daily bread today.
"as it is in heaven...
"as in the sky,
"for thy kingdom and dominion are yours."
please tell me i can go now.
"before you go to camp"
oh, my god, randall, you should blow out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit down there for a minute.
look what they're made for money
where'd she go?
i understand that the people who did this work cut our connection to our homo friend for a little while to give our homo friend a more scary weather.
whatever.
absolutely, she's gone in a j
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, man, it's not that bad.
it's definitely not worth the
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it
they can give you another assignment.
no kidding.
i swear you don't even know how you feel there.
it's like you're walking through a thick fog, just cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
yeah, she's right.
i want to go next.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated
we'll send scelzi downstairs and have her look, you'll fix it.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen
it's too
we need to talk.
i'm busy
we can either talk or i'll go or
it's important to me too, taylor
what do you mean?
i had a little research done.
by "do not disturb" you mean the local girl you slept with?
am i right?
big lips, wide hips, taylor.
okay, the prison isn't just for the
do the women have division?
and that damn crazy manager would go naked around the women's department and never answer anyone.
he beat them up, raped them, knocked them down, and starved them to death.
they say she's been feeding some of her own bab
what's that supposed to mean?
what do i mean?
this true story will increase interest in the show!
everyone could be talking about us.
it's nothing compared to the facts you made up.
i agree.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do that, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
is that so?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they are.
nice.
scelzi, what's that?
it's just a little something to get me through the night.
you want some?
just get your hairy ass over here, okay?
yes, captain.
hello?
you scared the shit out of me.
i've got a pretty good stuff
suit yourself.
we're all ready to begin.
i'd say my biggest fear was being buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will put you in the freedom zone".
okay,
i'm at the end of the freedom
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
damn it!
what?
blood.
it's not real
no cursing, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me you're upstairs, not down the stairs.
i'm sorry
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down there, you're gonna see a finger
he says...
damn it!
"welcome to cell number five.
"as we consider the violence and insanity,
oh, shit.
tell me what to do and i'll get out of this hell right now.
no!
thank you.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a prisoner fails to commit suicide and fails to
"you will now live the penalty for a prisoner."
okay, where's the
under your foot.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult mission.
"you'll be told what you'll do when you'
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my job.
connie.
what?
check this out.
what?
oh, no...
you're fired.
why not?
you went behind my back, and i specifically told you, you added something to the show, and you're asking why you were fired?
this is not our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't
don't look at me.
look, connie, you gotta get that guy out, okay?
he's gonna fuck
damn it!
we'll be ruined.
so you didn't bring this?
not with a cut.
it's obvious
what's so obvious?
come closer.
i asked you why you put a camera in the control room.
yeah.
the camera back... they want to record the footage...
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
it's genius, isn
it's absolutely gen
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to film how he scares us by putting something into the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black king and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you could do another mission.
well, that's
okay, black king and white horse turn right and go to the gas chamber.
white queen and black horse go straight, and they go to prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"the hawk and the left first, turn right.
"rok and go to the end of the hallway,
"and come down the stairwell".
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, open it.
we're in.
"welcome to the gathering room.
there must be a light on the wall behind you, turn it on.
"black king and white horse enter the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
that place deserved the best, it was the real place.
it's the only place the legal department has
nice, isn't
it's pretty creepy
oh, my god
what's that smell?
a documented real death chamber is often carried by death's own smell.
of course, the smell isn't really
if a man knows that his life's last moments, his concern has come to the end, it'll cause an epidemic of smell.
in that case, the smell of the human smell we're breathing is the smell of the gas that killed him.
it's time for fun, ladies and
he's sitting in the black king's
black king?
that would be me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you will find some meat and a ceiling.
"you're gonna cook this meat and eat
man!
the prisoners are always nerd, pig...
"or there is no lamb and there is no lamb...
"that they suspected.
"they thought they'd never tasted before, that it's a nice
you're talking about human flesh, aren't you
are you inside?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i gave up.
you'll connect toni.
i'm transferring you from here, before toni's gas can be accelerated, the fear of the prisoners must be fully lived
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends had some weird desires.
are you okay?
okay.
"your mission is the gas teammate...
"to find the main valve and cut the gas before it kills the
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to throw up.
okay.
strange.
i can't do
i can't
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
no more prank.
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they'll pay extra money."
