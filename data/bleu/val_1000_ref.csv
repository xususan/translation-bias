michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, it was with his younger brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think us sleeping together is working out.
yeah, i miss mom.
i can tell.
i'm supposed to write 200 words on the morality of war... whether a preemptive strike is ever justified.
i'm not sure if my ethics teacher would love if i cheated on my essay.
well, you just passed my ethics test.
[narrator] in fact, george michael had developed a hopeless crush... on his ethics teacher, a woman named beth baerly.
even minor crimes are punishable... by brutally chopping off the offender's hand.
no ring.
try to remember everything she says about me, all right?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
did you and dad adopt a child?
the s.e.c. was onto us.
your father thought it would make us look charitable.
he must have forged my signature.
well, maybe i'll get a son who will... finish his cottage cheese.!
you've got to get me out of this.
i'll call social services, but you must take buster back.
but i'm not taking care of him either.
i don't have the milk of mother's kindness in me anymore.
hello.
{ gob] michael.
i've got a couple of girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
so we had a little disagreement.
i'm offering you an olive branch here.
yeah-yeah.
besides, when was the last time you slept with someone?
[narrator] meanwhile, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
well, i don't know why i'm telling you this.
i guess there's just some things you can't really say to your dad.
[narrator] lindsay believed that george michael wanted to fix up his father... so he could fill the role ofhis mother.
there's nothing wrong with that.
although, i must say i'm a little hurt that you haven't considered me.
aunts can fill that role.
teachers can fill that role.
and, someday, you're gonna find the right woman to fill that role.
but until then, i'll be right across the hall.
[narrator] lindsay had never been more proud of anything she had said in her entire life.
[narrator] meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to show up.
this is shannon, the girl i've been telling you all about.
girl, indeed... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and so she's your date.
"oh... { laughs] ""nagarma,"" you've got a mustache."
i mean, you've got a milk mustache.
yeah.
[narrator] but gob mistook michael's basic human decency for romantic interest... and felt a competitive urge to step in.
because, you know, it's beyond adorable... and e-exotic.
i find you very attractive.
{ nazhgalia, michael, shannon] really?
[narrator] and george sr. was about to get a surprise visitor.
i've studied all your teachings, and i've purchased every tape.
and i watch 'em over and over.
[narrator] george sr. had recently marketed a line of self-help tapes... touting his newly discovered spirituality.
i've also lost four pounds on your low-carb bluth banana jail bars. { giggles]
i've come to learn at your feet.
that's a good place to start.
[narrator] and michael, free ofhis double date, met lindsay at parent-teacher night.
hey, linds, is it my imagination... or does this rape room have the same floor plan as our kitchen?
well, i think she's perfect for you.
you'd think that would turn him off to the entire concept.
besides, i'm not gonna rush out and marry somebody just because you think my son would like it.
i'm ms. baerly, the ethics teacher.
my goal is to teach your children about the preciousness oflife... that can be lost by the mindless pulling of a trigger.
[narrator] and so michael got to know his son's ethics teacher.
"i guess that's the ""rrrr"" of it."
you know, so frustrating.
i mean, they just threw this class at me after mr. daniels had a stroke.
thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing 'cause you were laughing.
"""rrrr!"" - { laughs] ""rrrr!"""
but, you know, l-l...
and i think i'm an ethical person.
right.
here's an ethical question.
can-can a parent take a teacher out for a drink?
or...
yeah, she died.
well, it's the mr. daniels stroke thing...
let's go get that drink.
yeah, it could only help.
[narrator] george sr. was dealing with his own admirer.
oh, i've already told you so many of my sins.
maybe you could tell me some of yours.
uh, well, there are legal implications to that.
but, uh, back to your sins.
uh, do that one about the, uh... { takes deep breath] ladies' shower... in your college dorm again.
[narrator] and michael was on his way to what would be his second date...
michael, the little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with him.
at least, i think it's a him.
you've got to strip them down to next to nothing before you can even tell.
yeah, mom.
they will take him back.
shoes on, mister.!
shoes on.!
he's out of control.
who's that?
"this is ""annyong,"" who your father and i have adopted."
what, i'm gone for a couple days and you find a new son?
[narrator] lucille could see that her son was concerned, even jealous.
and she knew how it felt to be overlooked.
annyong is your brother now.
call it off.
i'm keeping him.
look, i gotta call you back.
sweet ride.
are you making dinner reservations?
"a ""little korean"" dropped off."
[narrator] and after their date...
michael took a step he hadn't taken in years.
okay, do you think this is a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mmm.
such a good idea.
but how are we going to sneak in without waking everyone up?
this may not have been my best idea.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but it looks like we're even.
you took something i liked.
i took something you liked.
"i... { beeps]...""nashbagerlajam."""
listen, i know that you've been trying to get even with me about marta.
i was lying when i said i wasn't gonna to sleep with her, so...
she'd have to agree to it.
i don't anticipate a problem with that.
right.
i just slept with one.
again, didn't like nazhgalia.
really, and good luck getting rid of her.
not a problem.
oh, so romantic.
"who's ""n. bahn-ahden?"""
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something before, but i didn't know if it was real.
but now, uh... your ethics teacher...
yeah, i just made this for her.
oh.
she loves saddam hussein.
i'm sure she is interested in him... as a subject, you know.
i'm sure she doesn't love saddam.
you know, i just wanted to make her something special to show that i care.
about the class?
you mean, you love her like...
hi, george michael.
i'm gonna go home and think about it.
i'm gonna go home, think about it.
dad, what was she doing here?
[narrator] michael knew he had an ethical responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yes.
your uncle gob slept with her.
well, why would he do that?
why would gob sleep with my ethics teacher?
you and i know that, but gob he just...
he's not that exact of a target shooter, and he just kind of sprays it everywhere.
you know, but listen, did-did you really think that-that... that you had a...
i mean, she's kinda old for you, don't you think?
we don't even know how old she is.
no one does.
she was chaperoning the diversity dance... and i thought maybe as a joke, i'd go up to her and be, like...
"""well, hey, do you want to dance?"""
"and she'd be, like, ""ah, what the heck?"" right?"
i did it differently in the mirror, but...
but, you know, like, we'd be joke dancing or something.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should be taking somebody your own age?
like your cousin.
i defaced a rare book to get that picture of saddam hussein in a bathing suit.
"""what would saddam do?"""
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that is our exact outdoor fire pit.
[narrator] at prison, george sr. was preparing for an evening with his most devoted fan.
while cindi lightballoon was making preparations ofher own.
how we doin'?
[man] we have video.
[narrator] so george michael, still angry at gob... sought out the family expert on making trouble.
i know he was dating that girl shannon.
the cheerleader?
yeah, she's probably gonna take him to that stupid diversity dance.
i wish i had someone shocking to take.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and asked him... but he got all out of breath and dropped the phone.
i never heard back.
you know, may-maybe we should go together.
right, i mean, it's a bad example...
hello.
my mom bought him.
she's making me register him for school.
he's my new little brother.
so we're related.
[narrator] and michael went to discuss the george michael situation with ms. baerly.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
you mean, you're interested in him.
this is what i want to talk to you about, though.
but i've enjoyed my time with you.
you ever wanna talk ethics...
you see, george michael made this poster for you.
you know, he-he kind of, uh, is in love with you, so...
he knows we're going out.
i told him that you slept with my brother.
that may be the most unethical thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been doing this half a semester.
look, it was a preemptive strike.
my brother would've tried to sleep with you.
well, i want you to leave right now and not come back.
i understand.
starting right now.
[narrator] george sr. went on a walk with cindi.
george.
and she was getting to him.
you can feel safe to fully reveal yourself to me.
{ sighs] it's weighing heavy on my soul.
you, uh...
he's pinching the camera.
so, it's off with mother now.
[narrator] in fact, lucille was just giving annyong and maeby a ride.
you're trying to steal from the wrong man.
watch your back, my little immigrant friend!
[narrator] and the spring diversity dance was in full swing.
whoa, sorry.
so you're not letting him in because he doesn't share your perfectly shaped nose... your round eye-shaped eyes, your strong square jaw.
you wanna dance?
all right!
[narrator] and gob sought out shannon...
who had found out he had cheated on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
oh, hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
look, i blew it, okay?
beth.!
um, i blew it okay?
i had to see you.
l-i've been giving this a lot of thought, and-and...
oh, that's... that's your definition of the right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing at a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girl.
yeah, my ethics teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
i'm really touched that you'd stick up for me after i've been so horrible to you.
[narrator] in fact, gob mistook the civics teacher... for the ethics teacher michael was dating.
man, he... has a type.
gob, mrs. whitehead was the civics teacher.
two strikes.
l-i've been seeing ms. baerly, and i should never have brought gob into it.
but that day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never wanted to hurt you.
i didn't know you were that serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
i'm just saying someday, you know.
i'm not really into kids.
the lady said no, man.
look, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean we had some laughs about some very sad things, but...
i don't think we have a future.
and, jeremy, i will take that cupcake.
hey, uh, you wanna dance?
i can't believe that would have worked.
on the next arrested development.
buster's competition heats up.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.!
we are not allowed to have candles in here.
mom would freak.
oh, no, it's fine.
i'll light a candle of my own.
that's exactly what i'll do.
you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, that's all right.
really, it is.
you want me to help you out with this?
no problem.
here, let me just help you out here.
these, too?
okay, here, let me get that for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're proposing, connie, is, to say the very least, extreme.
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
move, move, move!
what are you doing?
get off me.
i don't wanna die.
we all gotta go sometime, huh?
four months ago, each of you little piggies attended auditions to be on a never-before-seen reality tv game show.
and guess what?
you won.
i think, in life, some people are meant to be on tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm totally off-the-hook gay and proud of it.
you're a cutie, aren't you?
i wanna lead our country.
next question.
my name is angel, on loan from england.
me, too.
he's my brother stanton/parole officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother dropped him on his head.
and he doesn't know.
well, but i do.
"dixon, 6'2"", 200 pounds."
you know, people used to say i look like will smith.
now they say barack obama.
to win $20,000 each, all you have to do is spend one night in a prison.
that abandoned prison.
whoa.
holy shit!
cool.
how come i've never heard of this show?
like, how do we know this is not some sort of frat house prank?
right.
this is actually our third show, but we won't be on-air until the fall.
and as for knowing if this is anything more than a college prank, you'll just have to play for the money to find out.
you'll be asked to perform a series of tasks.
tasks that will test your nerves, your courage and your sanity.
sounds like fun, right?
what kind of task are we talking about, dawg?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i can't have no girl do this while i take off.
i have to look after my baby sister.
i'm in.
you guys are insane.
do any of you know the history of that prison?
some really fucked up shit went down in there.
like what?
stick around.
you'll find out.
the total money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if all of you make it through the night, there will be a substantial bonus.
ain't enough money in the world to make me stay in that place.
anybody else wanna join him?
not me.
well, there's no way i'm riding all the way back to the city with urine boy.
oh, i'm in.
just get me the hell out of here.
your chariot awaits.
unlock him.
bye.
you guys are idiots.
this is for some fucking frat party joke and you're all gonna be made fun of.
you're all gonna look like a bunch of losers.
can't you just see this video playing at a party?
or we get famous.
there's a freaking human head in there!
don't worry, it's not real.
sure as hell looks real to me.
"what we in the business like to call a ""special effect""."
pretty cool, huh?
a little taste of what's waiting for you in there.
thanks to our award-winning special effects team.
follow me, my friends.
in the warm, swampy water, lazy crocodiles wait for the next meal.
the indian crocodiles have long, pointed faces.
these crocodiles are called...
boys.
i see you're working hard as usual.
are we ready?
totally ready.
totally and absolutely.
let's keep it that way.
yes, ma'am.
hey.
great job selling the fear out there, man.
yeah.
i can't believe any of those kids stuck around for the show.
you actually looked like you were terrified out there.
well, that's because i am.
i mean, first of all, just looking at that place totally creeps me out.
did you know about that?
about the dead homeless people?
sure.
why didn't you say anything?
that's kind of a lot of people for a coincidence.
i mean, do you really think it's safe in there?
safe enough to get the show insured.
any more questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like a baby.
let's do this.
okay.
we are filming.
all of you have chosen, of your own free will, to spend the night in this prison for the chance to win $20,000 each.
pretty straight forward, right?
okay, then let's get this party started.
you'll find everything you need in your base camp, which is located in the warden's office.
where's that?
well, it's kind of complicated.
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you took away all of our possessions, so how are we supposed to write it down?
go straight down the hall, hang a right, another right, then a left.
then straight on up the first flight of stairs, a left, a right, then one more left.
you want me to say it again?
yeah.
too bad.
when you get there, you'll find the key to release you from those shackles.
is there anyone else inside?
we'll just have to wait and see.
i thought coming out of the closet was scary.
have fun, inmates.
good luck.
where's she going?
welcome to the task.
can you please not do that?
i can't see a damn thing in here.
does anybody remember which way he said to go?
it's straight, a right, then a left.
no, it's straight, two rights then a left.
"too many ""straights""."
"no, it's, ""go straight down the hall,"
"""hang a right, another right, a left."
"""then straight on up the first flight of stairs,"
"""a left, a right, and one more left""."
what are you?
she's smart.
guys, we're gonna have a great show.
careful.
careful.
jesus.
what is this place?
okay, and get ready.
that was fun.
and speed them up.
yes, my queen.
come on!
now go!
left turn.
why am i not seeing anything?
shit, shit, shit, shit.
well, i don't know.
the power's going down, the backup should've kicked in by now.
shit!
hurry!
it's a weird glitch, huh?
careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
damn, it's cold in here.
look, key.
hell yeah.
okay.
hey, guys, look.
yeah, come on.
cool.
all right, you.
who's that?
i guess it's the warden.
get this one.
okay, yeah.
hey, check this out.
what you got, man?
"""greetings, brave contestants."
"""welcome to warden clem harvis' personal office."
"""in the center of the room is a box."
"""this chess piece will determine your own personal symbol."
"""you cannot trade with any of the other contestants."
"""razor blades were a personal favorite""."
"""now, it's your turn to put your hand in the box""."
shit.
so, who wants to go first?
me.
what the hell is going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i mean, i don't know.
seriously?
you should have seen all of your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black rook.
white knight.
white queen.
hey, look.
holy shit!
okay, that is really fucking creepy.
welcome, my little piggies, to the task.
now, for a little history of pennyville state prison.
in 1931, with the climbing budgets during the depression, the cold blooded warden thought he could keep his fortune on track by eliminating certain overhead costs.
his inmates!
eventually the warden was exposed, but not before having executed 85 inmates!
the last person to be served a death sentence here was warden harvis himself.
rumor has it that the warden still roams the halls.
tonight, you will be asked to go face to face with the warden, and the tortured souls that still inhabit the building you are now in.
task one.
white queen.
try not to die!
does anybody want to trade?
hell no!
okay.
"""the white queen will got to the prison chapel to complete his task."
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
still in the first hallway.
nice job with the sound.
hey, thanks.
oh, shit.
what?
they turned my torch off.
i can't see a damn thing.
okay, take it easy, randall.
now, make a right and go straight.
there's babies hanging!
children's...
i imagine they have the place wired for audio input.
audio being more profound in tapping into our primal fears than sight.
is that right?
okay.
god!
sounds like a real sweetie.
no, i'm good, man.
freaking stoner.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
it was a sound.
i think someone's in the room with me.
they're using speakers, randall.
seriously.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flash light.
okay, now what?
"""open the bible to the marked page..."
"""where you'll find the lord's prayer."
"""having been desecrated 75 years ago,"
"""this once holy place is a likely hotspot of paranormal activity""."
"oh, my. ""in reverse""."
no way.
oh, hell no, man.
don't do that shit.
i can't do that.
"""once your task is completed..."
"""if there is no sign of the warden,"
"""you can return to base camp""."
deep breath, randall.
just do it.
please forgive me, whoever i may be pissing off.
this wasn't my idea.
okay.
"""evil from us deliver"
"""our father who art in heaven..."
"""but temptation into not us lead."
"""and us against trespass..."
"""who those forgive we as trespasses our us forgive."
"""and bread daily our day this us give."
"""heaven in is it..."
"""as earth on done be will thy,"
"""heaven in art who father our""."
please say i can leave now.
"""before you head to the base camp""..."
god, randall, you have to blow out the candle.
you're joking, right?
and sit there for one minute.
the things i do for money.
where'd he go?
it would be my estimation that the production has cut off our ability... to communicate with our homosexual friend... in order to create a more terrifying atmosphere.
whatever.
sure, like clockwork.
guys?
i think we got some really good stuff.
guys?
guys?
guys!
do you see anyone?
no.
come on, dude, it couldn't have been that bad.
totally not worth the money.
but having done it, it was totally worth the money.
oh, thank god i'm finished.
look at me, i'm still shaking.
i don't think i could handle doing it again.
they might ask you to do another one.
don't joke.
i swear you can feel some kind of twisted vibe out there.
it's like walking through heavy fog, only it's ice cold.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
yeah, she's right.
i want to go next.
what exactly do you mean,
"""there are some cameras down""?"
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but this is pretty complicated stuff.
we'll get scelzi to go down... and have a look and fix them.
scelzi.
yeah.
yeah, i need you to go down and have a look at some cameras.
yeah.
boys.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
well, we talk now or i walk.
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
well, i've been doing a little research.
"and by ""research,"" what you actually mean... is you've been fucking one of the local girls."
am i right?
loose lips sink ships, taylor.
okay, this prison didn't just have a men's wing, all right?
it had a women's wing, too, all right?
and the twisted fucking warden would roam around it, naked, answering to no one.
he beat them, he raped them, made them have his children, then he starved them to death.
people say he even fed some of them their own babies.
what's your point?
my point?
my point is that the real story would have made the show a hit!
everybody would've been talking about us.
the story you cranked out is nothing compared to the real one.
i agree.
so why didn't we use it?
because the town said they'd sue us if we did.
right.
are we done here?
yeah.
oh, yeah?
what's that?
anyway, i'm gonna go take a nap.
they on?
yep, they're on.
sweet.
scelzi, what was that?
just a little something to get me through the night.
do you want?
just get your hairy butt back here, okay?
aye, aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the shit out of me.
i've got some good stuff.
suit yourself.
we are totally ready to go.
i would have to say my biggest fear would be being buried alive.
where do i go next?
"""this will lead you to freedom row""."
all right,
i'm at the end of freedom row.
what do i do next?
tell him to go right again.
go straight on and then right.
oh, shit!
what?
blood.
it's not real blood.
no shit, sherlock.
i love that girl.
oh, man, please tell me i get to go up and not down.
sorry.
eighty paces?
who do i look like, a pirate?
you should see a metal door... once you've gone a flight down.
it says...
damn.
"""welcome to solitary confinement, cell number five."
"""for the violent and frequently insane,"
shit.
look, just tell me what i need to do... so i can get the hell out of here.
no!
thanks.
you guys ever get tired of complimenting each other?
the things i do.
"it says, ""if an inmate failed in his suicide attempt,"
"""you are to now re-enact the torture of a prisoner""."
okay, so where is it?
under your feet.
i mean, this thing is, like, full of shit in here.
money, money, money.
that's a pretty harsh task.
"""once in the hole, you are to await further instructions""."
okay.
hello?
hello?
hey, no offense, but i really hope you're not my task.
connie.
what?
take a look at this.
what?
that isn't...
you're fired.
why?
you go behind my back and you hire some extra to be in the show... when i specifically told you not to, and you wanna know why you're fired?
that's not my guy.
where'd he go?
who the fuck was that?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you've got to get that guy out of there, all right?
i mean, this is gonna screw up the show.
damn.
this is gonna kill us.
you're sure this isn't just you screwing around?
scout's honor.
it's so obvious.
what is so obvious?
come closer.
remember when i asked you... why you were having snow rig cameras in the control booth?
yeah.
the network wanted some guys in there... to shoot some behind-the-scenes...
fuck me!
fuck me!
you're right.
it's kind of genius, isn't it?
it's total genius.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
you mean to tell me that the network is throwing some twists into the game just to see how freaked out we get?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
go on with the show.
as planned.
task three.
black king and white knight.
task four.
black rook and white queen.
told you you might have to do another task.
smartass.
okay, black king and white knight are to turn right and make their way to the gas chamber.
white queen and black rook are to go straight and head to the prison kitchen.
okay, laters.
good luck.
"""king and knight go left and then right."
"""rook and the queen go to the end of the hall"
"""and take the stairwell down""."
scelzi, pick up.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, pick up.
we're in.
"""welcome to the gathering room."
you should see a light switch at the rear wall.
"""black king and white knight are to enter the gas chamber""."
again, nice set, connie.
can't take credit for that, it's the real deal.
only thing the legal department could clear.
cool, right?
well, it's scary all right.
christ!
what's that smell?
it is a well documented fact... that execution chambers frequently have the smell of death in them.
of course the smell isn't actually death.
when a human knows his or her life is about to come to an end, it will tend to reach an anxiety level... that will cause it to emit highly noxious odors.
in this particular case, we're smelling a combination of human smells... and the smells of the gas used to kill said human.
now for the fun part, boys and girls.
black king gets to sit down in the gas chair.
black king?
that would be me.
and await further instructions.
"""there you'll find some meat and a pan."
"""this is to be cooked and eaten""."
oh, man!
"""inmates were always suspicious that meat supplied..."
"""was not cow, pig or lamb,"
"""but something else."
"""something sweet and nothing like anyone had ever tasted before""."
so, we're talking human flesh, right?
you in?
yes.
guess what you get to do now?
i give up.
you get to strap toni in.
i'm paraphrasing here, but toni should fully comprehend... the fear the victims felt when they were about to be gassed.
you're good at that.
let's just say, some of my girlfriends have been on the kinky side.
is that okay with you?
okay.
"""your task is to shut off the master valve"
"""before the gas terminates your teammate""."
you need to follow the pipes.
makes sense.
taking bets?
i will bet 100 on her throwing up.
done.
it's weird.
i can't do this.
i can't.
it's my worst nightmare.
come on, sweetie, that's the show.
"""no more college debt""."
look, remember what he said?
"""if the team wins, there'll be a substantial bonus""."
do it for the team, girlfriend.
you gonna hurl?
thank you.
okay, angel, i'm at the bottom of the stairs.
shit!
do you hear me?
he's back.
this really stinks.
let me out.
hey, come on.
hey, let me out, man.
my god!
who is that man standing there?
topless.
so manly.
let me out.
i don't know, con. this guy is actually starting to creep me out.
hey, stop playing.
let me out.
so, what's up?
i need to talk with you.
outside?

where are they?
i don't know, but just give me one second.

there's that guy again, see?
wow.
who the hell is that?
okay, how'd he get there so quick?
that's the guy from the painting, right?
yeah.
yeah, it... it looks like him.
cool.
no, not cool.
he either walks through walls, or there are more than one of them.
we all seen the prestige, right?
do you mind if we pass?
please?
guys?
guys?
fake blood pack, fake shiv.
nicely done.
in fact, maybe even oscar worthy.
no.
no, that's not right.
this is way, way off script.
it looked real to me.
connie, they are playing us.
trust me.
what?
look.
they copied the picture.
what?
casting.
costume.
easy.
hold on.
no.
no.
he's a real ghost.
can't get any more off than that.
he goes any further with him, he's gonna take him off my grid.
what?
look, it's a huge prison.
i mean, i couldn't put my cameras everywhere.
show me the hole.
show me the chamber.
taylor, somebody's gotta go in there and see if they're okay.
i can tell you, they don't look okay.
she's acting, acting, acting.
where is scelzi then?
i don't know.
probably off his face somewhere.
i'm gonna call the office.
yeah, you too.
good night.
they say they've got no idea what's going on here.
still feels wrong.
okay, i'll go and prove it to you.
no problemo.
anyone coming?
yeah, i'll go.
i'll grab a camera and get some cool footage.
thank you.
you must be nice to them.
easy peasy lemon squeezy!
"""easy peasy lemon squeezy""."
hey, you know what?
you're actually kind of photogenic.
yeah, so funny, pretty boy.
i want to do my task.
kill the air-con.
come on.
connie, what do you wanna do?
hold the game.
wow, this place is kind of spooky, right?
it gets a bit weird.
where'd he go?
i don't know.
i didn't see him.
he went right past here.
dead end.
what was that?
yeah, what was that?
shit.
taylor?
put angel on screen.
we need to get those kids out of there.
can you hear me?
listen up.
there's been a slight change of plans.
we're gonna need to stop the show.
what?
why?
i'm gonna be honest with you.
there is somebody in there with you.
who?
we're not sure.
but i need you to get yourself out of there as fast as possible, understood?
you're playing me?
you're trying to freak me out.
open the door.
i want to win and i want my money.
so open the door!
who opened the door?
sorry, you're not serious, are you?
idiot.
you're task is to memorize and locate the clearly marked cell seven.
lucky!
in this cell, warden harvis received a near fatal stab wound from an inmate.
you'll find a key in that cell, and this key can release both your inmate colleagues from the hole and the gas chamber.
cool.
is that all you got for me?
easiest money i've ever made.
what am i afraid of?
nothing.
angel!
stanton?
help!
great, now she's gone off my grid.
hello?
who's there?
hello?
angel?
angel.
put me down.
who are you?
angel?
angel!

this isn't right.
put me down.
hold on.
it's you.
no!
angel, are you okay?
he killed my brother.
he's gonna kill me.
he killed my brother.
new jersey school of acting.
not bad for a straight guy, right?
connie, you there?
yeah, just about.
how in the hell did you organize all of this?
with great difficulty.
it's gonna make a great show.
i will deal with you later.
i'm gonna de-rig some of my shit first, okay?
you really are an asshole.
you said you wanted a great show, didn't you?
well, you got it.
