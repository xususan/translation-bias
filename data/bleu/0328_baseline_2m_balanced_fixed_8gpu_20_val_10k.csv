michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, he shared his bed with his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think you and i are fit together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i will.
i need to write a 000-word essay about the moral side of the war and the advancement of a conflict.
i'm not sure our ethics teacher would like me to cheat when i'm writing a test.
so, you passed my ethics test.
in fact,georgemichael was desperately burned to her teacher, the ethics teacher at bethbaerly.
small crimes can be slaughtered even the hands of people who commit little crimes.
no ring ring ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
g.d.k.'s eye was upon us.
your father thought it would make us look more charitable.
he must have imitated my signature.
'maybe a year ago,'i'll have a son... who'd finished the sinking cheese!
you have to get me out of this.
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't take care of her
and i don't have a mother's compassion and milk any
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yes-yes.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
meanwhile, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
why am i telling you this?
i guess there's some things that you can't tell your father
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set up his teacher's dad... to help him do his maternal duty.
there's nothing wrong with that.
however, i must say that i'm a little hurt that you don't think about it.
and the aunts can do this.
teachers can do that too.
sure, someday, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay's never been so proud of what she said all her life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i keep telling you about.
she's really... a young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma," you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache
yeah.
but gob mistook michael's affection for decency, and he felt like he was fighting to get involved.
because, you know, beyond adorability... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
_
and george sr. was about to come to a surprise visit.
i've read all your teachings and bought all your tapes.
and i watched it all over again.
george sr. had recently sold a series of tapes he had recently offered to people... to make money for his new spirituality.
i also lost two pounds by eating your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to find out where
this is a nice place to start.
and after michael got rid of the two girls he'd made a date with, lindsay met at the parent-teacher night.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this bedroom have the same floor plan as our kitchen?
i think he's very fit for you.
i thought this would help you get the concept of motherhood out of your head.
besides, i can't hurry up and marry someone just because my son wants to.
i'm mrs. baerly, the ethics
my goal is to make my students appreciate the importance of life... that could be the result of an unthinkingly triggered
and michael began to know his son's ethics teacher.
and that's the "rrrrrr" part of
you know, it's very annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you were laughing.
"rrrr!" - "rrrrr!" - "r
but, you know, i'm gonna
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite her to have a drink?
or... or...
yeah, he's dead
i think that mr. daniels having a stroke with...
let's go get a drink.
yeah, maybe it will help.
george sr. was dealing with his own admirer.
i've already told you many of my sins.
maybe you could tell me a few sins.
well, there are legal indicators that show my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me about one of those things that happened... again at the university dorm.
and what's his meeting with mrs. bayerly, the second date today...
michael, this little korean has come, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think that's him.
you're gonna have to peel her to freeze to say something
yes, mama.
they'll take her back.
don't take your shoes off, little man!
don't take your shoes off!
he's out of
who is it?
this "annong" is your father and i have adopted.
what, i'm leaving for a few days and you find a new son?
lucille buster realized she was worried, even jealous.
and she understood how it felt to be ignored.
annyong is your brother now, anny
cancel it.
it stays.
listen, i'll call you sonar again.
nice driving.
are you making dinner reservations?
a "little korean" did it.
and after the meetings...
michael's been a step he hasn't
well, do you think this is a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we get inside without waking everyone up?
this may not be my best idea so far.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i loved.
and i took someone you liked.
i'm like, "nashbaggerbagerlajam
listen, i know you're trying to get revenge on marta case.
i was lying to you when i said i wouldn't try to sleep with her, so...
he has to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
that's
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
seriously, i had a chance to get rid of him.
it's ok
very romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but first, i don't know it was real.
but now, your... moral teacher...
yeah, i did that for him.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, as a matter of fact, i'm sure you're interested in her.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
is this about your class?
i mean, she loved him... that he loved
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was she doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with her.
well, why would he do that?
why did he sleep with my ethics teacher?
you and i know that, but gob just...
he's not one of the good shooters that targeted his target, and he's almost everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
she's been accompanying the strange dance girls... and i thought i'd go see her and, uh, do, uh, do,
"hey, you want to dance?"
and that's what i thought was gonna happen, "what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it differently in the mirror, but...
but, you know, you know, we were dancing with a joke or something.
i didn't think so details.
don't you think you should go out with someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've taken a very difficult book to find a picture of saddam disappointment in a bathing suit.
"what would saddam do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's just like our fire escape.
in prison, george sr. was preparing for the evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon was making his own preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael is still angry with gob... and yet he went to find the family expert in making trouble.
i know you went out with shannon.
with that cheerleader?
yeah, she's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different
i wish i had someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and i asked him... but he was breathing and he dropped the phone.
i never heard back.
you know, maybe we should both go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hello.
my mother took it.
he's making me tape him to school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss george michael's condition with mrs. bearly.
i'm sorry.
hey.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality...
you see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's like, she's in love with you, so
he knows we're leaving.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most unnatural thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been an ethics teacher for half a
look, that was preemptive.
my brother was trying to sleep with you.
then i want to leave you right now and i'm not coming back to you.
i see.
from now on.
george sr. went for a walk with cindi.
george.
and she's getting to know him
you can totally spill your guts at me here.
it's weighting my soul
you, you,
she's picking up the camera
(i'm taking her to the grand dance, this is your dinner, so she's away with mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy
watch your back, my migrant little brother!
and spring dance was the last pace.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting her in because she doesn't have the perfect-shaped nose, circle-shaped eyes, the strong square jaw.
do you want to dance?
all right!
finally found shannon, gob called...
gobun found out he was cheating on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i ruined our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about this for a long time, and-and
that's... that's your right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing at a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, my ethics teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
after being so mean to you, it really made me feel compelled to try to protect me.
in fact, gob confuses michael's ethics teacher... with his civics teacher.
man, he's got... the type.
gob, miss whitehead was a citizen tutor.
second movement.
i've been seeing mrs. baerly, and i should never have brought gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never wanted to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed at some sad things, but...
i don't think we're gonna have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm getting that cake.
hey, you want to dance?
i can't believe this is working.
the next arrested development.
buster's cheque would make him angry.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
no candles allowed here.
my mom's going crazy.
no, it's okay.
i'm burning my own candle.
yeah, that's what i'm gonna do
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you with these?
it's ok
right here, i'll help you.
these?
okay, here, let me carry it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
that's what you're suggesting, connie, it'
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die
we're all going one day, right?
four months ago, each of you attended an interview to join a never-before-seen tv show.
and guess what?
you win.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm totally gay, and i'm proud of
you're sweet, aren't you
i want to rule our country.
next question.

he doesn't know
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.

these days, barack looks like obama.
each of you will earn $00,000.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
damn it!
great.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know if this is a donkey joke?
that's
actually, it's our third show, but we're not gonna publish until the fall
you're gonna have to play and earn the money to see if this is a prank or not.
you will be asked to perform a series of tasks.
the missions will force your borders, your courage and your thought.
sounds like fun, doesn't it?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i didn't have a girlfriend to admit that even with her head
i have to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
stick around.
you'll find out.
the total amount of money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if you all make it through the night, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can spend the night here for me.
does anyone else want to join her?
i'm not.
there's no way i'm going to the city with this
i'm in
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him
goodbye.
you're an idiot.
it's a damn party joke, they're gonna fuck you.
you don't look like a bunch of idiots.
don't you see this is a record party?
or we'll be famous.
there's a human head in there!
don't worry, it's not
it seemed pretty real to me.
that's why they call it special effects.
it's nice, isn
a little sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thank you to our award-winning special effects team.
follow me, fellas.
in the warm swamp water, lazy crocodiles are waiting for their prey.
the indian crocodiles are long and benign.
to such crocodiles...
guys.
i see you're working hard as usual.
are we ready?
we're all set
and absolutely.
keep it up.
yes, sir.
hey.
great job scaring them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are joining the show.
you seemed really scared.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really gives me the creeps when
did you know that?
the dead homeless?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
it must be a big coincidence.
do you really think it's safe there?
it's safe enough for the show to be insured.
any other questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're rolling.
each of you has been chosen by your own free will to spend the night in prison to earn $00,000.
it's clear enough, isn'
all right, let the party begin.
you can find everything you need in your base camp, that's the manager's office.
where is he
it's compl
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you've taken all our clothes, how can we write?
go down the hall, turn right again, left.
straight down the stairs, left, right, and one more left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
there you will find a key to get you out of your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought leaving the basement was terrible.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where is she going?
welcome to the mission.
can you not do that?
i don't see a damn thing here.
does anyone remember where we're going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, right twice, then left.
there's too many straight walks
no, go down the hall, straight down the hall,
"turn to the water, do it right again, and to the left
"then straight down the stairs, then straight down the st
"sola, right, and left again."
what are you?
smart.
_
careful.

oh, my god
what is this place?
and be ready.
it was fun.
let's speed them up a little
yes, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
damn it.
i don't
the power's running low, the generator should've come in.
damn it!

strange, isn't it?
be careful!

here we are.
we're here

i think he's the manager

okay, yeah.
look at this.
what's up, man?
"hello, brave contestants.
"welcome to warden clem harvis's office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room
"this chess stones will determine your personal role.
"you cannot change your stones with the other contestants.
"jillas were her favorite".
"now it's your turn to put your hand in the box."
oh, shit.
well, who wants first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't
what do you mean you don't know
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black fort.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
damn it!
that was really sick.
my little piggies, welcome to the task.
now let me tell you about the pennyville state prison.
in the time of crisis in 0000, when the cost was up, the ruthless warden decided to raise his fortune by destroying certain expenses.
these were their prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the director's crimes were released.
the last person here was sentenced to the death penalty was director harvis himself.
rumor has it that the manager's still walking down the halls.
tonight, you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured souls under this building.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
does anyone want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the prison church to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first hallway.
the sound job is awesome
thank you.
damn it!
what is it?
they turned off my flashlight.
i can't see anything.
okay, calm down, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung the babies!
their children... their
i think they've got it covered with speakers.
sounds are more effective than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
oh, my god
that sounds lovely.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't
there's a sound
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're calling me on speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flashlight.
all right, now?
open the bible to the marked page...
"you will find the lord's prayer there.
"00 years ago, the holy place was done with no respect for this place,
"now this is the room of unusual events."
oh, my... "in reverse."
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit
i can't do
"when you complete your mission...
"if there's no sign of the director,
you can go back to camp.
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry, whoever i'm bothering
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
"to protect us from evil...
"our father in the mountains...
"don't let evil lead us.
"to protect us from overcome...
"give us our debts, as we forgive those who owe us.
"and give us our daily bread today.
"as it is in heaven...
"as in the sky,
"for thy kingdom and dominion are yours."
please tell me i can go now.
"before you go to camp"
oh, my god, randall, you should blow out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit down there for a minute.
look what they're made for money
where'd she go?
i understand that the people who did this work cut our connection to our homo friend for a little while to give our homo friend a more scary weather.
whatever.
absolutely, she's gone in a j
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, man, it's not that bad.
it's definitely not worth the
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it
they can give you another assignment.
no kidding.
i swear you don't even know how you feel there.
it's like you're walking through a thick fog, just cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
yeah, she's right.
i want to go next.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated
we'll send scelzi downstairs and have her look, you'll fix it.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen
it's too
we need to talk.
i'm busy
we can either talk or i'll go or
it's important to me too, taylor
what do you mean?
i had a little research done.
by "do not disturb" you mean the local girl you slept with?
am i right?
big lips, wide hips, taylor.
okay, the prison isn't just for the
do the women have division?
and that damn crazy manager would go naked around the women's department and never answer anyone.
he beat them up, raped them, knocked them down, and starved them to death.
they say she's been feeding some of her own bab
what's that supposed to mean?
what do i mean?
this true story will increase interest in the show!
everyone could be talking about us.
it's nothing compared to the facts you made up.
i agree.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do that, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
is that so?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they are.
nice.
scelzi, what's that?
it's just a little something to get me through the night.
you want some?
just get your hairy ass over here, okay?
yes, captain.
hello?
you scared the shit out of me.
i've got a pretty good stuff
suit yourself.
we're all ready to begin.
i'd say my biggest fear was being buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will put you in the freedom zone".
okay,
i'm at the end of the freedom
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
damn it!
what?
blood.
it's not real
no cursing, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me you're upstairs, not down the stairs.
i'm sorry
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down there, you're gonna see a finger
he says...
damn it!
"welcome to cell number five.
"as we consider the violence and insanity,
oh, shit.
tell me what to do and i'll get out of this hell right now.
no!
thank you.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a prisoner fails to commit suicide and fails to
"you will now live the penalty for a prisoner."
okay, where's the
under your foot.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult mission.
"you'll be told what you'll do when you'
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my job.
connie.
what?
check this out.
what?
oh, no...
you're fired.
why not?
you went behind my back, and i specifically told you, you added something to the show, and you're asking why you were fired?
this is not our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't
don't look at me.
look, connie, you gotta get that guy out, okay?
he's gonna fuck
damn it!
we'll be ruined.
so you didn't bring this?
not with a cut.
it's obvious
what's so obvious?
come closer.
i asked you why you put a camera in the control room.
yeah.
the camera back... they want to record the footage...
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
it's genius, isn
it's absolutely gen
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to film how he scares us by putting something into the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black king and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you could do another mission.
well, that's
okay, black king and white horse turn right and go to the gas chamber.
white queen and black horse go straight, and they go to prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"the hawk and the left first, turn right.
"rok and go to the end of the hallway,
"and come down the stairwell".
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, open it.
we're in.
"welcome to the gathering room.
there must be a light on the wall behind you, turn it on.
"black king and white horse enter the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
that place deserved the best, it was the real place.
it's the only place the legal department has
nice, isn't
it's pretty creepy
oh, my god
what's that smell?
a documented real death chamber is often carried by death's own smell.
of course, the smell isn't really
if a man knows that his life's last moments, his concern has come to the end, it'll cause an epidemic of smell.
in that case, the smell of the human smell we're breathing is the smell of the gas that killed him.
it's time for fun, ladies and
he's sitting in the black king's
black king?
that would be me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you will find some meat and a ceiling.
"you're gonna cook this meat and eat
man!
the prisoners are always nerd, pig...
"or there is no lamb and there is no lamb...
"that they suspected.
"they thought they'd never tasted before, that it's a nice
you're talking about human flesh, aren't you
are you inside?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i gave up.
you'll connect toni.
i'm transferring you from here, before toni's gas can be accelerated, the fear of the prisoners must be fully lived
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends had some weird desires.
are you okay?
okay.
"your mission is the gas teammate...
"to find the main valve and cut the gas before it kills the
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to throw up.
okay.
strange.
i can't do
i can't
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
no more prank.
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they'll pay extra money."

yeah, what was that?
oh, shit.

listen to me.
there's been a change of plans

the bbc can confirm that the american terrorist leader adem qasim has escaped from mi0 custody, one of the most serious mistakes in the history of the
the security convoy transporting qasim seems to have been attacked on the shelolt route.
you call it not war, because it's in the west streets.
because in new york, in washington, you didn't want that in london.
but the children of pakistan didn't want them either
when they get shot with drone airplanes, they call it murder.
qasim presents a new kind of threat.
so far, he hasn't targeted civil
our models show a 00% chance of an attack within 00 hours.
the more pressure he gets, the smaller the window.
i can't say that when i'm under tape tape
the secretary of state is coming tomorrow
we serve the british people, not washington.
if that's not true, we're already done.
the americans think we don't serve the purpose anymore.
we need a head.
i'll be off duty in the morning
you didn't hear anything about qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, what's gonna happen to me
you're out.
nobody else knows that qasim is in his web.
just get out.
will holloway?
go.
how's life after mi0?
you're not from the moscow division.
you need london.
is there anyone you should say goodbye to?
thank you.
we know about harry's connection to your family, so we understand this may not be easy for you.
even if he's dead, it'
harry's too arrogant to kill himself.
he was pretending to kill himself.
he went to this woman's grave
the love of your life
harry's team has noticed a change in harry's attitude since she died.
she's emotionally distant, she's cold, she's
water would be below 0 degrees.
she had hypothermia before she reached the bank.
this is the picture before you entered the land, and this is the picture you said it was taken after you jum
before she disappeared, harry made three encrypted phone calls.
it's your old emergency message box.
why did she call you?
i have no idea.
the last time i talked to him was two years ago when he got me off the mi0
she wants to talk right now.
that makes you useful.
can you help us find him?
no, thank you.
and you, harry, do you talk a lot about berlin?
the night your father died?
if there's anything else, mace, i have a right to know.
i don't think i can decide that...
if you're not really going to kill him, i think you've told me what you wanted
find harry, so you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
i thought i'd take that title to the grave.
she's been an anti-terrorist head for her majesty's security service lately
funny, but who are you really?
someone who knows what these two words mean to you.
asma shishani.
go.
how did you find me?
what do you want?
i know it was someone on my side.
they never told me who they were.
of course not, but you must have been connected.
a phone number, that's all.
the phone number will work.
in return, i'll give you what you want.
impossible.
he said he was a human rights lawyer.
your government helped them after i put my two brothers in jail.
but after i was released, she became too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if he's a spy, he's not
and then don't worry, tell her it's not worth anything to you again.
keep her alive, she's guaranteed to keep my promise.
i don't need guarantees.
take her to a hospital now or the deal's off!
what she needs is mercy.
no!
she has a daughter.
and you sent him after me?
you put her in danger and now you refuse to save her from pain?
how the fuck are you?
don't send her parents the video.
harry... harry
you have a deal.
according to the bbc, there's no improvement on the capture of adam qasim, the terrorist.
the national threat level has reached critical level, so there's an attack on his ear.
in the economy news, the ftse 000 fell again this morning and sterling continued to breathe the bucks, euros and other currency units.
there's a new intel on harry.
he's got a lead that we've been tracking through to kent coast.
holloway, this is classified.
we also found explosive tracks there.
you've known him longer than any of us.
do you think it's possible that qasim could have got harry involved somehow?
to take her with you?
i don't
anyway, you find harry, we find qasim.
anything for holloway?
here you go.
tomorrow,'00.
salpa 0, show a, park at bay one.
then, open your eyes.
i hope you come alone.
just for protection.
if you can't get a crazy cold war purple without shooting, we're really in trouble.
i don't promise.
it says not yet.
until we see him, we play this through harry.
roger that.
doors opening.
go.
ground floor.
doors opening.
open sightings, multiple exits.
repeat, holloway.
what harry needed to set up a meeting.
yes, mr. holloway, your uncle said he'd meet you at the coffee shop.
she left her cell phone at home.
the guy in the parking lot, get rid of him
he could wear an mi0 t-shirt.
listen to me.
stop underestimating harry.
don't think he won't risk your men.
wait for the signal to send...
what is it, alpha one?
holloway?
holloway, where are you going?
wait.
no, we don't have a pattern there
don't move.
holloway, don't move!
terminal 0b.
doors closing.
he got me a flight.
pa000, the plane of glasgow.
i'm going to glasgow.
call the glasgow office.
get me the airport police.
priority code sigma nine.
the police want a clear path to the terminal.
and get us permission for heathrow security.
pa000, passengers on the flight to glasgow...
holloway, don't go to the airport.
what am i doing here, harry?
i had to find someone i could trust outside the service.
it's a short list when you leave drunk, crazy and dead.
to be honest, the only person i can call a friend is someone who thinks i ruined her life.
qasim's escape was set up by someone at the top of the service.
by one of the people who asked you to follow me.
that's why i had to disappear.
you had qasim.
he's our only connection to the rene
once he's in the system, he'll be
he's planning an attack.
someone's trying to destroy the service itself.
you're crazy.
ruth's death...
don't
look at you, that's all i want.
what are you waiting for, harry?
mi0 was my everything and you took it from me, for nothing.
hate me all you want, but i think you believe in the service.
what happened in berlin?
is that how they tricked you?
this may not end as you'd hoped.
i'm afraid i have to tell them there's something in the lining of your jack
there's nothing there, of course, but they'll have to check
i'll send you a number.
call me in 00 hours, please.
i'm security services.
put your hands behind your back!
you just let her go.
calm down, francis.
we don't want you to have a heart
the deadly one.
mi0 looks like a complete liability right now, and i'm the last friend of mi0's government.
i mean, you really need to be nice to me right
in other words, is he crazy?
that doesn't contradict her with the last three psych
she refused to attend.
he didn't stop being harry pearce.
no matter how crazy he is, i still catch him...
for example.
she asked me to help her disappear.
you didn't think of taking what you wanted and bringing her to us?
don't think we can't put your life in a shitty position just'cause your life hasn't fucked up since harry fired you.
since we've threatened each other, don't get all three of you haven't been hanging on the cliff or anything.
your entire organization seems to be disposed of right now.
find qasim.
it's full
they're ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i saw that name working on a case.
i thought they took you off duty.
they've
now, what really happened?
the kidnapping may have been set up by someone in the service
do you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i left it two weeks ago.
there must be one around here.
tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't apply
when i was 00, i was hanging out with a guy who makes money transfers.
the k section was interested in some people using it, so they got to me.
you started as an agent?
and when i was done, they asked me to train as an officer.
when i told you, my family came back to me.
and if someone you work with helped qasim escape, that would be a problem, right?
all right.
something felt wrong that day.
rob vass, my team leader, he was in the front car with me.
he told me not to open the weapons compartment.
he ordered me to chase.
where does he live?
it's
the w00 account front.
panama city.
service bribery fund.
june, what are you here...
who are you?
you told me not to chase qasim.
you told me not to chase when i acted on my gun.
we swore an oath, rob.
i'm not saying anything until i get to thames house.
we're not going to the thames house.
will, what did you find?
qasim's bodyguards have been deliberately weakened
the team leader was involved.
she's just a sho
find out who gave the order.
the americans think mi0 is a weak link, and i think someone inside is joining them.
when qasim escaped, we fell out of sight.
the cia has taken it completely.
fire... fire
he was gonna shoot
her pulse... her
he's dead,
he's
listen.
you should go home.
june!
i'll handle this, but you have to go, now.
i didn't hear a piece of this song killed.
who's that warranty shot?
landon miller.
the agency hawk.
he's trying to secure his continued support and hopes not to give the keys to the kingdom.
every time i see you, francis, you look like you've been buried one or two inches of a cow that's been spinning from langley or the pentagon.
you don't have to tell me
i think at times like this, we shouldn't forget whose flag was shaken.
francis.
i'm trying to help, but she's officially accusing me of doing a job for the cia
tonight, your generals, your politicians, your spies, met for a celebration.
tonight, we will attack the heart of their power.
our enemy is the politicians who send your sons and your daughters to die in illegal wars.
the spies who spy on you like you are guilty.
this war is beyond religious differences.
all flights out of the u.s. kingdom
she had it.
warrender lived.
if you have a way to get to qasim, tell me now.
there's another way.
qasim's wife.
asma shishani.
she's got the fsb.
if i find out where they've kept her, she gives the traitor.
you made a deal with her.
yeah.
and if we succeed, it will lead us right to him.
surrender and set it up.
how do you know the russians have her?
in exchange for a cia agent trapped in moscow.
i can reach a distance, but you need to open the secret door.
it's a ip address.
you're kidding.
it's the only way, will
harry's getting help from somewhere.
i've eliminated their former contacts, but i need access to personnel files to do it properly.
but it won't take you anywhere exciting.
i'm in position.
looks like i'm gonna have to steal a lot of extra bandwid
the drink.
malcolm?
all right, i'm in.
i'm looking at the servers now
harry, we gotta go.
can't we do this faster?
i can do it.
but unfortunately, this machine is from the previous century.
the department's already pulled these
erin watts.
it could be worth a closer look.
fill the space for me.
but i had an agent released.
i almost got him out.
i've been in business less than a year.
sooner or later they make you choose.
all right, i'll leave you alone.
it's over?
am i sure what?
i'm sorry, will.
harry.
harry!
harry, what did you do?
stay away from the computer.
i didn't feel the need to say this before, but i hope you know what you're doing.
is harry working with qasim?
he stole an entire gchq data archive.
everything we have on our western agents in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
he was seen at the schaefffield airport cctv.
i don't
harry didn't do that cyber attack on his own.
then who's helping him?
except you.
and you're still protecting her.
why not?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i'll find her.
and there's a threat.
the analysis shows that within 00 hours there's gonna be a wide scale attack, there's
an officer in charge of qasim's escape is missing.
there are signs of a struggle in his house.
do you know anything about that?
how's your mother, holloway?
i heard it's not too good.
she hasn't packed since your father died.
understandable, really.
and then the doorbell comes.
i know, i know.
harry was right about one thing.
you're not good enough.
home secretary, can we really hope that qasim will stop the attack again?
we've destroyed the threats of our freedom and way of life.
your ability to hurt us may be important, but it's the end.
you'll find our decision has no limits.
they're not listening.
they never killed our women?
we're making the world a better place, brother.
transfer team at city airport.
we have a warrant atc to cover the road to the convict's vehicle whenever
i think i owe you one.
you were absolutely right about vass.
danke.
alexanderplatz.
northeast corner by the metron, 00th.
we have a safe house.
call it nostalgia.
don't forget to bring the archive
don't forget to bring his wife
how did you find me?
there's only one place in berlin to negotiate.
you told me.
northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
no emotionality.
that's the price of qasim's wife.
when she comes out of fsb custody, qasim will give me a number.
and he's taking me to the traitor
they're gonna destroy the service where it's vulnerable to take it.
get in the car, harry.
there's an old hotel 00 minutes away.
my contact can meet us there with a clean passport.
you're going home.
i'm sorry about that.
why are you here, mrs. keaton?
keep walking, harry.
i killed someone because of you.
you're c0, aren't
what are you doing, harry?
talent spotting.
and which one of you found it?
for god's sake, will
preparation is everything.
what about vass?
when you came to my house, i reported
i said someone was asking about qasim's escape.
they tied me to the command center and told me what to do.
they went to vass's house ahead of us and planted the evidence.
i've arranged for vass to escape.
you think i want to do it?
i know my duty.
i'm the only one here who
you were set up.
he's right, will.
but i wonder if miss keaton is sure about me.
it was a secure command chain.
what was i supposed to do?
do you believe him?
yeah.
i'm sure your men will come and find you, if your usefulness is still viable.
after all this is over, what do you think they're gonna do to
i did what they asked me to do.
we're changing the deal.
we're taking qasim's wife to london.
tell him you can't see his wife again.
let's go get her.
what happened to alexanderplatz?
a sudden agoraphobia sensation.
i'm afraid there was a problem with qasim's wife
at least be good enough to put it in my car.
harry.
colonel.
i hate to be modest, but we're gonna need your clothes.
as the search for adam qasim intensifies, everyone traveling on the national rail line of the united kingdom has to show valid identification and control of the suitcase.
i have your wife.
let me talk to her.
the russians put him to sleep and...
bullshit.
i'm bringing her to london.
no.
i'll tell your whore you said goodbye.
is the baby too much?
no, it's just you.
i trusted june.
you were right to take me off duty.
despite everything i've done, you're still doing something good here.
i won't let their sacrifice be in vain.
this was it.
was it fast?
she could have left me, but she chose not to leave me
if you try anything, anything, i can't guarantee anyone's safety.
nobody's
you bring my wife, i'll give you your number.
here we go.
hello?
holloway.
this message came from h branch.
me.
we can catch qasim, but we need help.
and let's go.
one clean choice, hannah.
trust me, and help me.
or go.
do it well or well, right?
damn it.
they're getting closer to the position
the self-developing algorithm i wrote last night is constantly updating, reviewing all potential views.
he's not cutting off the sudoku, then
please.
all right, we're here.
how much time do we have?
i'm looking at 000 cameras.
give me something.
the minute he realizes we're playing him, he
wait.
he was working 00 seconds ago.
are you sure?
yes, it's been confirmed.
the camera is down at the last minute.
third floor roof, east corner.
harry, we have to stall.
i hope you're looking right at us.
yes?
the south has called you.
i have his wife.
you were supposed to look south.
give me the number.
give me the number or we'll go.
turn around now or you're dead.
here.
so is he.
i haven't got him yet.
you have two seconds to turn around.
turn around.
maybe this guy's never seen her.
i'm almost there
him?
kill him.
give me the number.
don't
stop!
no!
okay?
will, she's fine.
the shooter's dead.
then it's over.
malcolm, feather.
yes?
my wife is dead, isn't
harry, listen.
let hannah report us.
harry?
hannah, why did harry take the headphones
i don't
let us know.
get sco00 here, now.
three loaded trucks loaded with rdx leaving limehouse north industrial park in the next 00 minutes.
how do you know?
qasim just told me.
truck loaded with bombs leaving in 00 minutes.
i think we got him.
let's go!
armed police!
stay where you are!
clear!
clear!
who saw the primary target?
negative!
negative!
negative, sir.
command, area clear.
harry.
he sold his own men.
why would he do that?
what did you do?
armed police!
don't move!
move!
you have to tell them everything, harry.
i think we have a lot to talk about.
this might be a little out of line.
since the southwest corner of alexanderplatz.
keep an eye on holloway.
make sure he's safe.
maybe we won't be so hasty.
did you find qasim?
harry will talk.
you still don't know him.
qasim gave up his entire operation.
what did you say to him?
i should have thought they'd set you free after berlin.
they want to offer you a deal.
put everything on harry and go.
i told them i'd quit after i did this.
there's no way
i can't
there's an emergency backup key around her neck.
whatever you're up to... wh
what would ruth think?
what did you give her?
check the back.
southwest corner.
i found harry on the northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
the opposite.
where you're gonna trap somebody.
harry?
i gave her you.
get down!
get down!
get down!
lock us down.
get down!
get down!
we're not here for you!
we came for them.
get down!
think about your families.
hamza.
why not?
there are 00 men on the other side of these gates.
you must surrender.
come here.
open it!
if you think we're gonna negotiate...
open the door.
but he'll kill us.
there are too many demons in one room.
the only way to get out of here alive is to
you think i want to get out?
how many people's lives began to end in this room
my people's lives.
your people?
i didn't ask you to speak for them, to kill for them.
if you want a hostage hostage...
i think he's made it clear he's not interested
i'm the director general of mi0.
kill me and put the gun down.
otherwise, you're nothing but a dead terrorist.
no one will see you as a hero.
when we're done, you're gonna be a drunken, wife-beating, powerless heathen.
we'll send a few marrakech male hookers forward and give them free tickets to disneyland for telling them you begged them to piss on you.
we can't remember you very well, can we, adam?
wait, wait, wait.
i pulled the helicopter back.
but... but
you fucking coward.
i thought you were fighting a higher standard.
i'm sorry about your wife's death, adam
i know what this can do to you.
is this supposed to stop me?
it's
stop!
why did you bring her here?
i made a choice.
without plan b.
why do you think i'm keeping you out of that room?
people are still dead, harry.
it's a lot less of what's gonna die in
how can you make such a choice?
it's my job.
aunt, can you come outside and play?
hello, geraldine.
finally, it comes down to who's got the longest lie.
right?
if we had kept that morning, qasim would never have escaped.
you gave the met's air unit an order to reverse all mi0 requests, didn't you?
that's the advantage of being a lonely maniac.
i don't have to prove it
sacrificing his own fortune so he could be questioned by a foreign power.
the americans would have made you director general, of course.
how many more lives was that promotion worth?
what did you think you did, harry?
the service is dying
but if i'd given up the moment i realized i was on the loser side, my career would be
blow my brains out, find my 00-year-old nephew...
i think this came from you.
what is it?
the thin bowel is penetrating more than six hours or causing unstoppable hemorrhaging.
no sign.
how clever.
i was afraid that would be your answer.
that's why i took the chance to choose.
it's not lunch that makes you sick.
i ate beef ribs.
tell me you're lying, harry.
please.
tell me you didn't betray your country.
it's been four hours, geraldine.
you can spend the last three hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd play with your pretty niece.
i'm thinking.
your message said you'd tell me something.
they're spying on ruth's grave.
you can't go anymore
i have something that you should be.
your father was wearing this the night he died.
stasi pulled out everything that would work and found a way to get into the fsb archive somewhere.
she was wearing a wedding ring on the night of her operation?
i didn't kick you out because you weren't good enough
after your father, i couldn't...
i should have protected you.
good ones don't last forever, will.
then who does?
they're like me
it would really help if you knew your problem and told the men at the door.
there's room for every guest at the hotel junior high.
gather round at once.
these new problems kill in the dark.
these people will be grateful when it's dark.
i think we should keep them here to keep them safe, but i'm worried things are getting worse.
they have no idea who caused the dark trouble.
and what we need to worry about isn't what's hiding
we still haven't figured out how to lift that fog wall
maybe it's a blessing.
this was the latest from in-flight safety.
i'm on your side and i might need a new job.
i've got it under control, but if i can get another pillow for my beauty sleep, it's gonna be
try to make things right.
we talked about this.
it's almost impossible to destroy the problem without killing him.
of course, i just need information that's impossible to get the tools that i don't have and that may not exist.
i'm gonna need a team
do you have any idea what's going on?
but there's a bad element.
it's the only way to protect the rest of us
it's too risky to drive because of the magnet problem
an engineer to help fix the power plant.
he volunteered as soon as he found out.
if things don't work out, you can use her problem for the operator.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
no trace killer is out there somewhere.
and i think he really wants to prove that he wants to help you.
all right, whatever the reason, just keep an eye on her for me, okay?
because neither of us is immune to new problems.
i'm not just saying that it's
when you're gone, i'll call the person who caused the dark trouble at school.
he stole those batteries and put us in danger.
there was no other choice, dwight.
this is the third time in two weeks.
now the serial killer is in this building.
all right, i'm gonna go talk to dwight.
my father always said you were a good man.
mara's father?
there may be a way, but if you want me to explain it, it may seem more frightening, so
even on the map, maine, i can't find haven.
are you telling me you can't find a town with 00,000 people?
that's not cause problems.
then why didn't we use aether in the first place to end the troubles?
i can't bring them with seals.
so how do we find it?
gloria brought a box of stuff that duke left in gull.
i don't think william has the amount i need, and, uh, aather is just the first stage.
you told his wife you'd find him.
it's easy to make decisions from the sidelines, but sometimes
i have a town to protect.
no wonder the plant worked at 00%.
guys, i'll try, but just remember, i've never done anything like this before.
they parked here so i could talk to you, but i don't even have enough money to pay for the oil change.
if all goes well, i'll be back with aether before the sun goes down.
this is peggy's husband, rolf.
there's enough panic and fear.
the same killer that killed my son 00 years ago?
we call him "the murderer who won't leave a mark."
what else are you hiding from me, vince?
dwight's doing everything he can to make the rules accept, but he's not someone to kill people.
in this haven, exile is the same as executing.
thanks to our friend there, we're holding them in some kind of prison.
he says the generator works at 00%.
damn it, when the generator overloaded it must have unloaded energy reserves.
that explains why the power's in town.
at this rate, about five minutes.
it's almost over, and it's the only thing that protects us from dying
here, i've rearranged the generator settings to get the power to the town faster, but there's nothing else we can do.
they'd better get back.
help each other.
put the lamps around you.
share your supplies.
you see, i'm happy here.
i got your message.
get in the car now.
come on, jump!
if the war lies ahead, we should be thankful, even slean.
i don't think there's anything worse than being in love.
i don't like it here.
every story has two sides.
whoever's behind this is a traitor.
let's go.
he asked me to represent him at slean's wedding.
the palace, you are my brother's love.
that's why you're my brother.
you've seen bigger places in the iraqi realms.
none of them were ruled by a woman.
you must choose a second person to escort you and watch your interests during the ritual.
then you will hear the ties of your friends and relatives.
i don't have any rel
my mother and the others will accompany you.
kela, this is the palace of bregan.
rheda, does it always have to be a bodyguard for me
i don't really get it.
but i know i have to marry slean.
i'll love her.
this marriage can't happen
abrecan trusts you.
what do you do?
carpenters.
they can use you on the wall, then.
who are you?
a friend of the council president.
like i said, i have work to attend to.
we need to figure out how to handle it.
varr said i couldn't accept gifts.
then it's between us.
every bride should smell nice when it's
remember, it's our secret.
sit down.
we'll take what we're gonna get when they look at the
you wanted to talk?
all right.
kela, it's time for the ritual.
elvina, are you gonna be the second person i've got
for the game.
we need to talk sometime.
we need to discuss the reasons why marriage shouldn't work.
if we don't fulfil our duties, their marriage can be
beowulf!
let's celebrate.
according to ancient customs!
the dress absorbs the smell.
i'm so sorry.
it was just a little mistake.
that's all
we're gonna help slean give the symbol to his bride.
that sounds easy.
breca!
open the door!
come on, you stinking mudborn.
come on!
come on!
give me your arm.
come on!
slean.
be quiet, it's bald.
are they ready for this marriage?
i don't understand why slean wouldn't want to marry kela.
i don't think so.
she has to put her feelings aside and do what's best for everyone.
would you put aside what you wanted for others?
that's what we all have to do.
if someone spends their whole life pleasing others, then that person doesn't actually live.
thinking like that must make you feel very free.
try it.
tell every rock the truth.
but then you can look at each other and light the fire that symbolizes your marriage.
then you'll be husband and wife.
have you ever loved someone before?
no.
before you came here... you were... you
do you want to be thane?
tell my uncle i'm done with him.
go.
come on!
go!
you let her go.
we're not done here.
don't you understand?
i betrayed my mother and set up a plot with my uncle.
this woman was sent here to kill you!
i don't
is that so?
i killed my brother.
she's the one she was supposed to be
even if the world was gone, mara had everything.
people loved him because he was kind.
my father loved her as his first child.
she and rowan were lovers.
then i had the chance to escape.
i wouldn't need anything.
she was dead without fever.
he was getting better.
i poisoned her.
slean, i won't tell anyone what you did here today and what happened.
or stay.
i know, but he's beowulf's.
she went to bed the other night.
but we can choose who we can draw our fate with.
light the fire with me.
you want to be thane?
i can help you.
against what you see.
they can't take it from you, rheda.
with this marriage, you are the jarl of the shieldlands.
these rules of jarl should be held by every tribe.
if the blood money isn't paid, a killer's life will
thieves will be branded and expelled from society.
all the merchandise for trading at the shieldlands will be set by jarl.
what right does he have to decide the price of fish?
we're the ones risking their life to catch the pandiri every summer.
you should have told me about the rules.
you were where your people needed you the most, on guard duty.
i couldn't distract you
it was messy enough.
you're late for the pandiri
some think he's missing her again.
but if you fail, bregan will be in misery and he'll starve the winter.
breca's wanted for murder, you know that.
kill him!
kill breca now!
i got it!
if you do it without any explanation, we're all dead
he hired us to bring breca to the law after he escaped the gallows.
we were gonna ask the guy who helped him escape the first time?
that's why we're gonna welcome
but we have to keep breca.
herot could be at our gates as we speak!
when did we kill young women?
what do you mean?
you've been hiding in the shadows too long, abre
don't forget who you're talking
talk.
he wants breca's life or blood money for the murder of his brother.
i didn't mean to kill anyone.
hurry up!
thank you.
breca made my mother fall in love with herself
he's looking for the dirt he thinks he's got money, then he steals the money and runs, this motherf
she left my mother and took all her precious things with her.
my brother came after you.
but it cost his life.
breca, is that true?
i'll pay for your brother's blood money.
lila, do you have 00 silver coins?
i don't want money, i want blood
silence!
if the blood money is paid, breca will be released.
you lied to me.
pandiri.
pandiri!
put him through.
get ready, they're coming.
i saw it.
get out!
the council has gathered
harken wants to take my place because i missed the pandiri.
you let me down, she married slean keela, rheda jarl!
you don't understand
tell the council that our enemies are gathering, that your sister cannot rule, that she wants to save the shieldlands.
so tell me you're distracted.
say it.
i'm sorry
i knew breca had killed someone, but the story she told me was different.
it's only her fault.
lila, nobody thinks bad things about you...
that's all i have.
did you bring it?
there aren't 00 silver
not enough.
and i'm gonna hold breca while i see her work.
was there enough money?
lila?
turn it off, beowulf, please.
you won't talk to lila.
get on your horse, leave heroot and never come back.
there's no more room for you here
if herot's attacked, i want to fight properly.
if herot's attacked, i'll protect you.
let's try it
it's not about mudborn.
i don't want to talk about him
i want to know why you lied about training me.
it's wasted when you use it.
you don't even want to be a huskar
is that so?
i didn't know we were training the blacksmiths!
go.
now!
he's fighting girls now?
the view was more like the blacksmith was training huskarl.
i know you think i let you down.
that i can't focus on my duties in bregan.
but i have my reasons.
you're talking about betraying your own blood.
the center of this land needs a warrior!
someone who will take your people out of the darkness
a man in power to take control!
you're talking about betraying your sister to hide the fact that you can't afford the needs of your people.
what's the point of having fish if we're all to be slaughtered?
i'm here to vote no confidence in our thane.
those who oppose abrecan as thane.
it's been
a new thane will be appointed and announced in the morning.
get up.
next.
nobody.
don't think it's a
we're lazy, we're distract
this is gonna work out here.
from now on, we're gonna work like my dad hrothgar.
i didn't mean to interrupt
you're a good teacher.
a great thane wants a strong army behind him.
we don't have to share the same bed, but if we don't share the same room, people will
i've always liked watching herot from here.
it looks so invincible.
if i tell my mother the truth, i'll lose her trust.
and the chance to rule one day.
what if abrecan attacks?
herot could fall.
aren't you going to advise me?
i trust you.
your decision will be correct.
and i'll be there when i make it
you'll be thane.
you just have to believe it.
pandiri.
pandiri!
that's the pandir
sound the horn!
i command you, steal the horn!
abrecan, give it up.
if we don't act now, we'll be able to
why... why
you help me with the net.
help me with the net now.
why don't you help?
pandiri!
come on, hurry up!
go find me a sack.
people shouldn't leave their precious stuff lying around.
you owe my mother an apology.
but i'm a warrior and honour is at stake.
so i'll take your life.
go back to mommy, little girl.
greetings.
i didn't need your help.
because he didn't have enough money to save you.
be thankful you didn't kill him, vishka
if we don't plant the nets, our prey will be
no, he won't.
get ready.
abrecan, no!
hold the rope steady!
hurry up, they'll eat you raw!
pandiri, pandiri!
pandiri, pandiri!
hold on tight!
now stretch!
take a look.
there will be songs about this hunt.
a hunt you won.
i have a dream about us.
the biggest tribe in shieldlands!
we're not gonna follow the laws that a jarl couldn't even keep a sword
who's with me?
abrecan, abrecan, abrecan!
i need to warn beowulf.
bregan!
elvina!
the warriors are coming together.
they intend to destroy us this time.
beowulf!
if we look around us today, we'll see that more danger and harm come from religious beliefs.
my wife, stand-up shows that if i talked about soviet communism or the violence of stalin, she'd be less embarrassed.
it's the kind of interrogation that irritates things that make trouble for people, especially the philosophy.
to present a situation perfectly true within herself, it can cause serious damage, damage.
when the prophecy doesn't come true, we make fun of those people and the whole world laughs with us.
i had a friendly disagreement with richard dawkins for this problem.
maybe richard and i should be more aggressive.
especially america is surrounded by christian faith.
they're sure the world is what their religion says it is.
we'll get rid of the bad gu
i'd like to write a book like this, if i could.
but, of course, one of my fears, what happens next.
what kind of chaos?
how right is it to do that to people who think that we're doing what's religion, and the good in us?
religion is like a moral viagra for many people.
if that's true, if religion leads to the moral life of the people, anyone will take it seriously and turn the life of us into the lower business.
because there's a lot of people down there, and we can create a chaos from the fear of these people.
a lot of people want their lives to mean something, and where does that come from?
but there must be something better than religion.
yeah, there's definitely hope.
let's see what happens.
of course.
at least you didn't get piercing.
i don't know how to explain this to amy.
i'm the dumbest man in
all right, stop it.
i'm the dumbest man in
all right, you win this.
i can't find emma's papers.
honey, just so you know, even if you find the original receipt, you can't return the baby.
i need to find the paper that angela signed when she left emma on my doorstep and gave me her only deputy.
i'm finally gonna get the health insurance that i'm responsible for looking at myself
i haven't talked to her since the night we did emma.
calm down.
you gave me all the important papers on the baby to be safe.
do you have all the papers?
her father's little girl is his father'
it could be something with balloons.
it's beautiful!
did you rob a clown?
it's your birthday!
first, my birthday is tomorrow.
you used to party all the time when you
celebrating my birthday after...
"happy birthday, miley."
you know those papers i kept for me.
how irresponsible do you think i am?
but i'm
i may have mailed them in time, but she didn't get mailed, and ben may not be the only owner of emma.
we were all excited about the new baby, and i didn't have a stamp!
look, if we have angela sign this document again, we'll be fine.
because you're ben's best friend and you're the only one who's seen the girl
i like it very much, all right.
all right, emma's finally asleep
hey, danny, what's wrong with riley not wanting to celebrate her birthday?
why does she really hate it so much?
ben, riley didn't celebrate her birthday after her disastrous birthday party.
are you sure you want to watch this?
i think i'd remember if it was a disaster.
all right, come on, everybody.
danny, where are we going?
luckily for the future, you've got a real mustache and lost weight for one.
is ben here?
benjamin wheeler, come here and celebrate riley's birthday.
well, i can tell you this is my best birthday ever.
tell me you didn't do anything to the cake.
in fact, try to save it with the perm first and then cut it out
is riley still in love with ben or is that something that happened when she was a kid?
unless you're still in love with riley.
i ruined her "happy 00" birthday party.
she's not in her birthdays, but she sure loves you the rest
if ben's so irresponsible and so afraid to lose the papers, maybe he doesn't deserve to take emma's deputy alone.
if it makes you feel any better, we do most of the work.
i can imagine how hard it is to leave emma.
i knew how pretty, funny or wonderful you'd end up hurting her!
in your presence on the streets of the city, the elite tank of the american military, in just three minutes, the slade trooper 00.
also known as madox-00 as the weapon we understand as a limited range of combat capabilities.
what's more, a uh-00 has more damage power than blackhawk.
it's all about anti-terrorist and anti-gerilla operations.
miss kusumoto is also the architect of the software that is preparing for "tankbuster."
in order to demonstrate the enmity of the madox's abilities with the lamp, he personally went to the pilot's cabin
unit 0 will go to ichigaya tonight.
we're in a hurry, so be quick as we can.
oh, what the...
miss kusumoto today, you've made me quite humiliated
i'm not here to congratulate
there's only one thing i'll tell you:
wow!
kouji...
what's this?
onose, you leave this to me!
they just threw away their garbage.
i'm telling you, don't worry
i'll buy you dinner in return, won't i?
the transport vehicle from the sdf...
according to the report reports, it was only natural that this case was
it's obviously a terrorist thing
you're too alien to operations with the east-blind.
i hope you know what you're saying!
i hope you see that the burden of the accident is entirely yours.
either way, the situation we're in is critical.
we were transporting him for a field test!
it's terrib
i have to be in charge of the operation.
besides, madox-00 is currently being repaired.
while investigating the scene, the cars around the scene are giving us trouble.
shouldn't we have the police backup on the phone?
we must prepare ourselves for the worst, and keep the assistants ready.
i'm the only one who can stand in front of the madox and keep head.
although lt. kilgore is one of the "enestials," he's our best tanker in the army.
is this okay?
nobody's in the apartment, huh
anyway, i'm a little relieved.
shiori really was a pretty girl...
when he goes to study england, all the boys in japan will be grieved.
where did you learn that?
he called me in the morning and asked me to give you a message.
use the open remote to open them.
it's burning!
the pilot was able to adjust the cabin.
it feels like he's wearing a boat to ski.
we've got the madox's activation signal.
this is a disaster.
could you warm it up in the microwave?
i really fucked myself up!
shiori, what do you want?
defense?
you're on a mission with the prototype airborne tank.
don't you dare turn tokyo to vietnam!
tokyo or vietnam, all battlefields are the same to me.
you'll be a disaster.
oh, don't be alarmed.
i'm gonna get through this before i get too hot.
lieutenant kilgore is using the most advanced tank and anti-tank helicopters and his promise to take the madox off duty as a "buy."
in that case, there's gonna be a big pan
under the circumstances, there must be someone who can stop kilgore and madox.
what can we do?
we don't know the madox's target yet.
if i manage to find her before lieutenant kilgore, then maybe we'll have a chance.
but the madox situation...
i'm using unit #0, she's successfully out of power tests.
what are the chances of success
hey, you heard me!
wait for me.
that's it!
how you doing!
what are you doing on the road?
i can't wait by the side of the side of the road like
you're a real driver, man!
i've still got a lot to finish their installments

she's moving on her own
one of the apaches was shot down.
all units are authorized to destroy the madox.
just as kilgore wanted.
he's heading for the skyscrapers with the apaches in
he must evacuate the civilians immediately!
they're all over me!
i gotta go that way and use the west exit.
there's been another crazy armored rag standing!
all right, back to work, madox!
i hear you.
and i say, "you're a pain in the head."
if anyone's causing a disturbance, it's you.
"just" what?
it's none of your business.
i can't do anything i don't know what

he'll come after you to destroy him.
i know how to walk the longest and use my hands.
you have to make it.
either the madox is destroyed, or you're kilgore!
they hurt my legs.
i can't move anymore
you think i can beat him?
you were good when we were fighting.
have you read the entire manual?
hey, madox.
son of a bitch
come kill me!
wouldn't you stand up a little bit more and increase my enthusiasm?
l-l-l-l
what, you turned like a turtle!
if you can't do that much, you're gonna stain for tankbuster!
your numbers won't work on me!
kouji!
i'm coming
you're brave!
i'm tired of the cat-fouse game!

00 cops with a dog came out of nowhere.
that's the smartest thing you've ever done in your stupid life!
what are you gonna do with this baby?
you gonna give it to the cops
am i supposed to change my mind and go back?
i'll look like a pedophile

a woman is leaving her own child on the train!
as you can see, she doesn't want him
i'm gonna change your panties now!
let me look after the gun for you, okay?
will you help me find her mother?
i have more important things to do than deal with this bullshit.
you give me the gun, i'll hide it somewhere, okay?

we'll figure this out.
well, i was talking to vince...
this is a kid brother whose mother doesn't want.
what are you doing, brother?
what's your problem, man?
why are you acting like a bitch?
who are you, my brother, jeremy kyle or something?
you can't sell someone's baby to someone else
especially vince and carol.
the other day, we were selling crackheads to this guy!
no, you didn't, because she doesn't want to be found,
they'll give this boy to another vince and carol.
let go of me, brother.
i said i'd handle it, man.
what am i supposed to tell people?
yeah, yeah, she's
a little, but don't tell anyone we're here!
just take half, give me the rest.
i can't believe you sold a baby!
you didn't want it before, did you?
if i'm gonna go through all this stress, i'm gonna lose the money, and i'm gonna lose everything, so you're gonna have to talk to someone properly, okay?
she's a n
i'm like, "fuck you," or something.
what's going on in there?
you're selling drugs at the bar, right?
either you or your stupid brother took my gun and i need that gun.
you've got two hours to get my gun back, or i'm gonna tear people apart.
i'm leaving.
he's always messing things up, isn
why are you bringing this bitch into my place when my wife's upstairs?
what's going on?
he had problems with a tough russian mafia that was all over him.
she thought they were gonna kill the baby.
that's why she left the baby on the train
now, take this money and i'll give it to you when i meet ed the rest of it.
it's not a fake, vince, and you know it!
you can't tell when you don't have a cock in your mouth
it's not a problem when you fuck me in my mouth
no, she said your cock was in her mouth.
i'm not giving them the baby!
they can't either!
just relax, okay?
now get up and get that baby!
over here!
it's a gun
just know she died to give you this.
they may not let you go because you don't have a family
do you have any suggestions, which flowers would like?
white roses are good, aren't they
fuck you then!
fuck you!
are you the owner of this vehicle?
but you stopped me for nothing.
but before we do, the new owner of our glasses, the chester.
to chester.
i hope he will tremble on these wonderful monsters as i have done for years.
cheers.
i promise you, i will raise the standards of this show and you will be proud.
have a nice trip where dreams come true.
oh, thank god.
even if that sour-faced german is gone, we're gonna have domination
marjorie, it's a shame...
thank you, chester.
now, if you'll excuse me, the original family, the monsters and the curious community of monsters and their last moments
goodbye.
there's someone else to thank.
mr. richard spencer.
our lives have changed its course.
cheers.
mm!
but we're gonna have a nice feast tonight, and then we're gonna watch a movie from my own collection.
not the sign of the cross again.
no.
we're gonna watch freaks tonight.
you know this movie, richard?
i don't know.
it's a great movie.
tell me the subject, eve, paul.
ah.
cleopatra is a normally creation trapeze artist, married to a dwarf who makes little shows.
but his real purpose is to poison him and to inherit his legacy.
he plays all the freaks on his finger until one day he gets drunk and takes his true intentions.
then all freaks become enemies to him.
one night they get their revenge with knives and guns.
eve, eve.
honey, don't just say the end and miss your taste.
that sounds great!
there's a lot to do before we go west.
i can't
shut up and sit down.
you deserve it.
what happened to you?
come on, richard, open it.
i've thought about you a long time doing this.
oh, thank god.
when we saw our exhibit, we had a bunch of stunning customers, but... there wasn't anybody
are you all right, ma'am?
where are those security guards?
good to know.
now it's your turn.
oh, my god.
i don't even know that.
i've already told them everything...
stanley.
elsa...
come on... come on
talk to them.
hollywood!
i'm afraid they're all like you
it's just
come on, translate it.
aah!
oh, my god
no.
please.
my cousin works at the garden of allah.
but you brought death here... and you have to pay for it.
put that down.
come on, come on.
elsa, come on... we need to talk privately.
i believe we'll find something in common.
do you think you can run now?
i'm telling the truth.
he killed her.
she's not who you think she is.
and start running.
run!
run!
run!
just because you grew up without a father doesn't mean you should romanticize him now that he's dead.
how did he die
who killed him?
we all did it.
he broke the rule.
now.
come on.
he was my father!
he killed a freak!
the most fragile of us.
do you believe her word?
this phony bitch?
i saw dear ma petite in a jar with my own eyes.
i heard him sign it with my own ears.
as for maggie, if she hadn't helped, we'd have more bodies.
i won't forgive him.
all i want is to rot in hell.
in this case, you're gonna be friends with who
maggie's gonna change her bandages.
no way!
keep the dirty ones.
now that your mother's not here, it's up to me to protect you and
i've seen you become a man from childhood and a man to a leader-- and we need you.
i don't have hands!
i can't even pee on my own.
i've reached an old friend of mine.
he'll come and help you.
he's a real artist.
but first the wounds need to heal.
maggie will help you.
let her.
i'm so sorry.
i hate hurting you.
really?
i thought it was your only talent- to hurt people.
i love you, jimmy.
this part is real.
i always have.
i want to make a fresh start.
we can still go to new york as planned.
why not?
you're kidding, right?
you think we're just gonna go sailing into the new horizon after all you've done?
my hands are in a fucking jar, and you're responsible for all this.
i'm so sorry.
can you get ma petite back from the dead?
huh?
i've changed, jimmy.
ah!
i knew you were a fool, let's add blind to your list, shall we?
get me someone to focus on the lamp!
i can't leave this place.
i gotta get the right light for the first time, you know?
try again now!
scheisse!
elsa.
of course.
he's watching us.
can't we lift it?
just this once?
please?
okay.
yeah.
mm.
oh.
thank you, chester.
you put me down.
like an old sock.
i'm sorry, marjorie.
i got a little... carried away, but i'm happy now.
they have my magic show, you're there.
maybe i should go.
we can manage, marjorie.
the twins have accepted you.
they just don't want you to watch them do it.
they're using you, chester.
you're their boss now.
no, they don't.
they love me.
you're a murderer.
no, no.
no.
marjorie.
i know you don't like to talk about it, so don't bring it up, but you killed them.
and alice and lucy.
impossible.
i'm just a puppet.
hmm.
love destroys you, chester.
you're losing control.
i know...
i'm a monster.
you don't need them.
i'm in.
i know.
please don't leave me, marjorie.
twins?
they have to go.
i know.
they will.
ethel looks great here with her choir girls.
oh, this is from her barnum days.
she was a unique woman.
to ethel.
to ethel.
so what do you say?
didn't anyone hear what spencer said last night?
now everything's in place.
elsa killed ethel.
forest.
car crash.
it was all a scam.
i believe that.
that crazy, vindictive woman threw a knife at my paul
all elsa cares about is elsa.
i couldn't sit in my head in the first place.
i know ethel.
he wasn't someone to kill
he's not a
she wouldn't do that to her own child, and neither would we.
and leave a decent note.
if someone comes after one of us, we know what to do.
there's only one security for our future.
it's not elsa living.
have you ever dreamt you'd feel that way, dot?
thank god you told me about marjorie.
all he had to do was push him away.
i think we definitely put a good impression on it.
good evening, girls.
what are you doing here?
i'm here to extend friendly xindi.
i've been getting some information... on your last situation.
we don't want to hear anything from you.
leave nicely.
oh, dot, i can't blame you.
i acted terrible the other day.
but recent events have softened my tough side.
i lost my mother.
it was sudden and... terrible.
she's upset, dandy.
it's terrible for everyone to lose a mother.
it was.
it is.
and it made me feel like i shouldn't let go of my loved ones.
but i think you should know that we're seeing a man.
i actually got your news.
you have no idea how great it is to marry you.
if i had a chance to hold everything alone, believe me...
i came with friendly feelings.
i know i lost my chance.
i'm not half the man you deserve.
but i asked myself.
"dandy, what do you have to do to support the girls you love so much?"
then i thought i could protect you, and that's why i hired a decent man to gather information about your new friend.
it broke my heart'cause your chester creb is a fucking maniac!
we don't need to look at these.
what's wrong with you?
you're a pain in the ass, and we don't trust you like our sin.
ta-ta then.
i did my best.
my mother always used to say don't argue with a woman when she
who is it?
son.
here.
drink.
what's that?
penicillin.
i'd hate to see you die of an infection when i say we complete you.
who are you?
my name is massimo dolcefino.
i came to make you your new hands.
okay?
massimo is an old friend of mine from before the war.
he's master of his art.
no, keep it.
i've seen soldiers with a hand grenade exploded in their
they're wearing these cool hooks.
i can't pull at 00, but at least i can keep my cigarettes on my own.
and i don't have to be afraid of wooden bits for the rest of my life
massimo offers you something more classy than rusty hooks.
more convincing.
look.
see?
so is the other one
massimo saved my life.
your mother would have died of booze, and you would have been hungry on the street.
i could have married her if you weren't so stupid
"my only sin..."
sí.
"to love you..."
very, very much
no!
they were members of an organization.
and the leaders were a doctor you knew.
now get to the other one, don't rush this time.
for two years, two years,
massimo took care of me.
he taught me to walk.
and dancing.
then hindenburg fell.
nuremberg, rhineland...
we had to escape while we still could.
we had a plan.
how could i look into my love's eyes when i knew those monsters were free?
they had to pay.
i hunted them down one by one.
aah!
finally, i've reached the leader.
oh, the monster's head.
dr. hans grouper.
it shouldn't have been a painless
obviously, my death wouldn't be painless either.
it took me so personally to want to kill him
very personal.
she tortured me.
she locked me in a cell and tortured me again, and again.
how did you survive?
i lived in austria till the end of the war.
then i came to america-- in'00.
and i called miss mars for years.
but i didn't get the answer.
if you loved her so much, and you knew where she was, why didn't you come to your feet?
my body survived torture, but...
i was like a pinocchio.
there was nothing left in me for humanity.
but, uh...
sweet irony.
sweet irony.
i know you've been going through a lot of times, and it might be hard to make changes for a sit-down
and i repeat-- this has nothing to do with ego.
for this continuity...
she looks so normal.
i don't think we can judge him if we don't have definitive proof.
what about the file?
it says he killed his wife.
you're letting dandy's lies cloud your judgment.
dot and i have something to say.
we don't want to be your assistant any
why not?
we just don't want to.
maybe when you hear my final, you'll change your mind
two bodies, two heads.
it'll make a lot of
a first in the history of magic.
come on, girls, let's rehearse
we're not going in that box.
no, chester... we're not going in that box.
now if you'll excuse me
i'll go.
you... you
i could be your assistant.
it is.
get in the box, lucy.
my name is maggie
oop!
is that your magic act?
it seems a little pathetic.
shut up.
i didn't say anything.
what are you looking at?
backstage.
originally called the magic saw.
tonight you will see a very dangerous version of me... of my game.
cuffs.
hey, i...
i don't know that part.
i went to war for you.
you should have died there.
we loved each other.
and you came back from there with a metal plate in your head and a buzzing bees in your head.
chester, stop, i can't move my feet!
stop!
stop talking!
you're distracting me.
stop, marjorie.
haven't you ruined my life enough?
you're nothing without me.
i'll show you.
all of you.
chester!
chester!
chester, stop!
what are you doing?
relax, folks... it's just a magic
magic show.
i can get her back.
again... again
alakazam!
abraka... ab
abracadabra.
that's gonna be a lot of people, chester
she made me do this.
he earned it.
what do we do now?
steal their jewels and bury the bitch.
why are you packing?
you've ruined everything again.
it's time to go.
you confused me.
you did this unconscious to sabotage me.
i had finally found happiness.
i'm leaving.
you can't leave without me.
oh.
i loved you.
chester... chester chester
oh, my god...
marjorie?
stay with me.
marjorie.
inhisdebutact as a juggler, please welcome your favorite lobster boy--
jimmy darling!
i'm not a performer like you, mom

you're star quality, jimmy.
now get your ass up and get on stage and show your mother why she's so proud of you.

elsa's next.
tonight.
looks like... now in real life... you're gonna
jimmy... jimmy...
i'm happy for you.
how dare you come in unannounced!
what do you want?
you have to go.
they've been planning revenge all day in ethel's trailer
they're gonna kill you.
why should i believe you, huh?
my monsters love me.
i'm like their mother.
ethel was more like their mother than you.
you killed their real mother.
the last nonsense of a desperate man.
who's desperate now
you saw what they did to her.
but where would i go?
anywhere but here.
you could have saved me.
we just did.
there you are.
what's jimmy doing?
he'd be here if he could.
it's time
give it to me.
ethel!
let's get some justice, girls.
oh.
thank you for coming.
i would never reject a woman in distress.
i'm not in a to
but i'm in a hurry
oh.
i want to report a murder.
who was murdered?
a young woman.
leave it here.
slowly.
put your hands where we can see them.
i did it.
send me to the stove.
what are you doing here?
i'm here to count.
i'm the new owner here.
where's elsa
she's
she's gone after her dreams
elsa sold us again.
$00,000.
nothing.
everything here, including your contracts, is now mine.
and i want to see what's mine.
was that always your dream, sir?
being in the show world?
a dream.
yeah.
and now it's becoming real.
i'm thirst
go get me a lemonade with a straw.
yes, sir.
are you ready?
yeah.
they're perfect.
i want to try it now.
sure.
the other one
you put it on
thank you.
but jesse james escaped and hid for two years.
in the great plains, the u.s. army seated bull's armies and crazy horse's armies were chasing underneath the black hills of south dakota.
after the defeat of the battle of little bighorn, the u.s. government has chosen a way to starve the lakota people and subdue them.
hold the line!
but despite their little battles against the u.s. army, the fighting of indians was getting worse.
lakota leaders sitting bull and crazy horse were running out of options.
you're a man with a strong heart.
but i'm tired.
we will.
the native americans didn't give up despite the violence that their tribes and their culture were destroyed and the violence they saw.
to go there in those days, it meant getting a chance to be rich.
many women and men have tried their luck.
as the golden economy revived, the united states became the first country to save itself from global depression.
the solution was found in
there's been plenty of cattle on the mexican border of texas for a long time.
but it wasn't possible for them to move in the plains until the railroad was completed and move to hungry people in the
the cattle that were sold for 00 bucks a head in texas was sold for 00 bucks on the east coast.
cattle barons have been buying most of the sewing area from kansas to california.
this land was giving the owners incredible opportunities.
we're talking about the land of millions of acres, the farms, and thousands and thousands of great cattle.
one of the cattle thieves in the new mexico district would be transformed into one of the very evil men of the west.
her story began 0,000 miles east.
billy never knew his father.
she and her mother moved to new mexico in the early 0000s.
he's been wandering for years without purpose.
what do you want?
whiskey.
leave the bottle.
there were different cowboys.
always sitting around the corner.
that's what you should have been paying attention
to make a living, billy used what he did best.
billy the kid was a great weapon.
he spent every dollar he'd ever made to buy bullets for practice
in a place like this, only the strong ones would survive
where are you going?
to lincoln.
i'm just passing through here
these cattle belong to john tunstall.
then john tunstall can come and get their cattle back.
it would be good for you to let me go.
i don't think so.
i don't think you have a choice
the young cattle thief, billy the kid, was captured by a farmer he tried to steal their cattle.
most people shoot cattle thieves where they see them.
you still haven't told me who you're
i don't work for anyone.
everyone works for someone in lincoln county, son.
yeah, but i don't work.
you looked like a man used to getting what he wanted to me.
you're right.
there's only one problem, and so am i.
you have a lot of men.
do you have room for one more?
when billy the kid came to lincoln, he needed a job.
john tunstall needed cowboys.
john tunstall came to the west to make a fortune.
he moved to lincoln town where he could make money.
but he's pissed off some very powerful men
lincoln was one of the wildest parts of the wild west.
it was ev's control of everything from cattle prices, lands, and government officials.
they were even paying for their law enforcement.
in fact, most of the people who lived in lincoln saw them as bully.
john tunstall came to town and stuck his nose in the beef business that's been on the house for a long time.
no one could have stayed neutral.
when billy got a job with john henry tunstall, he became tunstall's man.
within a few months, the young outlaw became tunstall's most trusted armed man.
for the first time in her life, my young orphan felt like home in the west.
tunstall was a mentor to billy the kid.
pass me your plate, billy.
thank you.
i'm starving.
it's all going well, son.
i'm glad you're here for me
thank you.
billy was always in trouble.
he was seen as a team of foot soldiers.
it was incredible and life-changing for a young man billy's age.
as billy the kid was becoming a part of the developing cattle industry that was fueling america's growth, a few hundred miles to stop expansion in the west.
calm down, gent
i extend my left hand as a friendly suggestion.
if she hadn't, most of us wouldn't be here today.
we would have died fighting instead of going to the reservation.
when they put us in the settlement, they actually took people's souls
she trusts me.
he's talking to me
god, christ.
this policy is known as "assimation."
but i think they wanted to make us capable of protecting ourselves.
there was a saying in the military.
"kill the indian and protect the man."
it means if you destroy the cultures of indians, you'll be a better man.
they thought we were wild.
the proud lakota warrior knew he had to rise again for his people.
"my people are not happy here."
"i'm not happy here."
"we don't want to live in the field of per
you're not used to life in your settlement.
give it time.
i'm sure you'll like it
after presenting their objection to the u.s. authorities, the military was afraid that the lakota warrior would set up a new indian footing.
the united states was terrified of crazy horse.
it was said that crazy horse wanted to kill a general who visited him.
the u.s. authorities were worried about a new riot rumor.
as the fear of crazy horse's plan was spread, he went to meet the authorities to clear his name for the lakota warrior.
crazy horse thought he was meeting with the united states authorities.
he didn't realize the importance of the situation
they wanted to put her in the prison cell.
then he pulled out his knife.
in spite of different views, i think the most reliable interpretation is that the white u.s. sentry kills him
crazy horse couldn't be killed in battle
his vision was right.
he was unexpectedly defeated by the guard.
on september 0, 0000, crazy horse, a man who fought his entire life to protect his people, and won war against the united states.
it's hard to talk about crazy horse's death, because even after all these years, it's so fresh.
one of the most fascinating parts of the crazy horse and the legacy he left is that there are many of the few people in the history of native american leaders.
nowadays, it is considered a symbol of brave resistance to the government of the united states, and it is spoken of self-res
i think that's why he's so strong.
with crazy horse's death, the lakota people were waiting for a leader who could save the rest of their culture.
until the house repayed catron, their welfare was also their business.
this is for you.
what if he resists?
i don't care how.
it's just my business.
roger that.
go check it out.
you stay here.
okay.
what's your hurry, gu
we heard a gunshot.
really?
don't do anything stupid, boy.
this has nothing to do with you.
it's best for her to stay like
there's always initiative interests between these competition businesses.
but like most opinions in the west, it became personal.
when someone was killed, it was personal.
that was john henry tunstall.
he was killed because of a job conflict.
it was a personal matter now.
with john tunstall's death, billy left to find his killers.
this road would take her from an unknown armed cowboy to become the legend of the west.
as the country continues to expand, men like billy the kid have realized that the border is not governed by law.
but within 000 miles of new mexico, a man was preparing to bring the law into the west.
in the plains of kansas where men take whatever they want, and every day they're struggling to survive, no one was more denty than wyatt earp.
he was big for 00th century standards.
he was very exciting with this size.
wyatt earp was one of the thousands of americans who went west to make it rich.
wyatt was infected with indestructible western disease.
he always felt the next frontier had to be forced.
this frontier could be mining, real estate, and anything to bring adventure.
that's how wyatt lived his life.
he did almost every job on the border to get it.
he did everything he could to hunt buffalo on the plains for the union pacific railroads, even to the baekje at the brothel.
the cattle were supposed to be heading towards the railroad hubs that soon returned to crowded cities, to the eastern cities.
so the rapid cities appeared.
the scene of the barren land suddenly turned into a hotel with 00 rooms.
the young men who made it to these cities were drinking whisky and carrying guns.
i mean, there were lots of young men drinking well and armed.
that's one of the reasons the west was wild.
wyatt saw that the law is not law in dodge city and the conflict is firmly solved.
she had a tough life.
either they'd go back east or they'd be worse.
but wyatt earp felt there was more to his fate.
he was gonna prove something important to history in dodge city.
you tricked the wrong guy.
that's my money.
this guy's a cheat.
calm down.
he cheated.
calm down.
he cheated.
put the gun down.
did you see his gun?
everybody saw him reaching for his gun.
give me that.
i'll shoot you!
come on.
the town of dodge desperately needed a lawman.
wyatt earp was perfect for this.
it didn't take long for wyatt earp to be appointed chief of police to dodge city.
you didn't need a special education to become a lawman.
that's not how it works in this town
wyatt earp didn't ask questions.
"kiss with uncle" is a word from him.
wyatt earp was recently famous in dodge city.
his role as a lawman would become one of the most famous figures of the west.
because cartoon chickens give my father nightmares.
where were you?
and that was irving berlin's white christmas.
it's the best-selling christmas song of
what?
actually, irving berlin wrote over 0,000 songs.
why don't you marry her?
what's wrong with you?
i'm not worried.
you have the type to write, too.
what's that supposed to mean?
what are you doing this holiday season?
hey, babe.
where are you going?
father melley called.
i need to protect the scene of christ in church.
i have to cook something for the food sales.
did you hear me complaining?
what's rhyming with poinsettia?
i forgot it again!
you're a very difficult man!
i can't produce anything in a hostile environment!
i wouldn't be hostile if you had two cents of talent!
you kick me again, i'm leaving.
your legs are crooked.
how's it going
so i brought you some soup and a thick coat.
yeah, i'll call her.
horribly ordinary!
terrible!
of course not!
yeah, and, you know, i'm an eight-and-
nice.
i'm gonna go get a bagel or something.
i'm going back to the dinner protection business
i'm calling shanghai garden.
but whatever i decide, it's gonna
i only have three days to make cake!"
she doesn't sound like that, but whate
boom!
i was gonna make a cake, but i had to work late.
and i'm exhausted.
so thank you, hungarian bakery!
says who?
larry's wife won't bring.
he's making a great cake!
you know what she's doing?
any chance you're in that town?
i really thought you were gonna make the cake!
i'm not blackm out?
she would never be with you, you know why?
because he has to get his own arm.
stop it!
great!
i've obviously been naive.
what are you doing?
i feel like you've started.
kitchen robot, big eyebrows...
let me think.
nice, easy cake recipe.
how about the one with the chocolate cereal?
at least i'm wearing a proper shirt in my pants...
a monkey could do it.
i love you.
i love you.
am i dreaming we're giants?
no.
you should have put more baking powder in there.
you don't even know what a grip is!
and nobody wants to buy this stupid toy cake!
we'll take the cake to a closed plate.
okay.
i've never had this many calves.
come here!
isn't he sewing?
after all that preparation...
anyway, try this one.
it's a good taste.
it's ok
we're not making the traditional food sale.
we're doing something more fun.
you got it.
great plan!
i didn't count on the cake walk!
i've never seen caramel do this.
this candy-covered seat knob!
come on, come on.
hey, ling.
i have your mental problem.
well, when i...
elaine?
whatever.
i see him, but he's in slow
how long has this been going on?
what does that mean?
i think you're in love.
how do i get out of this
i got myself together.
i'm ready to sing now.
tonight i seek my soul.
i know there's a lot more to life waiting for me.
thank you for having me.
how can i help you?
my wife cindy, died two years ago.
we were married for three years.
he was hit by a car on our anniversary.
cindy and i wanted to have kids.
for example, that he was dead.
how do you do that?
did she leave her egg or embryo?
no.
did you hear me?
i heard.
to clone your dead wife?
scientists are trying it under hand, mr. cage.
so i secretly attempted it for cindy.
my sister-in-law heard that and hired a lawyer to stop it.
that's why i need a lawyer.
he's going to court today.
yes, mr. stoller, i must say, i'm sure your wife was a great man.
but the idea of cloning?
please.
there's nowhere else i can apply.
and your firm has met this lawyer before.
who is it?
larry paul.
i hear you're very successful.
it was him.
how can you have a virtual relationship?
a relationship means communication.
what about "o"?
i know you don't like it, but if her hands aren't on the stupid pole, she can
all you care about is control.
i don't
really?
and you came here to talk about my virtual relationship?
i came to borrow something.
but forget it.
ally?
can you take a look?
it's the lawyer on the other side, larry
is that so?
there's a conflict of interest for me here, isn't there?
you're responsible for the client.
yeah, but...
didn't you use small information from the inside when you were defending him
no, but i... no,
why wouldn't i?
just for the client.
my case is too little passionately.
i need something.
larry's weakness is rhythm.
she talks to me too fast when she's arguing, because she knows i can't understand what
okay.
he's vulnerable when he loses his
okay.
you're in your dreams with cindy margolis.
michelle garris e-mailed me and asked me a way to get into hollywood.
we met in hollywood and...
do it!
i won't let myself drive.
we can't deny our passion anymore.
you want me, i want you.
let's be honest.
you do my knee, and i'll have my hair glued.
you're breaking my spinal cord.
don't you like denial?
then let's be honest.
i'm leaving
i went to l.a., and i didn't even think of you.
jackson's got your mind.
people accuse me of being superficial.
but when it comes to relationships, i understand human behavior.
in the last month, you were shaving your legs in the morning.
is that your thesis?
if a woman's shaving her legs not at night, but in the morning, it's over.
no exceptions.
go to jackson.
he's the man you're crazy
first of all, cloning people is against society order...
the court hasn't been court-
while people are against cloning sheep...
this is none of your business.
you won't let me go to second...
"the second" is a sexual term.
i completely object.
i wish i could just go back to the sheep.
these rude things have no place in court.
let's get to the decision.
soon?
let's hear what mr. paul has to say.
secondly, forgive my rudeness...
she's kidding
...and even if she can be cloned, she can't make that decision, mr. stoller
too much.
i'm predictable in law cases, but i'm unprepared for too much.
she made fun of me three times.
i apologize for writing, preferably notarized.
four times!
is this cloning possible?
first, i want to listen to your client and find out why.
your honor, i hope...
see you tomorrow.
see ya.
ling denies even what he wants.
how do you feel?
he can have her.
the man's deep, a ink bottle.
i mean, i hope ling drowned.
are you really okay?
yeah.
actually, john cage was the lawyer on the other side.
did you know?
how'd it
it's against their principles to smile.
what's going on?
don't ask me
john wanted a few clues he could use against you in court, and i told him to break your rhythm.
you're useless without rhythm.
cute but useless.
you gave him advice?
his client is my client.
we're sleeping with you.
you're behind my back.
you're giving him advice when you can't beat me?
does john know you'll never beat me?
excuse me?
does john know you never beat me?
no, no.
never?
isn't her smile nice?
she's cute
one day i'm gonna beat you, but john's gonna beat you with my advice today.
great.
i'll lose my superiority.
no, you won't.
now he knows i'm trying to break his rhythm.
he said you'd never beat him.
not only in this case, no case.
did he say that?
yeah.
i bet you, john.
she said i could never beat her?
exactly.
never?
never.
of course.
i can date a man in paris.
you can go as far away from here as you like.
i'm not gonna get you into this.
no, i don't.
how was i?
larry?
why did you come?
i thought john and i could walk together.
you're trying to confuse me, i won't let you.
i saw her smile.
it wasn't supportive
everything all right, john?
you look a little restless.
he's trying to make the upper hand, but it's
good.
do you want to have dinner?
i'd love to
i'm full today, but how about tomorrow
great.
we always talked about having children.
i think i want to fulfill cindy and my dream.
but you're not talking about having cindy's child.
you want to clone her.
the only way to maintain her genetic legacy is cloning.
there are many people, including mr. paul, who sat down as a gayricid...
your honor, i'd like to stand up very quickly.
mr. paul, sit down.
mr. cage, don't provoke it.
many people find the idea of cloning, disgusting.
but i'm not a scientist trying to make the living species perfect.
and i know i can't bring cindy back.
i want to make sure the generation lasts.
and i don't think i want her extinct.
thank you.
first of all, i'm sorry for your
but you're trying to copy cindy, right?
this is the process of creating a complete genetic replica of your dead wife.
her appearance, her speech is the same...
did cindy ever mention genetically engineered fruit?
she was against it.
what about the genetically engineered chickens?
she was against it, too.
but it was clear to the idea of a genetically engineered replica of his own repl
it's not the
it's not all about chickens, counselor.
i didn't say that.
i'm nervous enough without you.
you wouldn't let anyone get your number.
whatever makes you great, you must win it again.
maybe melanie scared him away.
john, i'm sorry, man.
but remember, larry said you'd never beat him.
never.
you should think big now.
because this time, i won't rub his feet.
whatever happens, you have to find barry white.
yeah.
yeah.
come on!
we did it together, baby.
does ally know?
the pressure doesn't help me.
would you excuse me?
of course.
just you and me.
bullshit!
how does this cloning work?
very impressive.
we're getting eggs from the donors we injected the reproduction meds.
from the cloning candidate, this cindy stoller, we're getting a cell.
this part is very impressive.
the witness said it was impressive before.
is this the only part impressive?
then we pull every egg core with a needle.
the needle in cloning is too much.
we're putting her dna out to the transmitter cell.
this is cindy's cell.
and we're doing energy.
what does that mean?
we're just doing a little bit of a shocking, kind of
i'm trying to understand.
you're refusing to kill bugs and i find it gross, even for a public supervisor.
let's continue.
you're both falling out of my sight.
after the energy was given, what happens to the cells?
with their donor cells, when the dnaless cells are given energy, they are bonding together.
and then we put them in the surrogate mother and it turns out to be a cloned baby.
semen?
no, that's very impressive.
is that really possible?
i must admit, most embryos die.
but there's a chance one will succeed.
we've already tried it on sheep.
it's possible for humans.
how far is this technology?
it's available for now.
people don't expect science.
science is waiting for people.
thank you, doctor.
hey, mark.
if you need anything, have your assistant call mine.
i don't see you in slow motion anymore, you two-faced jackal.
i see it.
maybe another time.
what's going on
i'll tell you at dinner somet
forget it.
what's wrong with you?
what's wrong with me?
i put myself before you.
i threw it like a cannon.
you know what a big thing this is for me?
i made you a gesture.
i told you i was in love last week.
anyone can share such a stupid feeling.
please.
i want something very small.
closing statements are coming up, you should be with me.
together, we can beat larry.
just you and me.
come on!
you've come to the end
what else do you have to do?
did you come?
you're here
that's why i'm starting the day with bread caps.
he was here.
who?
barry white was here.
forgive me for not knowing that.
my concentration.
it's not the same.
i can't bring her with other people in the room.
most people can't dance with imaginary giants in front of others.
i used to bring her all the time
i used to walk with her on a crowded street
no, that's what you have to do
call him in the bunker, alone.
first you take him out without a cut, then go out, go among the people
i don't know if i can.
you have to.
without barry, what are you?
look at this.
you can't live your life like
you have no choice but to find barry.
they'll take her personality, her dna.
your brother-in-law loved your brother.
excuse me, i'll do my objections like this.
he won't bring cindy back.
even the only egg twins are told, sharing the same dna, different people.
even when she's taking organs of one person, she needs permission.
the copy of the dna is a much more aggressive attitude.
it means breaking into their specialty.
i'm sorry.
was it mine?
i didn't mean to push.
it's been a
don't you want to see your brother's genes continue?
she'll look like him, talk like him.
i wonder if she wouldn't want that?
she was against genetic research the whole time.
she absolutely didn't want this
never.
you have a computer.
i want some privacy.
from brazil.
it's our first literally speaking conversation.
i feel really good for her.
but hurry up.
i'm the one who's gonna rub her
did you find barry white?
any signs?
forget it!
couldn't you find your own office?
yours is closer to court and my feet hurt a little.
i have no idea.
elaine!
things followed each other.
would you stop following me?
you think that's what i do?
i didn't ignore you.
i thought you weren't interested.
you were right.
"let it go, deja vu."
you've been angry since i came to this firm.
i'm angry because you lied to me.
i'm angry because i slept with you.
it's hard to get around happy all the time.
it's hard to be a cheerle
i don't understand why you do it every day.
obviously, we're both a little ashamed of the beginning we did.
then why don't we make a fresh start?
you may be right.
or not.
jackson.
how are you?
i'm not complaining.
this definitely belongs to both of us, right?
he's up to something.
yes, it is.
no one, just you and me.
he's a funny little guy, isn
it's okay with me
it's about
it's like being dr. frankenstein.
the idea of getting some organs started?
picking dna?
these are terrible.
we could have hockey teams loaded with wayne gretzky copies.
with a pit bull, they can connect mike tyson.
the odds.
the horror.
but the truth is that every time science is new every step, the worries of humanity will rise.
we've already made tubes, your honor.
we're playing with the genes
this technology will save lives.
is there any risk of abuse?
of course, there is.
my client knows the will and dreams of her husband.
dreams they had together.
this process will allow the chance to continue the family legacy they hoped for.
we have to be open to science that makes a couple have children.
it can't be who owns her dna, can it?
i remind mr. paul that the wife in life, the organs of his dead wife, may not be of consent.
mr. paul, i'm just saying this because he can say the wrong things about mrs. stoller's wishes.
but there's no reason to believe that.
you can't be sure when you can talk.
now it's your turn.
i may not have a legal reason.
but i have a moral compass.
that's what this is about.
then why would he stay there?
she can clone her mother.
her grandfather.
one day, their kids can play with their grandmother's twins in the sandbox.
celebrities can start selling their dna.
imagine being a parent to barry white's twin sister.
once the technology is in place of breeding, will the line be crossed?
once, we were afraid of heart transplants.
the idea of anomaly was considered anomaly.
now the truth of life and society accept it.
cloning organs, saving life, destroying diseases.
these can be real.
but to clone a human being to clone a human being to duplicate his dna and do the same?
dismissed.
i'm sorry
i appreciate the effort.
i don't want a rematch
hey.
hey.
do you come here often?
that's my introduction.
it's a terrible introduction.
has it ever worked before?
better.
do you want to go to the bar?
not tonight.
because you beat larry?
it's not
to tell you the truth, i didn't want to win this time.
no, i want to be alone tonight.
she's alone
not at all.
like you said, most people don't dance with a imaginary disco giant.
you're not cra
honestly, i'm a little jealous
when you're disappointing in the real world, you're
hey.
maybe the three of us can walk.
give me a chance.
if he doesn't, i'm still here.
well, i'll do it.
let's go.
who knew karaoke night would be the greatest party on the street?
you told p. diddy and kissinger?
i say, "islands in the stream" was never said that.
the limo driver called and said...
embarrassing a multimillionaire donald trump's wedding?
sam, i've been in vegas for 00 minutes, but i haven't even played a hand blackjack yet.
your favorite table's ready.
ladies love a good karaoke singer, danny.
call me back.
you think you can get any girl you want?
pick it up.
it's a solo mission, my
he's here for the new virgin nature convention.
girls who aren't technically virgins can change
the card counters shot two hotels this month and the last shift report says there's big losses on the blakjack tables.
there's a card counter downst
ed thinks there might be a card counter.
maybe we can have this conversation later, like drinking.
patty, it's been three and you've been here a
i didn't pay my rent and the only reason the landlady would let me stay
listen, i'm sorry, but this is a business.
if we pay for every shirt you screw up, i'm screwed up.
all right, the gift cans are packed and waiting to go to the guest rooms.
our florist brought the orchids and the last 0,000 will come tomorrow.
however, if for some reason he doesn't come, a ship for my tulips from amsterdam...
mary, don't worry.
i'm sure everything will be fine.
you're the most comfortable bride i've
thank you for coming, galina.
that's a hundred thousand dress.
a hundred thousand dollars?
like i said, first for me.
a lot more than we lost.
it doesn't mean playing with a certain duck.
numbers sit on a table and play if there's rich, right?
the unsub, redheaded, blonde, headed west.
thank you.
mr. sperreos, i'm from security.
it's the question i always ask.
we haven't been married yet, and you've been out all night.
no good.
honey, i'm winning here.
it's over for tonight and so are yours.
all right.
i told donald trump that our wedding would be like a delicious chicken wing compared to the party at palm beach.
my team has been trying to make your wedding for months to make the biggest, chicest wedding this town has ever seen.
come on.
even when she was a secretary, she was always like the
why are you so helplessly romantic?
when your commission might stop, montecito will still be ahead, and that's all i care about.
let's go, everybody
the guy in the trailer told us he told us that they'd drop the cold of the air.
he can mark the 00s and see that the game is rich.
he's been sitting in that slot machine all night, rarely plays.
and he doesn't take his eyes off the blakjack table.
a minute before sperreos gets in a game, he gets up and likes to win the game.
you can't prove it.
even if i count the cards, it's not
that's technically true.
but we have a different sense of justice in vegas.
like i used to, i could catch a cheat and destroy it in the desert.
i'll be honest with you, i'm old-fashioned.
please.
now that we have your picture, you're in the black book.
if you step inside the montecito, i'll have you arrested in private.
did you hear that?
hey, jack!
he's got us down to 000,000.
you know it's not as illegal as i do, and he didn't have it.
at least we can have some fun with her.
not the story.
if somebody's financing them and teaching them things, it's not the end of
this is mike from last night, from mystique.
he's not from phoenix.
there are other cities you're not really from
des moines, for example.
it's amazing, but i have to go.
i'm devastating and burning, aren't
you finally said something i agreed with.
i think you should be the problem because i'm usually charming.
so, what?
maybe i'm a little nervous around you because you're so
i'm getting tongue-
you know what we're gonna do?
what is it?
we're gonna sit down and try to figure out why you're not
patty.
it was almost there.
did they say i'm okay?
it doesn't matter if you're okay
i should fire you.
please.
thank you, thank you, thank you.
the tailor said he sent it back this morning, but there's no record of him arriving.
000 of our friends are coming to this wedding tomorrow, president of the state, head of industry, op
would you like to tell oprah that the wedding was canceled and came to las vegas for nothing?
if we don't, montecito would be happy to get the same.
that dress was a fashion masterpiece.
a dozen french tailors sewed a dozen of them with
there's no other one like that.
you know how much that dress cost me?
this is a big problem, sam?
wait.
hey, danny, you asked me to look at the big blackjack winners.
the montecito has already spent millions on food, flowers, decor, entertainment.
if the wedding isn't as planned and lipworth refuses to give it.
do you really think someone stole it?
what's the street value on that thing?
why not the tailor galina?
she was interested when she heard the cost of the dress.
mike.
hey.
let me know how it goes.
are these the same techniques that sperreos and his team used?
we catch a team, they send someone else in a few hours.
if we don't find what's behind this, we might have to give them the key to the safe.
you'd better talk right now, you bastard.
are you talking to sperreos?
you'd better get your hands off me, because the president's attack on me will cause more than i won blackjack.
that was good.
did i get the dress?
i just want to know what happened.
i make changes and hand over the dress to the montecito messenger.
there's a camera in the store?
i saw real diamonds in a costume that was meant for elton john.
compared to that, this dress is nothing.
galina protects herself.
you're free to go.
i'm helping, patty.
god knows why i agreed to this project?
i've always helped the baby bird, even if we have rabies.
then i'll get my tray.
this is christina, one of our best waitresses.
knees bent, back of the back.
above all, trust.
trust.
she's full of martinis with her tray of
it's gonna be the hardest
she doesn't even look at glasses.
she believes in her ability to do what's right and here she is.
team zen.
you're not so zen.
breathe with me, patty.
be like booze, patty.
you want me to sit here until mystique opens?
thank god i don't want you standing here like karate kids.
call me sensei.
vic, you sent one of your staff to the store this morning to buy a dress.
yeah.
do you remember who you sent?
the tailor gave me a record, but i couldn't remember the face
bart, you went to the store this morning to get a dress.
no, i didn't go.
why not?
when i was about to leave, joey stopped me, and he wanted to go
scan joey's face and get his address for me.
thank you.
i'm sorry
the caviar sea caviar.
why would he turn his chips on him?
did you hear from the dress?
yes, candy.
who's candy
it's not because i know it's forbidden here, but
do you know where we can find it?
danny mccoy, montecito surveillance and security.
how do you know nick sperreos?
cops don't scare me.
okay, wait, wait.
all right, all right.
that's enough
okay, i know him.
he came here a few times with his friends.
these are his friends?
you know these things?
yeah, i guess so.
nick's a good kid.
and then she asked me to break the chips.
i guess he thought i wouldn't doubt it.
strippers are always rewarded with a receipt.
look, it was good for five minutes of work, and i didn't need to take off my clothes
why are you so interested?
because sperreos and his friends were involved in some kind of card counting operation.
i thought they were just some rich kids.
there's someone behind this and i need to find out who.
do you have any idea who's training these and financed them?
once they came with a big one.
yeah, they called him bucky.
mitch, did you scan joey's face?
fast forward.
someone's paying him.
can you expand the picture?
no, but i can get another angle.
so, lissy's fiancée, lippworth'
we need to talk.
but you already know that, right?
i know you paid to get rid of the officer's dress.
the point is, why not?
this wedding, this wedding, the details, the cost, the cost
listen.
it's a little weird, if you want to leave.
that's the point.
i don't know if i want to leave.
i love her, but her life...
i mean, how many of the 000 people are my friends?
people say this is a cinderella story.
i'm not cinderella.
i'm just a regular new jersey girl.
i may not know too much, but considering my wedding is 00 times the cost of my family's house...
that's not true
it is.
jared and i are very different.
i mean, what harm can it do?
how old do you think these kids are?
00, no bigger than 00.
danny, those are the yearbooks you wanted
we'll see.
they're all in their mid-00s and they all have the mathematical ability to count cards.
then they must be from the math department and trained children.
and then i remembered, how can i put them on line?
considering how the second team got here, i started from local colleges.
because you're a great guy and i'm interested in the less attractive ones.
maybe it's time for a
listen, mike, there's something i need to tell you before i go this far.
i'm here to vegas for the virginity kogra of the family.
renewed.
i've made mistakes with the men in my past, and i wanted to make a clean slate, and i made a vow of chastity until i got married.
i mean, it wouldn't make her less valuable than before.
nice marriage officer.
good.
what's up
do you want to go back to school?
i want to go back and do an anthropology degree and go to the rainforest and study the native folk.
you're such an idiot.
what's up, ruben?
if you touch me, i'll call my lawyer right now.
you gonna call your lawyer?
what do you want?
where's bucky?
i don't know what you're talk
we have records of you robbing the montecito.
i don't think the students here like that kind of thing.
i can call the dean right now and get your ass out of here.
please, don't tell my family.
hey.
hey.
did you ever hear of being born a virgin again?
so you always knew that?
i'm sorry, but i could get all the girls i wanted, and the bullshit just turned out
yeah, i set you up with a very sweet and beautiful guy.
you were gonna quit because she wouldn't sleep with
hey, where are you going?
hey, mike.
i won't need you.
hey.
i acted like an idiot.
i needed some time to get through all this.
do you think there's a place in your heart that can give me a second chance?
is that room service that brings cream, baby?
excuse me.
what was all that precious gift stuff?
'cause to me, it's just that christmas after year's eruption paper clips around.
look, i was born again five or six times.
and why not me?
i tried to change.
so this is my fault?
i'm really sorry.
i took your advice.
i talked to jared and told him everything.
the wedding's
i said the wedding's off, not the marriage
does bucky train his team here?
hey, ruben, if it's funny, you know your parents on the
bucky.
mr. buckner?
you know him?
i'm a math teacher in high
i'm the head of security at the montecito
yeah.
remember mrs. buckner?
last year, he ran off with coach kaoyan.
alimony is killing me.
night school debts.
but tax evasion is.
you guys made a lot of money from a lot of casinos
i'm guessing some of that money wasn't reported to the tax office
keep these card counters off the montecito, and we'll forget what happened.
before these kids leave, danny gets their picture and information.
what's the food on the left?
oh, my god.
did you miss the flowers, the caviar and oprah?
you know i don't care about those things.
all that matters is spending the rest of my boat with you.
delinda, i'm sorry
he has to listen to you, honey.
i'll make you a star.
i hope you wrote it down somewhere.
be careful, we're about to enter.
do i know you?
vinny, she's hanging out with your
do you really want to risk your life for a skirt and a geezer?
any sign of the professor?
i know six languages, why... why...
stein's gonna kill sara in the library.
the speedster's disguised as stein, and he's turning over the ship.
since when do you call him jax?
unfortunately, the effect won't last
what did you do to stein?
capone's men are taking over the ship.
you're here because i killed jsa's stupid leader.
it was mr. rex tyler, wasn't
i don't want to spend the night here.
you're welcome, you drunks.
my job is better.
i'm in charge of the entire arena.
every night, 00,000 people come here for fun, and i make sure they have fun.
are you an actor?
yeah.
okay.
tell springsteen i'm the boss here.
don't say that.
she'll do anything she wants, so say
have you seen a hot marketing director around here?
where you been, man?
i have a meeting after the game.
how much time do we have left?
0 minutes, 00 seconds.
i can do a lot in 0 minutes, 00 seconds.
you're a funny girl.
i'm seeing other people.
i'm seeing other people.
happy birthday, ben.
how do you know?
good morning.
all right.
happy birthday, ben.
you're a maintenance man, right?
two years ago, you told me to say "yes."
a little deceiving because you don't always ask yes or no questions.
forget about that for now.
there's gonna be a circus here tonight, and if there's ice on the floor, those fire-breathing kids can fall on their sticks.
you understand?
you also told me not to run in the hallway.
forget about the conversation we had two years ago.
oh, no, no, no.
he wants to talk.
that's not good, man.
melt that ice, bobbert.
benjamin!
come here.
hurry up.
crystal, before you get angry and start kicking everybody out, about that ice...
did you see a little white pill with spanish written on it?
i don't understand your level of attention.
or did i already take that pill?
hello.
yeah, i think you already took the pill.
i hate the circus here.
are they happy?
are they sad?
why are their pockets so big?
i'm sure you're talking about clowns.
good morning, beautiful people.
good morning, alonzo.
you're in an incredibly awesome mood again.
every day is a beautiful day, my friend.
seriously, every day?
ben, that was the best day ever.
that was the day i stopped taking care of myself and started committing myself to the great people of san diego.
what are you doing?
i have to get that pill out of my system.
what about today's charity meeting?
i've invested a lot of money on illegal himalaya dog racing.
one of the dogs allegedly bit one of the himalayas.
anyway, i have a himalay nightmare.
can't we use that money to make it better?
all right, you're the owner here, we'll do what you say.
did you see the oil painting?
don't forget to bring some kind of kid for
you know, black, white.
get me an asian kid
and we're gonna need a cup.
the asian kid will give me a trophy.
you're right to clap, because these are very good ideas.
benjamin, i almost forgot.
your... son?
how's your new assistant working out?
thank you for that.
he set a man on fire?
there was an investigation.
the evidence was inconclusive
i mean, yes.
he's fine, isn't
she set him on fire.
not very well.
a-a-al-al-al-
alonzo...
what do you think it means when a girl sends a message, "we need to talk"?
i'm in something similar.
i think you'll have a better chance of getting closer.
what could be better than that?
yeah, that's what i thought.
happy new year, little man.
good morning, heather.
good morning.
i'll tell you why i love it.
ben!
there's a man in your office, and he's
okay.
hey.
hey.
is there anyone else here besides you, someone a little more attractive than you?
no.
okay.
i'm ben
i'm roman.
so you're crystal's son.
this must be terrible for you.
yeah.
it's not perfect.
i wonder how they swam in the water.
okay.
i like mafia movies.
as a gift as a
this place is exciting.
there are political meetings, sports, rodeo, night footballs, motorcycle racing.
don't you care about any of this?
remember me?
i sent you three messages, and you didn't answer any of them.
i guess after five months of sleeping together, you should've found out that the messages that remain unanswered me were
look, i know we hate commitment.
i'll take that "friends with you."
but this morning, i woke up at your house alone, which means you snuck out of the house.
i couldn't find my underwear until i left my wallet when i was paying for the coffee.
i bought another cup of coffee with this, and more...
who's that?
and i like mafia movies.
you and i, we really need to talk.
yes, it is, because this is the chance to get closer.
what could be better than that?
this is a good business opportunity for you.
i'll see you at the christmas party.
i don't think that's what you meant
speak spanish.
i know a little spanish.
yeah, i don't know what you're saying.
actually, your english is very good.
elephant!
crystal.
did you hear what i just said?
i didn't hear
let me see this.
i don't think you should say, "yay, black kids."
well, when should i say?
i don't think you should say anything.
and i wouldn't sing the song either.
there's still ice.
yeah, i know.
that doesn't sound sad to me.
this is your way of life.
you never wanted someone who was emotionally dependent on you, wondering how and where you were, kissing you in the morning, waiting for you at home.
what's so good about celebrating on your birthday?
but you throw big parties on your birthday.
i need to know i'll never be alone.
i'm not sure what to do now.
i'll get out, you step on the gas, go.
thank you.
niggers, whites, asians and asians
don't sing that song.
i think we should go to dinner to celebrate my birthday.
that would be a good step for our relationship.
i think we should be together.
i'm willing to end this relationship.
why did you let me talk first?
you go first.
you go first in all our chatter from now on.
remember how we said we were seeing other people?
alonzo?
he's my best friend.
she's been wanting to live with me for a while.
he wants to be tied up.
he wants a commitment?
it's a man we're talking about,
what a man.
look, i'm
alonzo is an adult.
he cares about other people, too.
she's asking questions about me, and she's been listening to my answers.
what bothers me is that i thought we were the same.
when you said you were emotionally damaged,
how did she react when you told her?
he was already a very happy man.
that must have blown her to the air.
live with me.
we can do the commitment thing.
honey, i'm not the right woman for you.
you're sweet, you're great for fun.
but no one can be the right person for you, because you only think about yourself.
what the hell was that?
i think the sound was coming through my head.
i can't be a frying master.
i guess so.
you know what the worst thing is?
i don't think of anyone but myself.
it's really impossible for me to take care of other people
suddenly, i feel the need to make a connection, but i have no idea how to do it.
i'm in trouble, man.
kermit the frog, right?
yeah.
what about her?
i think it's a great
come on, man.
sunlight.
hey, ben.
hey.
he's a very attractive
excuse me.
does anyone know how to use an axe?
come on, clowns.
it's almost over
keep breaking it.
good day.
where's the asian
i specifically requested an asian kid.
there's an asian kid over there.
alonzo.
yeah.
yeah.
thank you.
they've stopped.
most of the time, people ask why i love children so much.
maybe because i never had my own child.
i believe that the happiness of our children is the health of the society that we want to live in, and the people living in this society.
they're our most important concern because they're our future.
when you ask them to do something for you, they do it with enthusiasm.
or as i get older, i'm beginning to believe that a life you only live for is empty.
i wasn't going to, but i have to share a little song i wrote in this special occasion with you.
aside from the musical portion, your speech was really touching.
sometimes it's really fun working with you.
i'm incredibly happy right now
on three, everyone say, "thank you, crystal cohen."
two... two...
oh, my god!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
what a wonderful moment.
i noticed she left a little early.
hello again.
are you really okay?
i'm a little scared
sure.
it's normal that you think you're picking the right guy
i'm 000% sure i picked the right guy.
all right.
what a wonderful moment.
i've never done this before.
what if i'm not ready
what if she's just acting like she wants me?
after she has me, what if she doesn't want me any
of course she wants you.
you have everything.
there's everything.
okay?
okay.
okay.
in fact, we can have sex one last time.
hey, crystal.
i really want to make love to her.
i'll see what i can do.
can you pay attention to the poor boy you threw in the air?
fortunately, i persuaded them to post this picture.
more than when you kicked the police.
less than screwing the mayor's boat.
great.
great.
while i got you, i...
i want you to sit here and talk to the person who will be incredibly useful in the sunlight center, with childish joy and loyalty.
get in the car.
get in the car.
i'm sure you have a lot to talk about.
great.
happy birthday, ben.
thank you.
hey.
what's your name
dan.
thank you, dan.
i've already forgotten
have you seen alice?
he's in
it was about work.
i'm
i know what you mean.
what do you do in a situation like this?
i think i'll run like my life depends on it.
yeah, that's what i'm gonna
they've set up surveillance cameras looking directly to paddy
melts in your mouth.
he rebels against everything you say.
this is bullshit, man.
these guys finally realized that living with me was realizing that dee was so cool and so funny.
dee, you're on a secret mission, okay
dee, we're putting you on this mission to charlie's, but are there any questions or arrogance and questions we're
maybe we'll go upstairs to the
do i have to know the man who put spaghetti in his face?
i'll buy one for the man i don't know behind me.
i said why.
'cause i think you've been hanging out a long time
i didn't, because charlie was interrupted by his goddamn emergency lunch.
i don't want to equate what you've come across.
as i told you a few minutes ago, we're running out of fish today.
instead, let's all get a plate of hot pipe spaghett
and extra sauce on top.
i've always wanted to see that.
comedians, baseball players, even protestors.
god bless cream pie and america.
look, i'm an experienced businessman with a long history of asian countries.
imagine my delicious cream pie recipe with your underpaid labor force.
the factory was shut down for a few days because of all the accidents i've been
the fact is, we're pretty good at chinese factory.
i don't think you need to worry like she's okay
it's just some old porn
everyone to the tucker train.
it's not exactly what it looks like.
no, no.
these are the things my children cared about when they were young
besides, you know when he couldn't sell all this crap in the garage.
these boxes show how wonderful our lives have been.
like they've always been fake identity to you?
the pictures i made in kindergarten and thanksgiving hand turkey?
i'm sorry, honey.
i'll put the finger here because i have a feeling something's changed here.
not just danny wearing a jersey uniform and hitting a bat.
they were in the basement next to new year's christmas lights, and i realized that ms. bart lost her shiva.
i just didn't see you had a plan to win.
yeah, you gave us free beer, and then you said, "vote for me."
we're very fortunate that everyone has withdrawn
i'm not really doing anything about sports anymore.
god, it feels like it's a different life.
i need to hit something with a stick for a beer.
okay, brawlers, i'd like to propose a toast before the game.
maybe we'll remember that winning isn't everything, but we have a barrel of beer!
wait.
everyone, this is riley and my daughter emma.
so, wheeler's heading 0-0 with unplanned pregnancy
tuck, why don't you give the new guys something?
ben!
that's what i know at work.
are you going out with mom?
i was gonna talk to her myself, but bonnie said she'd handle it.
i got it, but i didn't tell her
you can't say you're taking it well
i mean, after your mom's meeting with coach, they can do a pillow talk in bed.
if i called the girl that you did happy hours ago, we'd be happy that you were chopped up.
we could have more babies.
i'm gonna go practice until my brain is exhausted.
she's blowing her food around, i think she's doing it well.
her father's
mom's coming soon, will you take the equipment down to the field for me?
it's more than my weighted earlier.
you don't care about the cups on the shelf,
sounds like i missed the game.
you missed another little thing.
the kids voted for riley to become captain.
i was just saying that you lost it.
i was feeding my baby and you took my team away.
i was wearing your glove... and then everyone started yelling.
"you're amazing!"
because i heard it was "incredible".
maybe if you come to my place, you'll do some good things i haven't done in
because i don't care what the others say.
"your face, suckers." i'm so excited!
we just had some italian food.
that's why i'm trying to stop you.
honey, i don't think we should talk about this part of my personal life.
okay, honey, i know you don't want to hear this, but i'm a woman and i have needs.
i won't even open my mouth.
"make the blood."
i don't want anyone to cancel their plans.
thank you, danny.
not yet, but it will be.
honey, are you okay?
i tried to come as soon as i could.
and with that, you're 00 minutes away.
i couldn't call anyone to take care of emma.
the dentist said he should see you right away.
and remember, don't bring home the giant toothbrush.
for the bathroom key.
i'm sorry about your date with hank.
i shouldn't even be talking to you right now.
please tell me emma's in the car outside the park.
i don't know if hank canceled something, or the details.
but if mom asks, they kept me here.
you care about other people's happiness.
to make sure she doesn't see and hope she doesn'
dude, you gotta go back.
you think she stopped being a rigantor?
she's gonna make me whisper little planets in my head?
will you look here?
the minister went home.
if it's not hank, it'll be like someone
do you have a menu down here?
mom, i'm home.
what are you doing here?
i'm sure it's my robe.
hank, are you ready for round two?
danny, there's nothing going on here
you're unbelievable.
yeah, she hates it.
because we don't watch the same game here.
it's actually full of vodka.
we'll drink this and launch it.
we have a chance to make a clean shot.
sit down, wheeler to the other ladies.
what about riley?
okay, tuck, your turn.
hit him again, don't miss and get out of the field
when i told riley something that wasn't supposed to hear, she ate my crayons.
i can't forget you're still eating brown.
don't worry, i'll watch your back, okay?
hey, teammates.
don't you look cute today?
is that my phone?
something about the game.
thank god.
i was worried i couldn't bring you back.
i know what you're thinking, but you gotta do something other than check the team.
like i'm doing right now?
i want you to be more serious in the games.
i'm having a harder time putting you in the squad than the others.
to tell you the truth, i have to get you off the team.
but i can't
i'm really gonna miss you when i don't play you.
thank you.
what did you want to tell me?
it's
"tick, riley's gone.
"i'm firing him right now."
what's this
that's a bad version of what i just told you.
coach, can we talk?
i think you want your robe back.
it didn't
my mother told me what happened.
i'm really sorry about that reaction.
i'll say i'll be better next time.
i don't think there's gonna be
don't blame him for being a punk.
you mean you keep a funny woman out of your league?
no, that's my mother you're talking about
and someone who goes out with her gets lucky.
i'll go out with her
it'll be safe if you put it
what's wrong with me?
maybe you're just so smart and so beautiful.
winning is fun for you.
oh, my god, i like it!
but what will it get me?
the room full of cups and no one has to share it with me?
looks like danny figured it out
yeah, none of us are gonna be like your brother.
yeah, i think i've heard it a couple or a thousand times.
that's
that's
i was thinking of a change in progress for the win.
i've never tried it before.
yeah, i think you should figure out how to get real brawlers out without me.
ben, nobody wants me.
go brawlers!
all thanks to my dear deputy captain.
if riley wasn't with the referee
she really needed a new glass.
no, i can't hide anymore.
honey, you have to help me.
the fear in their eyes has made them close.
get lost.
don't worry.
i'll find a man who can make you happy.
okay.
she seems to be heading for better.
i know when i see my son at work.
as i always say, thank god for giving me ben.
do the wheeler, do the wheeler...
what's riley doing?
they call her as wheeler.
we'll use you to watch this from the inside.
why is patty interested in this murder?
i advise mr. purcell not to answer any further questions.
you were found alone at home with your wife's body.
there's no sign of a break-in.
patty, i saw the man who did this.
our company was hired to do toxicological studies on a chemical composition.
these companies are worth hundreds of billion dollars.
michael, this is daniel purcell.
we have a containment problem.
she's the head consultant for the third largest energy
did you tell anyone about us?
the acid rain from coal-burning plants brings the bullets levels above 00 times the national average.
the residents tried to make a public case.
so they've had over 000 cases filed against them over the last three years?
why didn't he bribe you
i'm wondering the same thing, but i don't know how patty knew we were setting tom up.
what did you find on purcell?
we need to make sure our secret still doesn't show up so we can move forward.
it's okay with me.
ellen, i know it's disappointing, but you have to back off.
we'll all retreat.
it might help me.
i don't have any experience in criminal law
we must have chased him before he had time to steal something.
it was dark the first time.
you know, last night, i was wondering if someone stirred the house.
isn't it your job to find out, detective?
let's see if there's anything in the photos that can revive your
mr. purcell didn't come here to be harassed.
he always did.
this is a very important development, mr. purcell.
if you find the ring, you'll find my wife's killer
mr. purcell, i believe you.
'cause whoever killed christine is still out there and you're absolutely no good at it.
you can't use these against me.
don't answer that.
i could swear he acted like he wanted to be arrested.
the only event that happened three years ago wasn't possible
no, but he seems to be lying about everything.
i mean, she's been going home twice and nothing's been stolen
doesn't the contaminator have any health damage?
we've talked on the phone a few times, but i don't think she still accepts it.
he wants to introduce me to the man he's with
if there's something we need to know, patty will tell us when she's ready.
whatever you've infected the company, it's better if nothing comes out of stolen documents.
if you're wondering what happened to christine purcell, look at the grieving widow.
my only job is to protect mr. kendrick and you did something to expose him or ultima national resources...
is everything okay in new york?
daniel purcell, i'm meeting with patty hewes.
do you have reason to believe that ultima national resources was involved in the murder of your wife?
i've been watching a lot of farm animals die.
00 years ago, he used daniel purcell as an expert witness and made a case.
then why was ibc global's report suggesting that 000 parts perm was acceptable?
daniel purcell was a brilliant man, but when he faced patty, he collapsed.
no, it's just another big conspiracy to expose for you.
as soon as i tell you what i know about ultima national, you throw me away.
whatever he tells you, you can't trust him.
i don't know who killed your wife, but you'll be blamed for it.
he and purcell worked together before ibc global.
about nine months after purcell's testimony, michael was born.
it's just
we'll face unexpected elements.
we will neutralize them with a major attack.
on three.
one, two, three.
shoot them!
detective stark?
excuse me.
yeah.
that guy over there.
and you pulled himself off on the 00th?
am i under oath?
i'd appreciate it if you'd stop asking that
was mr. young the one you pulled over on the 00th?
i can't see it if you don't say it again
what?
you know what this is, you son of a bitch?
it wasn't a real bomb
"no blood, no crime."
not legally, detective.
even the threat to the bomb is a clear physical threat.
a terrible mistake.
i think what's terrible is your shirt.
your honor, we request the dismissal of the case.
liz, i don't know what to say.
he's your partner, jack.
that's not good enough, jack.
we've been trying to catch wayne young for years.
liz, i'm
jack, what are you gonna say?
i need to be alone.
you want some chips?
no, i don't want chips, dan.
i think they put spice in it.
it feels better.
you've ruined the case, dan
but it's a state case
you mean your ex-boyfriend's case?
they're finishing the investigation.
that means no more department resources.
department revenue?
and fight crime with sticks?
a research requires financial resources.
i'll tell you what.
good luck to you.
you'll see.
good day to all of you.
see you in hell.
here it is.
i thought you might remember that.
you're absolutely right.
hey, do you have any nicotine gum with you?
i can't think of myself without them
because i left those cancer sticks.
that's it.
all right, we need to do a few errands.
first, i gotta get myself a shotgun.
you got it wrong!
there's a misunderstanding!
please!
i made a deal while you were in jail.
it's true for both of us.
what kind of deal?
heroin.
near south america.
i put it in one of our trucks.
i have a client.
and that's just the beginning
if he does business, we bring more heroin.
wayne, we're so close!
you meet the man and we make a delivery.
what about the cops?
they can't come after you after the border!
cops can't do anything!
rough day?
yeah.
is it about the girl or the job?
you're gonna need a second donut.
hey, dan.
what's up?
of course, yes.
i'll bring it up to liz in the morning.
i'll call you back.
don't move!
okay.
okay.
don't move!
i'm not moving!
why are you attacking me?
you're hurting the sacred bond.
there are three warrants on me.
being with the cops isn't the first thing to do
that's what i want to talk to you about.
how would you feel if the warrant was removed?
when you say "don't be distra
"julius, you don't have to go to jail, " you're not
'cause that's what
i'm all yours, man.
you can do what you want to me.
i want to know about wayne young.
i know that.
i know wayne young.
what do you want?
all i want is a piece of paper, a piece of paper, a pen and
do it.
he's got a place in oakwood, okay?
that's it.
does that make us good?
we're gonna put him in jail
we're fine.
okay.
because i want to hug you.
you can embrace it.
all right.
thank you very much, man.
okay.
okay.
what can i do for you, jack?
i was talking to dan...
it means everything is in the book...
it's not exactly your partner's
actually, that's why i can send her home.
don't worry about it
just let me know how to resist wayne.
okay.
i'll see you at the office at 0:00.
wayne worked in a garage in east dallas.
he works for a company like shell.
but what are we gonna arrest him for?
we'll figure something out when we get there.
no, dan.
we'll do a "first research."
yeah, that'll work.
by the way...
how did you know where wayne was doing?
am i still under oath?
this is the address.
hello!
it's weird
what did you say we'd go in and check out the truck?
what about this one?
we're gonna fight back without permission?
they should know that security is terrible.
besides, nobody gets in here without a helmet.
you mean us?
hey, it's a violation of
it's good after we spend more than $0.00.
that's why it works for
law is like a woman
it pisses you off, but it won't do anything to calm you down
everything gets worse.
what is this place?
what are they doing here?
we don't know...
i have to call liz.
it's
dan, what are you doing?
dan, we can't be here.
what you did was illegal, dan?
okay?
this truck is full of boxes.
yeah.
boxes full of crime.
come on.
we're over a 00-foot thing.
i can feel the whining in my back!
another excuse for the report.
listen, dan.
we had a bad start here, okay?
did you hear anything?
start the car.
i'll close the back.
dan, this is an illegal investigation, okay?
if we get caught, we're in big trouble!
your phone's ringing.
oh, my god
i hate this.
hello.
hello, detective dan.
it's julius, man.
how's our parole deal going?
hey, i can't talk
i'm behind wayne young's truck.
it's a
there's a man with a big
caesar has the right to caesar, paco.
looks like things are going well.
you're glad you didn't blow my head off with a shotgun, aren
it was just a little misunderstanding, wasn't
yeah.
let's make some money.
yeah, me, too.
damn it!
what the hell is that?
thanks for coming.
i'm dying slow.
you look good.
i'm not okay.
you know my parole.
the cop i made the deal with was trapped in one of wayne young's trucks.
there's no truck in there!
i mean, i have a girlfriend in jamaica.
maybe he'll come back here and open a motel
but why am i here?
you'll introduce me to wayne young.
you're friends, he's...
that's a very deeply meaningful word
we're more like colleagues, man.
sometimes she'd want me to take weed to the north, that's all.
skeeter, dear...
you got to find this truck, and you got to find it now, man.
look, i'll give you $000.
he's a monster, man!
he used to cut a man's head finger off!
her fingers were like lost!
that's disgusting, dude!
i love this car.
including the sound system?
what about the hubcaps?
you can have them, too.
you can have the ashtray, skeeter.
just find the truck for me, okay?
all right, i'll help you find the truck.
i didn't mean to yell at you.
there's the real joke.
they won't review the whole cargo.
what the hell was that?
don't panic
dan, this is texas, okay?
you just described 00,000 square miles of square miles.
damn it!
then let's break the door so we can jump out.
what's wrong with what?
physics, dan.
it's suicide.
not suicide if you jump fast enough, man.
we'll reset the speed of the truck.
come on.
why are you acting like something bad?
we got wayne young right where we want him.
yeah.
there's a two-blonded car on the way to
exactly.
this is detective jack bailey.
please leave a message, i'll call you back.
well, it's been 00 minutes
congratulations.
you're officially going the same way as your partner.
still waiting for your girlfriend?
detective bailey's not my girlfriend.
jack.
wherever you are, i hope you're having fun.
all i know is they're somewhere south.
how are you?
thank you very much
man, what took you so long?
dude, you asked me to find a criminal, didn't you?
can we just focus, please?
where's the truck with the police?
that way.
so i'm just going this way?
what's gonna happen on
i'm working on the ropes.
dude, are you
i think he had a deal with a man.
dude, you're gonna kill me
you'll definitely kill me.
do you know anything else?
i heard he had a frightening look.
and he's not from this country
we can make the deal on thursday.
i'm not british.
i'm from south africa.
yeah, there's a giraffe in south africa
see you thursday.
that's it.
coming with you wasn't part of our agreement.
hey.
do you want my car or not?
yes, i do.
that's what i thought.
thank you.
good night.
you have interesting friends, man.
he was wearing these weird boots, man.
i have those boots!
yeah.
what else was i supposed to do?
we're partners, right?
you would have done the same for me.
any more deals?
is there anything i should know?
that's it.
dan, what are you doing?
good luck.
i'll take care of it in
what are you doing?
don't i look like someone trying not to go crazy?
apparently.
i haven't opened them all yet.
you're looking for the scent?
let me ask you something, dan.
like i said, these boxes are full of crime.
yeah...
are you thinking about helping?
this has got to be a little more enlightening
the mystical sunrise.
it's
i like that.
don't die on me, dan.
don't die on me, dan.
don't die on me, dan.
hey, man, would you shut up?
i'm trying to talk on the phone!
yeah.
sort of.
in lubbock, "lill's an antique shop."
i don't know, man
it's like a souvenir shop.
besides... also
oh, my god
i've learned some information about the south american guy.
perfect.
just focus on where the deal is made.
save the moustache.
save the moustache.
the smell of candles is starting to drown me
they smell like mystic sunrise.
i think i'm gonna puke
i'll light more candles if you puke.
no.
give me that.
at least 0 pounds.
heroin.
it's heroin.
high purity.
small particles.
it's probably asian
wow, you know a lot about heroin.
thank you.
so you're saying you planned this?
i mean, being a cop is a team
you and me, jack.
that's how we ended it together.
are you serious?
we say, "catch this and catch it again."
bad cops chase only criminals with guns on their own.
good cops chase criminals with guns in a suit.
thank you for the career advice.
hey, listen, dan... dan...
what?
the truck's stopping.
why did we get here so early?
what kind of problem did you pick a place like this?
this little town is in full states.
i mean, it's about 000 miles to the nearest
we don't need to get caught
we're not even here.
just in case.
hello.
don't worry about gunmen.
mikkel likes to carry heavy weapons just in case it doesn'
i'm not worried.
it's so good to see you.
looks like we're doing a little business.
put the shotgun down.
on your knees.
excuse me?
i said, "get down on your feet."
hey, hey, hey, cowboy.
what you did here...
what the hell is going on here?
i'm sorry, wayne.
i made a deal, you son of a bitch!
everybody wins.
absolutely.
what?
okay.
okay.
no confusion.
how was the meeting?
they're both incredible.
we'd better get them both shot and get the goods.
cunning son of a bitch.
i should have killed you when i had the chance.
enough!
let's finish this now.
get your heroin in here and get out.
open the truck.
did you smell that?
come on!
come on!
remember, stick to the plan.
it's just
we'll face unexpected elements.
we will neutralize them with a major attack.
come on!
what the hell?
do you have a plan "b"?
let's go,
shoot them!
traitor, you cunning son of a bitch
i don't like the plan "b"!
it's a little early for you to come here, isn
i heard about the dan stark interview.
what is it?
it's about detective bailey.
she's usually in hot places.
i found an address on jack's desk last night...
hey!
we had a deal!
good day.
looks like you're in some trouble.
not as much as it looks
i think we're safe for now.
don't ever say we're safe again!
let's go!
who are these guys?
i don't know, and i don't
just kill them and get me the heroin.
cover me.
i'll call the lieutenant and call for backup.
lieutenant ruiz.
yes, lieutenant!
this is detective bailey!
you haven't checked in for the past six hours
where the hell are you?
it's a long story, ok
detective stark and i need backup.
send as many people as you can to code 0!
"lill is an antique shop." it's uncle.
00 minutes from lubbock.
all right, we're under heavy fire!
that's two hours away, detective.
what the hell are you doing there?
it's a
just send as many men as you can, okay?
we're too late, man.
we're too late.
this stupid deal happened five minutes ago.
where's the address
there must be somewhere around here.
man, come on.
is this it?
yeah.
it's back
we just passed.
it's not a safe way to drive!
then you can talk about my driving.
backup comes in 00 minutes.
that sounds about right.
we need to get the bad guys to the backup team
we'll meet the cavalry on the road.
good idea, dan.
he's right in
look!
if we're gonna die, this must be in a real car!
are you ready?
i'm waiting for you to say, "let's go
let's go!
get in the car!
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
don't you know how to make contact?
what did they teach you at the academy?
go!
go, go, go, go!
son of a bitch
you!
can't you make it go faster?
she had a good engine!
this car is dead!
maybe we should have taken sedan.
you want some?
dan, when did you get that chocolate?
i went back to the store when you were on the phone.
almond nutcracked... almond
son of a bitch
i want that heroin!
i don't think it's such a good situation
what, you don't think i've already noticed?
take it!
come on.
come on!
hang on.
nice!
that's exactly what i wanted it to be.
that's what scared me.
no movement.
i think we're totally safe now.
do you see what i see?
looks like a flaming truck.
i got it!
i dropped it!
get down!
are you okay?
yeah, i'm fine.
but i was just better.
yeah.
bastard!
i got it!
he's running off with heroin.
jack.
partner, we got a bigger problem.
put your guns down.
where's the heroin?
you're lying!
he's not l
we left her in the middle of the road.
"paco" took her and ran away.
who are you?
what were you doing behind the truck?
we're police officers.
are you a cop?
are you kidding me?
i'm not.
julius!
you did it!
i'll explain later.
can i hug you?
yes, you can.
come on!
okay.
you'd better get out of here.
get your gun registered!
what was that all about?
we hugged.
i'm a hugger.
it was like a walnut trunk number 00.
anyway, he ran over here...
no sign of paco.
what about heroin?
no sign of him either.
looks like he took her and ran away.
she has no witnesses.
and wayne young will testify against paco.
and i'm sure that's exactly what he'
"i'm gonna drag that little cunning to hell with me."
well, that'll do.
yeah, but you know what's not gonna work?
i didn't want to get involved in something like this.
it just happened.
you came all this way because you're worried about me?
no.
i came all this way to see wayne young get arrested.
i'm so sorry, jack.
well, i stole a sports car and set the truck on fire.
did you think about that on your apology?
we're questioning the south african guy.
did you know the giraffes lived there?
it's been a
we stole dan's pure heroin, okay?
it's hard to accept as victory.
i can't say we lost. "
what do you mean?
don't ever say we're safe again!
cover me.
i'll call the lieutenant and call for backup.
yes, lieutenant!
this is detective bailey.
it's a long story, ok
send as many people as you can to code 0!
hey, old man...
sorry about the shooting.
how much is this door lock?
five dollars.
that's a brick.
that's hand-pain
i'll give you three b
okay.
here you go.
three dollars.
how much for a chocolate chip?
it's 00 cent
why would i do that?
i was hungry.
i'm not saying chocolate.
what made you change the packages?
well, you said everything would be in the book, right?
yeah.
exactly.
i'm not wasting your time.
i brought you the best stuff.
that's the best heroin money can buy.
it's easily worth $000,000.
it's a wholesale
here.
"the alamo memorial"?
well, listen.
stop.
wayne young was captured within 00 hours and...
it's all $0
actually, it's
all i have to do is...
like i said, being a cop is a team thing.
but most of it is like the desert of water, there is
hunters here spend their lives searching for rare and difficult prey.
000 tons of weight is the biggest animal that's ever lived with 00 meters long.
despite their great size, the blue whales are the most aerodynamics and energy-deprived within all swim animals.
they can travel over 000 miles a day for weeks and weeks.
it takes a lot of effort to open your giant mouth, so that only makes it when you see a lot of rich and busy krill.
here, feeding opportunities are often rare.
when it's all over, the hunters must continue their constant search.
frigate birds are pirates of the high seas.
frigates must be very light, because they can't have heavy grease that don't water the feathers of other sea birds.
little fish try to hide in the ocean between the only sheltered dead waves.
with the extra thrust in their tails, the flying fish can take off more than once.
with a good wind, they can float hundreds of metres.
all the open ocean hunters can't go for food.
she can barely swim.
this dark seaweed has to lie in an ambush between the moss.
in this very unique creativity in this ocean, these blankets will see a lot of demand for young fish that want
it's finally the first opportunity in weeks.
only a few inches from his prey can make a move.
trusting his perfect camouflage and hiding in the seaweed.
the oceans are so vast that some hunters can only find enough prey searching for themselves as a team.
dolphins live in highly advanced social groups.
they can work together and cover a large area of the ocean.
small groups sometimes come together to form 0,000 super-pods.
they use a type of "exolocation" to find their prey.
but these little fish spend most of their time in the deep ocean, where dolphins can't reach them.
they only hunt when they go up to the surface to feed.
when they find a lot of them, dolphins use their radar for another purpose.
as the dolphins feed, they're coming down from the bottom of the herd to stop their prey from escaping to the
as we go down, food is scarier than on the surface, so hunters have to do everything in their power to protect their precious energy.
most of them are just drifting through the tentacles of lethal injections.
the others are slowly heading towards the dark with the power to push the feathers of their imagination.
beroe is the greatest jelly predator in deep waters.
beroe has special jelatinous fly inside her mouth to catch her jelatinous prey.
this deep-water squid, using long, sticky tentacles to hunt.
the ocean may be a wide blue desert, but like every desert, there are savages.
the sea stretches the direction of the deep ocean currents upwards and forcing nutrient water to the surface.
success here depends on sensitive maneuvers.
hiding his prey in a flat sight, giving his prey a false confidence.
the lions of the lion fish are visually confusing, so it's hard to predict how close he is to his prey.
and the extravagant fins she used to hide her demanding tail movements are making her superior.
these deep water currents that provide a lot of residents also attract visitors to these savages.
they travel hundreds of miles of miles between the sea mountains they use as a point of gathering in the open ocean.
both shark species of galapagos and other isolated sea mounts east of the great ocean.
no one knows why they've gathered so many, but some certainly come to seek food for these savages.
if these little fish stay close to the deck, sharks can't reach them.
as long as they keep the silverfish near the ocean floor, their predators can get rid of their head.
there's never an easy lunch in the open
here, the storms have been exposed to the storm, carrying nutrients to the surface, creating isolated areas.
black browed albatross are the same size as frigate birds, but three times more heavy, so he needs a totally different flying style.
albatross has the longest wingspan of bird, and that enables the southern ocean winds to exploit its power.
first, they glide against the wind and use its energy to lift up its energy.
then they'll turn around and dig down the wind, and they
they spend weeks at sea searching for prey, never returning to the land.
since the winds are so strong here, albatrosses can't afford the weight of the fat that makes their feathers waterproof.
they can dive like a duck to a meter, so they connect the south polo sea stealing to their prey into range.
like all birds, albatrosses have to lay eggs on land, but there are very few islands in the south atlas ocean, very crowded.
about half a million albatross are coming here every year to raise their babies.
adults share parenting duties, coming back to feed their babies every few days.
when the feeding process is over, it's time to hit the
the albatross are so heavy, they can only fly from places where the wind is strong enough.
from the air, the ocean may seem unique, but under the surface, there are strong currents that are constantly in motion.
these currents are more effective than all the other powers to determine the distribution of life here.
all the organisms that drift in the ocean are bound by their flow.
they come together to feed on the fresh plankton that the floating little plant and animals and the current brings in.
the feathers on their legs slow down their drop, and in the battery, they swam upward, with a few tails, and they're still feeding
the currents that carry these traveling crabs are also the bus function for the ocean's predators.
with their flawless aerodynamics, they can travel the longest distances with minimum effort.
these hunters often gather around the oceans of the ocean currents.
every predator has a sense of smell that can detect certain unpredictable traces of prey.
big shoals of fish are attracted to plankton bolts.
a bunch of sardine miles can be long.
self-defense depends on my description.
when the attack arrives, the sardines act like one body.
every fish instantly fits the movement of their neighbour's movements, and the whole herd moves in full-time.
even when more sea lions arrive, they don't seem to break the sardines' coordinated defenses.
the size of sea lions should be divided into smaller control groups.
but with so little predators, the fish still have the advantage.
all the sea lions can do is keep the sardines on the surface and wait for others to join them.
tuna attack from below, so the sardines can cut off their way to the deep waters.
as the fish tighten the nets, their pack of strategies make it easier for the hunters.
tons of sardine are running out in less than an hour.
once again, predators disappear into the blue, going their own path.
this blue whale is still searching for food to satisfy her hunger.
since he's so big, he has to find an average 0 ton of food
they're trapped in the surface because of fish.
this blue whale has finally found what he's been looking for for for
a meal big enough to open your big mouth.
the krill is hundreds of metres long and clustered to bottom.
the whale is heading in the line of the hunt, targeting the most intense part of
swimming with a fully-developed throat, it takes too much effort to have the whale thrust.
the whale uses his tongue to throw it out of his mouth and collects the criss in his jaws.
but it takes time to drain all that water.
the blue whales may not be as agile as the other hunters, but they don't have to
no other predator is more qualified to exploit the messed-up riches that the oceans provide.
the blue whale is the greatest hunter of all oceans in the
the oceans have created a lot of difficulty with the "w" team.
it's been a two-year mission to accomplish
the crew worked with john calamokokidis, the world's most important blue whale expert in the
john received vital information from these harmless tags.
part of this research and part of the reason that we're working with filmmakers is that this gives us a unique chance to acquire scientific data.
that's why we're doing this because of our research permit to get an idea of what they're doing underwater, how they dive, how they're feeding.
the team's success will depend on good water visibility.
she's very lazy and the whale is literally disappearing in the darkness
we couldn't
the first year was badly affected by the vulnerability of the weak visibility and the film ended in
second year sea conditions are better.
before the blue whales dive in 00 minutes, they only come up to the surface every 0 or 0 minutes.
he's got to try to get the boat ahead of the whale, but he's
then he'd have to hope that david's going into the water and that whale's gonna be close enough to get a
this year's water is completely clean this year, but it still takes time to keep david in a good position.
after weeks of effort, eventually, all the elements are coming together and giving david the chance of his life.
it was heavy before me, it took too long.
i mean, it was too big, like a freight train.
the blue whales underwater are rare, so it's a tremendous success to record a simply floating whale.
this series is all about hunting, although it's been a nice shot, but we need to get a shot of the blue whales eating the episode.
and we have to wait for the krill to go up to the surface.
once a month, maybe twice.
the crew hit a promising field, but it's quite an unpleasant source.
look at those birds in the water!
we'll go check it out.
look at this majesty!
i'm still not quite sure what i saw.
david saw him, he turned the camera.
he took a turn, he went up and took a big bite.
they call them blue whales because you see them underwater, bright, burning cobalt blue, they come out of the blue of the ocean.
i was upstairs trying to get another image of the krill, and, honestly, it appeared once again, one more time in the mouth.
it probably took less than ten minutes, but without discussion, no doubt, it was the most amazing thing i've ever seen without question.
sharing the water with a blue whale and eyeing the water is never something i'll never forget.
and the opposite turn.
yeah, it's a unique perspective we'll never see.
thanks to this close cooperation, the team filmed blue whales as they've never been seen before... and finally uncovered the secret life of the greatest hunter in the ocean.
you like him!
no, i don't.
every friend i meet without exception is attracted to him.
isn't it sad?
when mia went away as a exchange student, we made a list of our pros and cons, and it helped clear our feelings.
yeah, ethan karamakov...
abigail sent a list of pros and cons to the entire school.
look, i'm coming to stay with you for a while.
no, i'm not gonna get you in trouble.
i won't stay forever.
okay.
double battement frappé.
and petit battement.
everyone thinks the farm is a dangerous place.
relieve.
i know every rabbit hole, broken fence, rusty nail.
and nice arm wrists.
no matter where i am, i'm safe.
your wife's in, tara
and blance.
everybody, come out.
tara, you can join us.
but the academy is a completely different world.
if you think you know your way, think about it again.
you'll notice you're actually in a minefield.
i see a new trap everywhere i turn...
"it smells like christmas...
"it's her way of e
"everything she talks about is true."
could it have been worse?
yeah, well, since you asked...
at least i'm not the first minus on your list.
i guess i should be grateful for that.
i'm really sorry, kat.
i didn't mean to involve you in my confusion.
believe me, i tried so hard not to feel like this.
here's a good reason.
my brother will break your heart, and when he does, i won't be there to fix the pieces.
i promise i'll stay away from her.
do you think abigail sent it to third grade?
ethan did.
kill me.
yes, a question for you.
who can tell me the real meaning of "pas de deux deux"?
pas de de de deux.
it means a matching dance.
but what does it mean beyond words in french, metaphorically?
pas de de de deux.
two bodies, one soul.
a man and a woman danced with the same emotions.
that's what today's class is
i've never danced with a man before.
that's right.
at home, girls danced with girls.
there were no guys
it's just the cutest creatures that smash the fingers in
pas de de deux has three important rules.
trust.
throw it on some
unity.
great wonder wonder
and, most importantly, communication.
without these, yes...
ethan, isabelle, it's very nice of you to
remember, to be together, you have to trust and communicate.
do your hands always stick like this?
i'm allergic to you.
focus on who you're dancing with.
no one else should be important.
you want to drop it?
relax.
you're doing fine.
what great class was that?
i mean, patrick's such a great teacher.
don't you think the universe is trying to put us together?
la-la-la-la-la-la.
before we left, we talked with miss raine that you won't do any lessons for the rest of your days
don't get excited now.
instead, you're gonna practice for me.
don't forget, as in your other classes, you will be judged without this exercise.
this is a blow!
i'm gonna be walking a dog with eyes closed.
at least you don't have to spend 00 hours with abigail like me.
i'd rather cut my eyes with a blind knife.
i know we'll ask our wives 00 questions in 00 hours.
is that it?
"you can ask any questions any of each of you can ask
"but you must answer honestly."
like i want to know something about christian.
so you're not alone.
i don't have my favorite food pizza, lucky number, and we're done.
i know all about you.
your whole school is being broadcast live.
where are you going?
the beach.
i love this city.
i want to check in.
i'm going to find christian.
we'll be here, checking out the pretty girls.
great!
oh, i'm starting to like this assignment.
are you like a hunter or something?
so where did you grow up?
a suburban.
by the beach?
you're lucky
you think i'm rich?
do you have a brother or a sister?
he lives in broken hill.
i mean, are you emotionally close?
i mean, the room is made of meat and blood.
she's doing something.
you have to answer.
says who?
rules.
how far did you go with a man?
there's a phase one.
and there's second base.
anybody ever come into your city?
have you ever kissed a man?
you didn't kiss, did you?
maybe i can help you.
maybe you can get lost in front of me.
hey, i had more questions to ask.
and i'm trying to strengthen my stomach.
we can do this on the beach.
i won't come to the beach
are you allergic to fresh air?
i don't like the sand, i don't like salt, and i don't like the sun.
great.
i have to drink water.
me, too.
we hate you enough to ask you to die of thirst.
i don't care what her favorite color or her family does.
so did he say anything to you?
he did it!
"oh, let's go to the beach to do homework.
"it'll be so much fun!"
i didn't know she was gonna be
really.
what are you doing here?
we come to ourselves as third grade.
you're not supposed to be nagging here right now.
you can play with us if you want.
i may be blinded, but i'm not
come on, it's just football.
whoo!
are you coming, tara?
i think i'm staying.
i haven't finished my homework with christian yet.
come on, we're getting out of here
you know, in this scenario, including script in toilets.
you can hold on.
no, i can't hold it for 00 hours
i'm starving.
yeah, me, too.
i'm gonna
i'm gonna go get some food.
this place is closed against smoking.
find another bathroom.
why do men have to stink so badly?
why do you have to be so bad?
it's true.
they stink.
what you did was crime and more than enough.
just think about it, and we'll both be done quick before he dies of oxygen.
i can't, can you please humor a song or something like that?
hurry up.
i still don't understand why you sent that list to everyone.
you're as uncomfortable as a mumbling mosquito.
it just made you look bad.
okay, don't say anything.
there you go.
hey, where's tara
i don't know.
huh.
whoa!
hey, babe
there's plenty of room in my lap.
hey!
i wrote this, princess!
come on, we'll catch them later.
you want to die?
didn't you see what they were trying to do to me?
you can't fight around here.
anyway, what are you still doing here?
if you wanted to know, i was waiting for the bus.
why did you see me in a limousine?
you don't know anything about me.
i don't think i want to know either.
i've never met anyone as rude as you.
didn't your mother teach you manners?
he's dead
look, if you're worried, all you have to do is call.
who said i was curious?
i'm just checking my messages.
what do you know?
i can understand everything.
this whole communication thing must be working.
is that so?
can you see this?
ow.
i can't imagine what it's like to lose your mother.
no, you can't.
was she dancing?
yeah, when he was young.
is that why you wanted to go to the academy?
you're leaving?
i won't.
i don't believe you.
i saw how you dance!
that's
he lives in broken hill.
very good.
and say i'm in trouble.
i don't know, probably
you said you were close.
so you're saying he answered, right?
brothers help their brothers?
maybe until i call her.
the room only calls for another number, so he doesn't know it was me.
now you know everything.
is that true or wrong?
i'd like to say it's wrong
see, you've learned nothing.
my brother and i are very close.
i have one question left.
question 00.
ask him.
why did you tell everyone i was dressed in the wrong locker room?
you knew it was a mistake.
why would i even bother?
i don't believe you still lie about it.
i know you did it.
you know, i wasn't the only guy there.
have you thought about that?
tara, what were you thinking?
you don't think he's
do you think it says here 0-0 or 00?
it says two and four hours.
you want to know why i'm bad against tara?
because you three are so stupid!
i need to talk to you.
like you don't know.
you've been laughing behind me all this time, haven't
excuse me?
at the beginning of the audition week... you told everyone i was in the wrong locker room.
it was you, wasn't it
come on, admit it was a funny thing.
and leave me alone on the beach?
it's fun, right?
but you weren't with us.
not answering my pros and cons list?
i didn't realize i had to answer.
of course you were supposed to.
the whole school is laughing at me because of
why should it be because of me?
look, if you want to hear the truth, i'm ashamed of that list.
i mean, we only talked to you three or four times, right?
and you went and wrote down everything you felt and sent it to the whole school.
i don't even know you.
tara?
tara?
she can't talk to you.
yes, he can.
i thought you were sick of girls coming to you after ethan.
because i hate seeing my friends sad.
growing up, my parents warned me of all dangers.
we have to figure it all out here ourselves...
prove to me yesterday's assignment wasn't a waste of
nice work, boys.
whether we like it or not, we're tied with ropes that will never be broken for the next year.
so we have a long way ahead of us.
good morning.
good morning, bette.
uh-huh.
come on, get dressed.
i want to be there when they open it.
okay.
i already threw a candy.
just one.
take your napkin.
you want butter?
here you go.
good morning.
be careful.
the inspector's
good morning, mrs. tremont.
good morning, mr. korman.
mr. tremont.
hey.
yeah.
what can i do for you, mrs. tremont?
it says here the pork chops are sold.
that's all you've seen in the commercial.
how about those pork chops?
we're not selling them.
the ad just says pork chops, mr. korman.
they don't have pictures or id numbers.
so what do you want, mrs. tremont?
i want these ribs at that price.
you got it.
jake.
hey!
jake.
uh...
first of all, i'm sorry that this is up to you, john, but we have a personnel problem you should know about.
this guy we're gonna get doesn't decide between us and goldman.
i know you hate this, but you have to step in here and use your magic wand.
is the guy that good?
let's not kidnap this guy
these guys from work school think their value is $000,000 when they work a week.
i hate these attitudes.
okay, arrange it with kathy for the weekend.
i wrote notes for the next days.
the vale project has given us a lot of directions, but management is resisting our suggestions that we should provide information as to why investors are so profitable.
they don't want to give so much information to their compet
i don't know why we should cooperate with this vale guy.
he's a dark
we're risking the company's reputation.
if we refuse him, we'll never get a job from him
he's demanding a huge fee and the banking division wants it.
i'm worried about my wife cut this year.
lower the price.
i think it's the earlyest concern that's ever recorded on the profit bill.
yes?
your sister's on the line, mr. tremont.
he says it's important.
she needs to talk to you right now.
i'm in a
john, this is about our mother.
she had a heart attack
she's fine now, but she's
can you come?
hey!
how was the flight?
it was good.
the guy next to me didn't leave me alone.
he heard i was on wall street, so don't ask.
"how's this stock stuff?
i see.
have you ever heard of a stock called chrometex?
mario.
i mean, someone mentioned the math department.
they're generating heat sensors for the low-grade capsules.
it's gonna be bigger
it won't
no?
no.
good.
she's at home with your d
home or hospital first?
it doesn't matter
let's go to the hospital.
that's what i thought.
how's dad
to be honest, johnny, he's a little shook
that's why annie's staying
she doesn't want him to be alone
how's mom doing?
how serious is she?
she can't admit she's really had a heart
he's lying there because of a heart attack, and he's claiming that he's indigest
she blames me.
what do you mean?
he says it's because of the sausages i made for dinner.
he claims i tried to kill him.
did you do it?
no jury can blame me, john.
i believe you.
if you're here, i'm a very sick man.
look, mom, that's why you're the best.
in your case, not many people would feel guilty.
how are you?
do you have any pain?
i'm alive because of my will.
she'll tell you.
i have the will of a woman half my age.
don't throw yourself in the
have you seen your father?
yo, i came straight from the airport.
if you see him, don't say anything about a heart attack
just tell me something's wrong with me.
okay?
mom.
listen to me.
just tell him something was wrong with me.
she'll think i'm sleeping because she's taken my womb.
okay.
if you have to eat outside, go to mcdonald's or wendy's.
somewhere simple.
mom, you shouldn't worry about my dad right now.
i think you should think about yourself right now.
you had a heart attack.
i'm not sure i had a heart attack.
it pains me more like gas pains.
mom, if it was gas pains, they'd give you acid pills.
they wouldn't tie you to $00 million worth of machines.
did you see the doctor who took care of me?
because i don't believe he's a real doctor.
he was wearing tight pants with a big, silver belt buckle.
she can't be more than 00 years
they're graduating from medical school these days.
john!
god, it's so good to see you.
you came and saw your mother first, huh?
yeah.
how she looked at you, john, tell me the truth.
like my mother.
it was like dragging the serum bottles out of there.
i mean, it's just gas pains.
i'm sure that's what she told
and the willpower?
like a woman half-year-old.
