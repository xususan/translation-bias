michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, he shared his bed with his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think you and i are fit together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i will.
i need to write a 000-word essay about the moral side of the war and the advancement of a conflict.
i'm not sure our ethics teacher would like me to cheat when i'm writing a test.
so, you passed my ethics test.
in fact,georgemichael was desperately burned to her teacher, the ethics teacher at bethbaerly.
small crimes can be slaughtered even the hands of people who commit little crimes.
no ring ring ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
g.d.k.'s eye was upon us.
your father thought it would make us look more charitable.
he must have imitated my signature.
'maybe a year ago,'i'll have a son... who'd finished the sinking cheese!
you have to get me out of this.
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't take care of her
and i don't have a mother's compassion and milk any
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm giving you an olive branch here.
yes-yes.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
meanwhile, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
why am i telling you this?
i guess there's some things that you can't tell your father
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set up his teacher's dad... to help him do his maternal duty.
there's nothing wrong with that.
however, i must say that i'm a little hurt that you don't think about it.
and the aunts can do this.
teachers can do that too.
sure, someday, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay's never been so proud of what she said all her life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i keep telling you about.
she's really... a young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma," you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache
yeah.
but gob mistook michael's affection for decency, and he felt like he was fighting to get involved.
because, you know, beyond adorability... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
_
and george sr. was about to come to a surprise visit.
i've read all your teachings and bought all your tapes.
and i watched it all over again.
george sr. had recently sold a series of tapes he had recently offered to people... to make money for his new spirituality.
i also lost two pounds by eating your banana bluth jail bars.
i'm here to find out where
this is a nice place to start.
and after michael got rid of the two girls he'd made a date with, lindsay met at the parent-teacher night.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this bedroom have the same floor plan as our kitchen?
i think he's very fit for you.
i thought this would help you get the concept of motherhood out of your head.
besides, i can't hurry up and marry someone just because my son wants to.
i'm mrs. baerly, the ethics
my goal is to make my students appreciate the importance of life... that could be the result of an unthinkingly triggered
and michael began to know his son's ethics teacher.
and that's the "rrrrrr" part of
you know, it's very annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were joking.
no, i was just laughing because you were laughing.
"rrrr!" - "rrrrr!" - "r
but, you know, i'm gonna
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a moral question for you.
can a parent teacher invite her to have a drink?
or... or...
yeah, he's dead
i think that mr. daniels having a stroke with...
let's go get a drink.
yeah, maybe it will help.
george sr. was dealing with his own admirer.
i've already told you many of my sins.
maybe you could tell me a few sins.
well, there are legal indicators that show my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me about one of those things that happened... again at the university dorm.
and what's his meeting with mrs. bayerly, the second date today...
michael, this little korean has come, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think that's him.
you're gonna have to peel her to freeze to say something
yes, mama.
they'll take her back.
don't take your shoes off, little man!
don't take your shoes off!
he's out of
who is it?
this "annong" is your father and i have adopted.
what, i'm leaving for a few days and you find a new son?
lucille buster realized she was worried, even jealous.
and she understood how it felt to be ignored.
annyong is your brother now, anny
cancel it.
it stays.
listen, i'll call you sonar again.
nice driving.
are you making dinner reservations?
a "little korean" did it.
and after the meetings...
michael's been a step he hasn't
well, do you think this is a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we get inside without waking everyone up?
this may not be my best idea so far.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i loved.
and i took someone you liked.
i'm like, "nashbaggerbagerlajam
listen, i know you're trying to get revenge on marta case.
i was lying to you when i said i wouldn't try to sleep with her, so...
he has to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
that's
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
seriously, i had a chance to get rid of him.
it's ok
very romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden"?
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but first, i don't know it was real.
but now, your... moral teacher...
yeah, i did that for him.
oh.
he loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, as a matter of fact, i'm sure you're interested in her.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
is this about your class?
i mean, she loved him... that he loved
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was she doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with her.
well, why would he do that?
why did he sleep with my ethics teacher?
you and i know that, but gob just...
he's not one of the good shooters that targeted his target, and he's almost everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
she's been accompanying the strange dance girls... and i thought i'd go see her and, uh, do, uh, do,
"hey, you want to dance?"
and that's what i thought was gonna happen, "what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it differently in the mirror, but...
but, you know, you know, we were dancing with a joke or something.
i didn't think so details.
don't you think you should go out with someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've taken a very difficult book to find a picture of saddam disappointment in a bathing suit.
"what would saddam do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's just like our fire escape.
in prison, george sr. was preparing for the evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon was making his own preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael is still angry with gob... and yet he went to find the family expert in making trouble.
i know you went out with shannon.
with that cheerleader?
yeah, she's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid different
i wish i had someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and i asked him... but he was breathing and he dropped the phone.
i never heard back.
you know, maybe we should both go together.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hello.
my mother took it.
he's making me tape him to school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss george michael's condition with mrs. bearly.
i'm sorry.
hey.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality...
you see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's like, she's in love with you, so
he knows we're leaving.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most unnatural thing i've ever heard.
well, you've only been an ethics teacher for half a
look, that was preemptive.
my brother was trying to sleep with you.
then i want to leave you right now and i'm not coming back to you.
i see.
from now on.
george sr. went for a walk with cindi.
george.
and she's getting to know him
you can totally spill your guts at me here.
it's weighting my soul
you, you,
she's picking up the camera
(i'm taking her to the grand dance, this is your dinner, so she's away with mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy
watch your back, my migrant little brother!
and spring dance was the last pace.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting her in because she doesn't have the perfect-shaped nose, circle-shaped eyes, the strong square jaw.
do you want to dance?
all right!
finally found shannon, gob called...
gobun found out he was cheating on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i ruined our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about this for a long time, and-and
that's... that's your right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing at a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yeah, my ethics teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
after being so mean to you, it really made me feel compelled to try to protect me.
in fact, gob confuses michael's ethics teacher... with his civics teacher.
man, he's got... the type.
gob, miss whitehead was a citizen tutor.
second movement.
i've been seeing mrs. baerly, and i should never have brought gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never wanted to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed at some sad things, but...
i don't think we're gonna have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm getting that cake.
hey, you want to dance?
i can't believe this is working.
the next arrested development.
buster's cheque would make him angry.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
no candles allowed here.
my mom's going crazy.
no, it's okay.
i'm burning my own candle.
yeah, that's what i'm gonna do
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you with these?
it's ok
right here, i'll help you.
these?
okay, here, let me carry it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
that's what you're suggesting, connie, it'
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die
we're all going one day, right?
four months ago, each of you attended an interview to join a never-before-seen tv show.
and guess what?
you win.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm totally gay, and i'm proud of
you're sweet, aren't you
i want to rule our country.
next question.

he doesn't know
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.

these days, barack looks like obama.
each of you will earn $00,000.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
damn it!
great.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know if this is a donkey joke?
that's
actually, it's our third show, but we're not gonna publish until the fall
you're gonna have to play and earn the money to see if this is a prank or not.
you will be asked to perform a series of tasks.
the missions will force your borders, your courage and your thought.
sounds like fun, doesn't it?
what kind of mission are they, man?
make your decision now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i didn't have a girlfriend to admit that even with her head
i have to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you guys are crazy.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
stick around.
you'll find out.
the total amount of money will be divided equally between the survivors, but if you all make it through the night, there's a rich reward for you.
no money can spend the night here for me.
does anyone else want to join her?
i'm not.
there's no way i'm going to the city with this
i'm in
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him
goodbye.
you're an idiot.
it's a damn party joke, they're gonna fuck you.
you don't look like a bunch of idiots.
don't you see this is a record party?
or we'll be famous.
there's a human head in there!
don't worry, it's not
it seemed pretty real to me.
that's why they call it special effects.
it's nice, isn
a little sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thank you to our award-winning special effects team.
follow me, fellas.
in the warm swamp water, lazy crocodiles are waiting for their prey.
the indian crocodiles are long and benign.
to such crocodiles...
guys.
i see you're working hard as usual.
are we ready?
we're all set
and absolutely.
keep it up.
yes, sir.
hey.
great job scaring them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are joining the show.
you seemed really scared.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really gives me the creeps when
did you know that?
the dead homeless?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
it must be a big coincidence.
do you really think it's safe there?
it's safe enough for the show to be insured.
any other questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're rolling.
each of you has been chosen by your own free will to spend the night in prison to earn $00,000.
it's clear enough, isn'
all right, let the party begin.
you can find everything you need in your base camp, that's the manager's office.
where is he
it's compl
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you've taken all our clothes, how can we write?
go down the hall, turn right again, left.
straight down the stairs, left, right, and one more left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
there you will find a key to get you out of your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought leaving the basement was terrible.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where is she going?
welcome to the mission.
can you not do that?
i don't see a damn thing here.
does anyone remember where we're going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, go straight, right twice, then left.
there's too many straight walks
no, go down the hall, straight down the hall,
"turn to the water, do it right again, and to the left
"then straight down the stairs, then straight down the st
"sola, right, and left again."
what are you?
smart.
_
careful.

oh, my god
what is this place?
and be ready.
it was fun.
let's speed them up a little
yes, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
damn it.
i don't
the power's running low, the generator should've come in.
damn it!

strange, isn't it?
be careful!

here we are.
we're here

i think he's the manager

okay, yeah.
look at this.
what's up, man?
"hello, brave contestants.
"welcome to warden clem harvis's office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room
"this chess stones will determine your personal role.
"you cannot change your stones with the other contestants.
"jillas were her favorite".
"now it's your turn to put your hand in the box."
oh, shit.
well, who wants first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't
what do you mean you don't know
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black fort.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
damn it!
that was really sick.
my little piggies, welcome to the task.
now let me tell you about the pennyville state prison.
in the time of crisis in 0000, when the cost was up, the ruthless warden decided to raise his fortune by destroying certain expenses.
these were their prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the director's crimes were released.
the last person here was sentenced to the death penalty was director harvis himself.
rumor has it that the manager's still walking down the halls.
tonight, you will be asked to face the principal and the tortured souls under this building.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
does anyone want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the prison church to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first hallway.
the sound job is awesome
thank you.
damn it!
what is it?
they turned off my flashlight.
i can't see anything.
okay, calm down, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung the babies!
their children... their
i think they've got it covered with speakers.
sounds are more effective than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
oh, my god
that sounds lovely.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't
there's a sound
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're calling me on speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off your flashlight.
all right, now?
open the bible to the marked page...
"you will find the lord's prayer there.
"00 years ago, the holy place was done with no respect for this place,
"now this is the room of unusual events."
oh, my... "in reverse."
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit
i can't do
"when you complete your mission...
"if there's no sign of the director,
you can go back to camp.
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry, whoever i'm bothering
that wasn't my idea.
okay.
"to protect us from evil...
"our father in the mountains...
"don't let evil lead us.
"to protect us from overcome...
"give us our debts, as we forgive those who owe us.
"and give us our daily bread today.
"as it is in heaven...
"as in the sky,
"for thy kingdom and dominion are yours."
please tell me i can go now.
"before you go to camp"
oh, my god, randall, you should blow out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit down there for a minute.
look what they're made for money
where'd she go?
i understand that the people who did this work cut our connection to our homo friend for a little while to give our homo friend a more scary weather.
whatever.
absolutely, she's gone in a j
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, man, it's not that bad.
it's definitely not worth the
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it
they can give you another assignment.
no kidding.
i swear you don't even know how you feel there.
it's like you're walking through a thick fog, just cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
yeah, she's right.
i want to go next.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated
we'll send scelzi downstairs and have her look, you'll fix it.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen
it's too
we need to talk.
i'm busy
we can either talk or i'll go or
it's important to me too, taylor
what do you mean?
i had a little research done.
by "do not disturb" you mean the local girl you slept with?
am i right?
big lips, wide hips, taylor.
okay, the prison isn't just for the
do the women have division?
and that damn crazy manager would go naked around the women's department and never answer anyone.
he beat them up, raped them, knocked them down, and starved them to death.
they say she's been feeding some of her own bab
what's that supposed to mean?
what do i mean?
this true story will increase interest in the show!
everyone could be talking about us.
it's nothing compared to the facts you made up.
i agree.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do that, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
is that so?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they are.
nice.
scelzi, what's that?
it's just a little something to get me through the night.
you want some?
just get your hairy ass over here, okay?
yes, captain.
hello?
you scared the shit out of me.
i've got a pretty good stuff
suit yourself.
we're all ready to begin.
i'd say my biggest fear was being buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will put you in the freedom zone".
okay,
i'm at the end of the freedom
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
damn it!
what?
blood.
it's not real
no cursing, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me you're upstairs, not down the stairs.
i'm sorry
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down there, you're gonna see a finger
he says...
damn it!
"welcome to cell number five.
"as we consider the violence and insanity,
oh, shit.
tell me what to do and i'll get out of this hell right now.
no!
thank you.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, "if a prisoner fails to commit suicide and fails to
"you will now live the penalty for a prisoner."
okay, where's the
under your foot.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult mission.
"you'll be told what you'll do when you'
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my job.
connie.
what?
check this out.
what?
oh, no...
you're fired.
why not?
you went behind my back, and i specifically told you, you added something to the show, and you're asking why you were fired?
this is not our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't
don't look at me.
look, connie, you gotta get that guy out, okay?
he's gonna fuck
damn it!
we'll be ruined.
so you didn't bring this?
not with a cut.
it's obvious
what's so obvious?
come closer.
i asked you why you put a camera in the control room.
yeah.
the camera back... they want to record the footage...
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
it's genius, isn
it's absolutely gen
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to film how he scares us by putting something into the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black king and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you could do another mission.
well, that's
okay, black king and white horse turn right and go to the gas chamber.
white queen and black horse go straight, and they go to prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"the hawk and the left first, turn right.
"rok and go to the end of the hallway,
"and come down the stairwell".
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, open it.
we're in.
"welcome to the gathering room.
there must be a light on the wall behind you, turn it on.
"black king and white horse enter the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
that place deserved the best, it was the real place.
it's the only place the legal department has
nice, isn't
it's pretty creepy
oh, my god
what's that smell?
a documented real death chamber is often carried by death's own smell.
of course, the smell isn't really
if a man knows that his life's last moments, his concern has come to the end, it'll cause an epidemic of smell.
in that case, the smell of the human smell we're breathing is the smell of the gas that killed him.
it's time for fun, ladies and
he's sitting in the black king's
black king?
that would be me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you will find some meat and a ceiling.
"you're gonna cook this meat and eat
man!
the prisoners are always nerd, pig...
"or there is no lamb and there is no lamb...
"that they suspected.
"they thought they'd never tasted before, that it's a nice
you're talking about human flesh, aren't you
are you inside?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i gave up.
you'll connect toni.
i'm transferring you from here, before toni's gas can be accelerated, the fear of the prisoners must be fully lived
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends had some weird desires.
are you okay?
okay.
"your mission is the gas teammate...
"to find the main valve and cut the gas before it kills the
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to throw up.
okay.
strange.
i can't do
i can't
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
no more prank.
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they'll pay extra money."

yeah, what was that?
oh, shit.

listen to me.
there's been a change of plans

the bbc can confirm that the american terrorist leader adem qasim has escaped from mi0 custody, one of the most serious mistakes in the history of the
the security convoy transporting qasim seems to have been attacked on the shelolt route.
you call it not war, because it's in the west streets.
because in new york, in washington, you didn't want that in london.
but the children of pakistan didn't want them either
when they get shot with drone airplanes, they call it murder.
qasim presents a new kind of threat.
so far, he hasn't targeted civil
our models show a 00% chance of an attack within 00 hours.
the more pressure he gets, the smaller the window.
i can't say that when i'm under tape tape
the secretary of state is coming tomorrow
we serve the british people, not washington.
if that's not true, we're already done.
the americans think we don't serve the purpose anymore.
we need a head.
i'll be off duty in the morning
you didn't hear anything about qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, what's gonna happen to me
you're out.
nobody else knows that qasim is in his web.
just get out.
will holloway?
go.
how's life after mi0?
you're not from the moscow division.
you need london.
is there anyone you should say goodbye to?
thank you.
we know about harry's connection to your family, so we understand this may not be easy for you.
even if he's dead, it'
harry's too arrogant to kill himself.
he was pretending to kill himself.
he went to this woman's grave
the love of your life
harry's team has noticed a change in harry's attitude since she died.
she's emotionally distant, she's cold, she's
water would be below 0 degrees.
she had hypothermia before she reached the bank.
this is the picture before you entered the land, and this is the picture you said it was taken after you jum
before she disappeared, harry made three encrypted phone calls.
it's your old emergency message box.
why did she call you?
i have no idea.
the last time i talked to him was two years ago when he got me off the mi0
she wants to talk right now.
that makes you useful.
can you help us find him?
no, thank you.
and you, harry, do you talk a lot about berlin?
the night your father died?
if there's anything else, mace, i have a right to know.
i don't think i can decide that...
if you're not really going to kill him, i think you've told me what you wanted
find harry, so you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
i thought i'd take that title to the grave.
she's been an anti-terrorist head for her majesty's security service lately
funny, but who are you really?
someone who knows what these two words mean to you.
asma shishani.
go.
how did you find me?
what do you want?
i know it was someone on my side.
they never told me who they were.
of course not, but you must have been connected.
a phone number, that's all.
the phone number will work.
in return, i'll give you what you want.
impossible.
he said he was a human rights lawyer.
your government helped them after i put my two brothers in jail.
but after i was released, she became too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if he's a spy, he's not
and then don't worry, tell her it's not worth anything to you again.
keep her alive, she's guaranteed to keep my promise.
i don't need guarantees.
take her to a hospital now or the deal's off!
what she needs is mercy.
no!
she has a daughter.
and you sent him after me?
you put her in danger and now you refuse to save her from pain?
how the fuck are you?
don't send her parents the video.
harry... harry
you have a deal.
according to the bbc, there's no improvement on the capture of adam qasim, the terrorist.
the national threat level has reached critical level, so there's an attack on his ear.
in the economy news, the ftse 000 fell again this morning and sterling continued to breathe the bucks, euros and other currency units.
there's a new intel on harry.
he's got a lead that we've been tracking through to kent coast.
holloway, this is classified.
we also found explosive tracks there.
you've known him longer than any of us.
do you think it's possible that qasim could have got harry involved somehow?
to take her with you?
i don't
anyway, you find harry, we find qasim.
anything for holloway?
here you go.
tomorrow,'00.
salpa 0, show a, park at bay one.
then, open your eyes.
i hope you come alone.
just for protection.
if you can't get a crazy cold war purple without shooting, we're really in trouble.
i don't promise.
it says not yet.
until we see him, we play this through harry.
roger that.
doors opening.
go.
ground floor.
doors opening.
open sightings, multiple exits.
repeat, holloway.
what harry needed to set up a meeting.
yes, mr. holloway, your uncle said he'd meet you at the coffee shop.
she left her cell phone at home.
the guy in the parking lot, get rid of him
he could wear an mi0 t-shirt.
listen to me.
stop underestimating harry.
don't think he won't risk your men.
wait for the signal to send...
what is it, alpha one?
holloway?
holloway, where are you going?
wait.
no, we don't have a pattern there
don't move.
holloway, don't move!
terminal 0b.
doors closing.
he got me a flight.
pa000, the plane of glasgow.
i'm going to glasgow.
call the glasgow office.
get me the airport police.
priority code sigma nine.
the police want a clear path to the terminal.
and get us permission for heathrow security.
pa000, passengers on the flight to glasgow...
holloway, don't go to the airport.
what am i doing here, harry?
i had to find someone i could trust outside the service.
it's a short list when you leave drunk, crazy and dead.
to be honest, the only person i can call a friend is someone who thinks i ruined her life.
qasim's escape was set up by someone at the top of the service.
by one of the people who asked you to follow me.
that's why i had to disappear.
you had qasim.
he's our only connection to the rene
once he's in the system, he'll be
he's planning an attack.
someone's trying to destroy the service itself.
you're crazy.
ruth's death...
don't
look at you, that's all i want.
what are you waiting for, harry?
mi0 was my everything and you took it from me, for nothing.
hate me all you want, but i think you believe in the service.
what happened in berlin?
is that how they tricked you?
this may not end as you'd hoped.
i'm afraid i have to tell them there's something in the lining of your jack
there's nothing there, of course, but they'll have to check
i'll send you a number.
call me in 00 hours, please.
i'm security services.
put your hands behind your back!
you just let her go.
calm down, francis.
we don't want you to have a heart
the deadly one.
mi0 looks like a complete liability right now, and i'm the last friend of mi0's government.
i mean, you really need to be nice to me right
in other words, is he crazy?
that doesn't contradict her with the last three psych
she refused to attend.
he didn't stop being harry pearce.
no matter how crazy he is, i still catch him...
for example.
she asked me to help her disappear.
you didn't think of taking what you wanted and bringing her to us?
don't think we can't put your life in a shitty position just'cause your life hasn't fucked up since harry fired you.
since we've threatened each other, don't get all three of you haven't been hanging on the cliff or anything.
your entire organization seems to be disposed of right now.
find qasim.
it's full
they're ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i saw that name working on a case.
i thought they took you off duty.
they've
now, what really happened?
the kidnapping may have been set up by someone in the service
do you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i left it two weeks ago.
there must be one around here.
tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't apply
when i was 00, i was hanging out with a guy who makes money transfers.
the k section was interested in some people using it, so they got to me.
you started as an agent?
and when i was done, they asked me to train as an officer.
when i told you, my family came back to me.
and if someone you work with helped qasim escape, that would be a problem, right?
all right.
something felt wrong that day.
rob vass, my team leader, he was in the front car with me.
he told me not to open the weapons compartment.
he ordered me to chase.
where does he live?
it's
the w00 account front.
panama city.
service bribery fund.
june, what are you here...
who are you?
you told me not to chase qasim.
you told me not to chase when i acted on my gun.
we swore an oath, rob.
i'm not saying anything until i get to thames house.
we're not going to the thames house.
will, what did you find?
qasim's bodyguards have been deliberately weakened
the team leader was involved.
she's just a sho
find out who gave the order.
the americans think mi0 is a weak link, and i think someone inside is joining them.
when qasim escaped, we fell out of sight.
the cia has taken it completely.
fire... fire
he was gonna shoot
her pulse... her
he's dead,
he's
listen.
you should go home.
june!
i'll handle this, but you have to go, now.
i didn't hear a piece of this song killed.
who's that warranty shot?
landon miller.
the agency hawk.
he's trying to secure his continued support and hopes not to give the keys to the kingdom.
every time i see you, francis, you look like you've been buried one or two inches of a cow that's been spinning from langley or the pentagon.
you don't have to tell me
i think at times like this, we shouldn't forget whose flag was shaken.
francis.
i'm trying to help, but she's officially accusing me of doing a job for the cia
tonight, your generals, your politicians, your spies, met for a celebration.
tonight, we will attack the heart of their power.
our enemy is the politicians who send your sons and your daughters to die in illegal wars.
the spies who spy on you like you are guilty.
this war is beyond religious differences.
all flights out of the u.s. kingdom
she had it.
warrender lived.
if you have a way to get to qasim, tell me now.
there's another way.
qasim's wife.
asma shishani.
she's got the fsb.
if i find out where they've kept her, she gives the traitor.
you made a deal with her.
yeah.
and if we succeed, it will lead us right to him.
surrender and set it up.
how do you know the russians have her?
in exchange for a cia agent trapped in moscow.
i can reach a distance, but you need to open the secret door.
it's a ip address.
you're kidding.
it's the only way, will
harry's getting help from somewhere.
i've eliminated their former contacts, but i need access to personnel files to do it properly.
but it won't take you anywhere exciting.
i'm in position.
looks like i'm gonna have to steal a lot of extra bandwid
the drink.
malcolm?
all right, i'm in.
i'm looking at the servers now
harry, we gotta go.
can't we do this faster?
i can do it.
but unfortunately, this machine is from the previous century.
the department's already pulled these
erin watts.
it could be worth a closer look.
fill the space for me.
but i had an agent released.
i almost got him out.
i've been in business less than a year.
sooner or later they make you choose.
all right, i'll leave you alone.
it's over?
am i sure what?
i'm sorry, will.
harry.
harry!
harry, what did you do?
stay away from the computer.
i didn't feel the need to say this before, but i hope you know what you're doing.
is harry working with qasim?
he stole an entire gchq data archive.
everything we have on our western agents in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
he was seen at the schaefffield airport cctv.
i don't
harry didn't do that cyber attack on his own.
then who's helping him?
except you.
and you're still protecting her.
why not?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i'll find her.
and there's a threat.
the analysis shows that within 00 hours there's gonna be a wide scale attack, there's
an officer in charge of qasim's escape is missing.
there are signs of a struggle in his house.
do you know anything about that?
how's your mother, holloway?
i heard it's not too good.
she hasn't packed since your father died.
understandable, really.
and then the doorbell comes.
i know, i know.
harry was right about one thing.
you're not good enough.
home secretary, can we really hope that qasim will stop the attack again?
we've destroyed the threats of our freedom and way of life.
your ability to hurt us may be important, but it's the end.
you'll find our decision has no limits.
they're not listening.
they never killed our women?
we're making the world a better place, brother.
transfer team at city airport.
we have a warrant atc to cover the road to the convict's vehicle whenever
i think i owe you one.
you were absolutely right about vass.
danke.
alexanderplatz.
northeast corner by the metron, 00th.
we have a safe house.
call it nostalgia.
don't forget to bring the archive
don't forget to bring his wife
how did you find me?
there's only one place in berlin to negotiate.
you told me.
northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
no emotionality.
that's the price of qasim's wife.
when she comes out of fsb custody, qasim will give me a number.
and he's taking me to the traitor
they're gonna destroy the service where it's vulnerable to take it.
get in the car, harry.
there's an old hotel 00 minutes away.
my contact can meet us there with a clean passport.
you're going home.
i'm sorry about that.
why are you here, mrs. keaton?
keep walking, harry.
i killed someone because of you.
you're c0, aren't
what are you doing, harry?
talent spotting.
and which one of you found it?
for god's sake, will
preparation is everything.
what about vass?
when you came to my house, i reported
i said someone was asking about qasim's escape.
they tied me to the command center and told me what to do.
they went to vass's house ahead of us and planted the evidence.
i've arranged for vass to escape.
you think i want to do it?
i know my duty.
i'm the only one here who
you were set up.
he's right, will.
but i wonder if miss keaton is sure about me.
it was a secure command chain.
what was i supposed to do?
do you believe him?
yeah.
i'm sure your men will come and find you, if your usefulness is still viable.
after all this is over, what do you think they're gonna do to
i did what they asked me to do.
we're changing the deal.
we're taking qasim's wife to london.
tell him you can't see his wife again.
let's go get her.
what happened to alexanderplatz?
a sudden agoraphobia sensation.
i'm afraid there was a problem with qasim's wife
at least be good enough to put it in my car.
harry.
colonel.
i hate to be modest, but we're gonna need your clothes.
as the search for adam qasim intensifies, everyone traveling on the national rail line of the united kingdom has to show valid identification and control of the suitcase.
i have your wife.
let me talk to her.
the russians put him to sleep and...
bullshit.
i'm bringing her to london.
no.
i'll tell your whore you said goodbye.
is the baby too much?
no, it's just you.
i trusted june.
you were right to take me off duty.
despite everything i've done, you're still doing something good here.
i won't let their sacrifice be in vain.
this was it.
was it fast?
she could have left me, but she chose not to leave me
if you try anything, anything, i can't guarantee anyone's safety.
nobody's
you bring my wife, i'll give you your number.
here we go.
hello?
holloway.
this message came from h branch.
me.
we can catch qasim, but we need help.
and let's go.
one clean choice, hannah.
trust me, and help me.
or go.
do it well or well, right?
damn it.
they're getting closer to the position
the self-developing algorithm i wrote last night is constantly updating, reviewing all potential views.
he's not cutting off the sudoku, then
please.
all right, we're here.
how much time do we have?
i'm looking at 000 cameras.
give me something.
the minute he realizes we're playing him, he
wait.
he was working 00 seconds ago.
are you sure?
yes, it's been confirmed.
the camera is down at the last minute.
third floor roof, east corner.
harry, we have to stall.
i hope you're looking right at us.
yes?
the south has called you.
i have his wife.
you were supposed to look south.
give me the number.
give me the number or we'll go.
turn around now or you're dead.
here.
so is he.
i haven't got him yet.
you have two seconds to turn around.
turn around.
maybe this guy's never seen her.
i'm almost there
him?
kill him.
give me the number.
don't
stop!
no!
okay?
will, she's fine.
the shooter's dead.
then it's over.
malcolm, feather.
yes?
my wife is dead, isn't
harry, listen.
let hannah report us.
harry?
hannah, why did harry take the headphones
i don't
let us know.
get sco00 here, now.
three loaded trucks loaded with rdx leaving limehouse north industrial park in the next 00 minutes.
how do you know?
qasim just told me.
truck loaded with bombs leaving in 00 minutes.
i think we got him.
let's go!
armed police!
stay where you are!
clear!
clear!
who saw the primary target?
negative!
negative!
negative, sir.
command, area clear.
harry.
he sold his own men.
why would he do that?
what did you do?
armed police!
don't move!
move!
you have to tell them everything, harry.
i think we have a lot to talk about.
this might be a little out of line.
since the southwest corner of alexanderplatz.
keep an eye on holloway.
make sure he's safe.
maybe we won't be so hasty.
did you find qasim?
harry will talk.
you still don't know him.
qasim gave up his entire operation.
what did you say to him?
i should have thought they'd set you free after berlin.
they want to offer you a deal.
put everything on harry and go.
i told them i'd quit after i did this.
there's no way
i can't
there's an emergency backup key around her neck.
whatever you're up to... wh
what would ruth think?
what did you give her?
check the back.
southwest corner.
i found harry on the northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
the opposite.
where you're gonna trap somebody.
harry?
i gave her you.
get down!
get down!
get down!
lock us down.
get down!
get down!
we're not here for you!
we came for them.
get down!
think about your families.
hamza.
why not?
there are 00 men on the other side of these gates.
you must surrender.
come here.
open it!
if you think we're gonna negotiate...
open the door.
but he'll kill us.
there are too many demons in one room.
the only way to get out of here alive is to
you think i want to get out?
how many people's lives began to end in this room
my people's lives.
your people?
i didn't ask you to speak for them, to kill for them.
if you want a hostage hostage...
i think he's made it clear he's not interested
i'm the director general of mi0.
kill me and put the gun down.
otherwise, you're nothing but a dead terrorist.
no one will see you as a hero.
when we're done, you're gonna be a drunken, wife-beating, powerless heathen.
we'll send a few marrakech male hookers forward and give them free tickets to disneyland for telling them you begged them to piss on you.
we can't remember you very well, can we, adam?
wait, wait, wait.
i pulled the helicopter back.
but... but
you fucking coward.
i thought you were fighting a higher standard.
i'm sorry about your wife's death, adam
i know what this can do to you.
is this supposed to stop me?
it's
stop!
why did you bring her here?
i made a choice.
without plan b.
why do you think i'm keeping you out of that room?
people are still dead, harry.
it's a lot less of what's gonna die in
how can you make such a choice?
it's my job.
aunt, can you come outside and play?
hello, geraldine.
finally, it comes down to who's got the longest lie.
right?
if we had kept that morning, qasim would never have escaped.
you gave the met's air unit an order to reverse all mi0 requests, didn't you?
that's the advantage of being a lonely maniac.
i don't have to prove it
sacrificing his own fortune so he could be questioned by a foreign power.
the americans would have made you director general, of course.
how many more lives was that promotion worth?
what did you think you did, harry?
the service is dying
but if i'd given up the moment i realized i was on the loser side, my career would be
blow my brains out, find my 00-year-old nephew...
i think this came from you.
what is it?
the thin bowel is penetrating more than six hours or causing unstoppable hemorrhaging.
no sign.
how clever.
i was afraid that would be your answer.
that's why i took the chance to choose.
it's not lunch that makes you sick.
i ate beef ribs.
tell me you're lying, harry.
please.
tell me you didn't betray your country.
it's been four hours, geraldine.
you can spend the last three hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd play with your pretty niece.
i'm thinking.
your message said you'd tell me something.
they're spying on ruth's grave.
you can't go anymore
i have something that you should be.
your father was wearing this the night he died.
stasi pulled out everything that would work and found a way to get into the fsb archive somewhere.
she was wearing a wedding ring on the night of her operation?
i didn't kick you out because you weren't good enough
after your father, i couldn't...
i should have protected you.
good ones don't last forever, will.
then who does?
they're like me
it would really help if you knew your problem and told the men at the door.
there's room for every guest at the hotel junior high.
gather round at once.
these new problems kill in the dark.
these people will be grateful when it's dark.
i think we should keep them here to keep them safe, but i'm worried things are getting worse.
they have no idea who caused the dark trouble.
and what we need to worry about isn't what's hiding
we still haven't figured out how to lift that fog wall
maybe it's a blessing.
this was the latest from in-flight safety.
i'm on your side and i might need a new job.
i've got it under control, but if i can get another pillow for my beauty sleep, it's gonna be
try to make things right.
we talked about this.
it's almost impossible to destroy the problem without killing him.
of course, i just need information that's impossible to get the tools that i don't have and that may not exist.
i'm gonna need a team
do you have any idea what's going on?
but there's a bad element.
it's the only way to protect the rest of us
it's too risky to drive because of the magnet problem
an engineer to help fix the power plant.
he volunteered as soon as he found out.
if things don't work out, you can use her problem for the operator.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
no trace killer is out there somewhere.
and i think he really wants to prove that he wants to help you.
all right, whatever the reason, just keep an eye on her for me, okay?
because neither of us is immune to new problems.
i'm not just saying that it's
when you're gone, i'll call the person who caused the dark trouble at school.
he stole those batteries and put us in danger.
there was no other choice, dwight.
this is the third time in two weeks.
now the serial killer is in this building.
all right, i'm gonna go talk to dwight.
my father always said you were a good man.
mara's father?
there may be a way, but if you want me to explain it, it may seem more frightening, so
even on the map, maine, i can't find haven.
are you telling me you can't find a town with 00,000 people?
that's not cause problems.
then why didn't we use aether in the first place to end the troubles?
i can't bring them with seals.
so how do we find it?
gloria brought a box of stuff that duke left in gull.
i don't think william has the amount i need, and, uh, aather is just the first stage.
you told his wife you'd find him.
it's easy to make decisions from the sidelines, but sometimes
i have a town to protect.
no wonder the plant worked at 00%.
guys, i'll try, but just remember, i've never done anything like this before.
they parked here so i could talk to you, but i don't even have enough money to pay for the oil change.
if all goes well, i'll be back with aether before the sun goes down.
this is peggy's husband, rolf.
there's enough panic and fear.
the same killer that killed my son 00 years ago?
we call him "the murderer who won't leave a mark."
what else are you hiding from me, vince?
dwight's doing everything he can to make the rules accept, but he's not someone to kill people.
in this haven, exile is the same as executing.
thanks to our friend there, we're holding them in some kind of prison.
he says the generator works at 00%.
damn it, when the generator overloaded it must have unloaded energy reserves.
that explains why the power's in town.
at this rate, about five minutes.
it's almost over, and it's the only thing that protects us from dying
here, i've rearranged the generator settings to get the power to the town faster, but there's nothing else we can do.
they'd better get back.
help each other.
put the lamps around you.
share your supplies.
you see, i'm happy here.
i got your message.
get in the car now.
come on, jump!
if the war lies ahead, we should be thankful, even slean.
i don't think there's anything worse than being in love.
i don't like it here.
every story has two sides.
whoever's behind this is a traitor.
let's go.
he asked me to represent him at slean's wedding.
the palace, you are my brother's love.
that's why you're my brother.
you've seen bigger places in the iraqi realms.
none of them were ruled by a woman.
you must choose a second person to escort you and watch your interests during the ritual.
then you will hear the ties of your friends and relatives.
i don't have any rel
my mother and the others will accompany you.
kela, this is the palace of bregan.
rheda, does it always have to be a bodyguard for me
i don't really get it.
but i know i have to marry slean.
i'll love her.
this marriage can't happen
abrecan trusts you.
what do you do?
carpenters.
they can use you on the wall, then.
who are you?
a friend of the council president.
like i said, i have work to attend to.
we need to figure out how to handle it.
varr said i couldn't accept gifts.
then it's between us.
every bride should smell nice when it's
remember, it's our secret.
sit down.
we'll take what we're gonna get when they look at the
you wanted to talk?
all right.
kela, it's time for the ritual.
elvina, are you gonna be the second person i've got
for the game.
we need to talk sometime.
we need to discuss the reasons why marriage shouldn't work.
if we don't fulfil our duties, their marriage can be
beowulf!
let's celebrate.
according to ancient customs!
the dress absorbs the smell.
i'm so sorry.
it was just a little mistake.
that's all
we're gonna help slean give the symbol to his bride.
that sounds easy.
breca!
open the door!
come on, you stinking mudborn.
come on!
come on!
give me your arm.
come on!
slean.
be quiet, it's bald.
are they ready for this marriage?
i don't understand why slean wouldn't want to marry kela.
i don't think so.
she has to put her feelings aside and do what's best for everyone.
would you put aside what you wanted for others?
that's what we all have to do.
if someone spends their whole life pleasing others, then that person doesn't actually live.
thinking like that must make you feel very free.
try it.
tell every rock the truth.
but then you can look at each other and light the fire that symbolizes your marriage.
then you'll be husband and wife.
have you ever loved someone before?
no.
before you came here... you were... you
do you want to be thane?
tell my uncle i'm done with him.
go.
come on!
go!
you let her go.
we're not done here.
don't you understand?
i betrayed my mother and set up a plot with my uncle.
this woman was sent here to kill you!
i don't
is that so?
i killed my brother.
she's the one she was supposed to be
even if the world was gone, mara had everything.
people loved him because he was kind.
my father loved her as his first child.
she and rowan were lovers.
then i had the chance to escape.
i wouldn't need anything.
she was dead without fever.
he was getting better.
i poisoned her.
slean, i won't tell anyone what you did here today and what happened.
or stay.
i know, but he's beowulf's.
she went to bed the other night.
but we can choose who we can draw our fate with.
light the fire with me.
you want to be thane?
i can help you.
against what you see.
they can't take it from you, rheda.
with this marriage, you are the jarl of the shieldlands.
these rules of jarl should be held by every tribe.
if the blood money isn't paid, a killer's life will
thieves will be branded and expelled from society.
all the merchandise for trading at the shieldlands will be set by jarl.
what right does he have to decide the price of fish?
we're the ones risking their life to catch the pandiri every summer.
you should have told me about the rules.
you were where your people needed you the most, on guard duty.
i couldn't distract you
it was messy enough.
you're late for the pandiri
some think he's missing her again.
but if you fail, bregan will be in misery and he'll starve the winter.
breca's wanted for murder, you know that.
kill him!
kill breca now!
i got it!
if you do it without any explanation, we're all dead
he hired us to bring breca to the law after he escaped the gallows.
we were gonna ask the guy who helped him escape the first time?
that's why we're gonna welcome
but we have to keep breca.
herot could be at our gates as we speak!
when did we kill young women?
what do you mean?
you've been hiding in the shadows too long, abre
don't forget who you're talking
talk.
he wants breca's life or blood money for the murder of his brother.
i didn't mean to kill anyone.
hurry up!
thank you.
breca made my mother fall in love with herself
he's looking for the dirt he thinks he's got money, then he steals the money and runs, this motherf
she left my mother and took all her precious things with her.
my brother came after you.
but it cost his life.
breca, is that true?
i'll pay for your brother's blood money.
lila, do you have 00 silver coins?
i don't want money, i want blood
silence!
if the blood money is paid, breca will be released.
you lied to me.
pandiri.
pandiri!
put him through.
get ready, they're coming.
i saw it.
get out!
the council has gathered
harken wants to take my place because i missed the pandiri.
you let me down, she married slean keela, rheda jarl!
you don't understand
tell the council that our enemies are gathering, that your sister cannot rule, that she wants to save the shieldlands.
so tell me you're distracted.
say it.
i'm sorry
i knew breca had killed someone, but the story she told me was different.
it's only her fault.
lila, nobody thinks bad things about you...
that's all i have.
did you bring it?
there aren't 00 silver
not enough.
and i'm gonna hold breca while i see her work.
was there enough money?
lila?
turn it off, beowulf, please.
you won't talk to lila.
get on your horse, leave heroot and never come back.
there's no more room for you here
if herot's attacked, i want to fight properly.
if herot's attacked, i'll protect you.
let's try it
it's not about mudborn.
i don't want to talk about him
i want to know why you lied about training me.
it's wasted when you use it.
you don't even want to be a huskar
is that so?
i didn't know we were training the blacksmiths!
go.
now!
he's fighting girls now?
the view was more like the blacksmith was training huskarl.
i know you think i let you down.
that i can't focus on my duties in bregan.
but i have my reasons.
you're talking about betraying your own blood.
the center of this land needs a warrior!
someone who will take your people out of the darkness
a man in power to take control!
you're talking about betraying your sister to hide the fact that you can't afford the needs of your people.
what's the point of having fish if we're all to be slaughtered?
i'm here to vote no confidence in our thane.
those who oppose abrecan as thane.
it's been
a new thane will be appointed and announced in the morning.
get up.
next.
nobody.
don't think it's a
we're lazy, we're distract
this is gonna work out here.
from now on, we're gonna work like my dad hrothgar.
i didn't mean to interrupt
you're a good teacher.
a great thane wants a strong army behind him.
we don't have to share the same bed, but if we don't share the same room, people will
i've always liked watching herot from here.
it looks so invincible.
if i tell my mother the truth, i'll lose her trust.
and the chance to rule one day.
what if abrecan attacks?
herot could fall.
aren't you going to advise me?
i trust you.
your decision will be correct.
and i'll be there when i make it
you'll be thane.
you just have to believe it.
pandiri.
pandiri!
that's the pandir
sound the horn!
i command you, steal the horn!
abrecan, give it up.
if we don't act now, we'll be able to
why... why
you help me with the net.
help me with the net now.
why don't you help?
pandiri!
come on, hurry up!
go find me a sack.
people shouldn't leave their precious stuff lying around.
you owe my mother an apology.
but i'm a warrior and honour is at stake.
so i'll take your life.
go back to mommy, little girl.
greetings.
i didn't need your help.
because he didn't have enough money to save you.
be thankful you didn't kill him, vishka
if we don't plant the nets, our prey will be
no, he won't.
get ready.
abrecan, no!
hold the rope steady!
hurry up, they'll eat you raw!
pandiri, pandiri!
pandiri, pandiri!
hold on tight!
now stretch!
take a look.
there will be songs about this hunt.
a hunt you won.
i have a dream about us.
the biggest tribe in shieldlands!
we're not gonna follow the laws that a jarl couldn't even keep a sword
who's with me?
abrecan, abrecan, abrecan!
i need to warn beowulf.
bregan!
elvina!
the warriors are coming together.
they intend to destroy us this time.
beowulf!
if we look around us today, we'll see that more danger and harm come from religious beliefs.
my wife, stand-up shows that if i talked about soviet communism or the violence of stalin, she'd be less embarrassed.
it's the kind of interrogation that irritates things that make trouble for people, especially the philosophy.
to present a situation perfectly true within herself, it can cause serious damage, damage.
when the prophecy doesn't come true, we make fun of those people and the whole world laughs with us.
i had a friendly disagreement with richard dawkins for this problem.
maybe richard and i should be more aggressive.
especially america is surrounded by christian faith.
they're sure the world is what their religion says it is.
we'll get rid of the bad gu
i'd like to write a book like this, if i could.
but, of course, one of my fears, what happens next.
what kind of chaos?
how right is it to do that to people who think that we're doing what's religion, and the good in us?
religion is like a moral viagra for many people.
if that's true, if religion leads to the moral life of the people, anyone will take it seriously and turn the life of us into the lower business.
because there's a lot of people down there, and we can create a chaos from the fear of these people.
a lot of people want their lives to mean something, and where does that come from?
but there must be something better than religion.
yeah, there's definitely hope.
let's see what happens.
of course.
at least you didn't get piercing.
i don't know how to explain this to amy.
i'm the dumbest man in
all right, stop it.
i'm the dumbest man in
all right, you win this.
i can't find emma's papers.
honey, just so you know, even if you find the original receipt, you can't return the baby.
i need to find the paper that angela signed when she left emma on my doorstep and gave me her only deputy.
i'm finally gonna get the health insurance that i'm responsible for looking at myself
i haven't talked to her since the night we did emma.
calm down.
you gave me all the important papers on the baby to be safe.
do you have all the papers?
her father's little girl is his father'
it could be something with balloons.
it's beautiful!
did you rob a clown?
it's your birthday!
first, my birthday is tomorrow.
you used to party all the time when you
celebrating my birthday after...
"happy birthday, miley."
you know those papers i kept for me.
how irresponsible do you think i am?
but i'm
i may have mailed them in time, but she didn't get mailed, and ben may not be the only owner of emma.
we were all excited about the new baby, and i didn't have a stamp!
look, if we have angela sign this document again, we'll be fine.
because you're ben's best friend and you're the only one who's seen the girl
i like it very much, all right.
all right, emma's finally asleep
hey, danny, what's wrong with riley not wanting to celebrate her birthday?
why does she really hate it so much?
ben, riley didn't celebrate her birthday after her disastrous birthday party.
are you sure you want to watch this?
i think i'd remember if it was a disaster.
all right, come on, everybody.
danny, where are we going?
luckily for the future, you've got a real mustache and lost weight for one.
is ben here?
benjamin wheeler, come here and celebrate riley's birthday.
well, i can tell you this is my best birthday ever.
tell me you didn't do anything to the cake.
in fact, try to save it with the perm first and then cut it out
is riley still in love with ben or is that something that happened when she was a kid?
unless you're still in love with riley.
i ruined her "happy 00" birthday party.
she's not in her birthdays, but she sure loves you the rest
if ben's so irresponsible and so afraid to lose the papers, maybe he doesn't deserve to take emma's deputy alone.
if it makes you feel any better, we do most of the work.
i can imagine how hard it is to leave emma.
i knew how pretty, funny or wonderful you'd end up hurting her!
in your presence on the streets of the city, the elite tank of the american military, in just three minutes, the slade trooper 00.
also known as madox-00 as the weapon we understand as a limited range of combat capabilities.
what's more, a uh-00 has more damage power than blackhawk.
it's all about anti-terrorist and anti-gerilla operations.
miss kusumoto is also the architect of the software that is preparing for "tankbuster."
in order to demonstrate the enmity of the madox's abilities with the lamp, he personally went to the pilot's cabin
unit 0 will go to ichigaya tonight.
we're in a hurry, so be quick as we can.
oh, what the...
miss kusumoto today, you've made me quite humiliated
i'm not here to congratulate
there's only one thing i'll tell you:
wow!
kouji...
what's this?
onose, you leave this to me!
they just threw away their garbage.
i'm telling you, don't worry
i'll buy you dinner in return, won't i?
the transport vehicle from the sdf...
according to the report reports, it was only natural that this case was
it's obviously a terrorist thing
you're too alien to operations with the east-blind.
i hope you know what you're saying!
i hope you see that the burden of the accident is entirely yours.
either way, the situation we're in is critical.
we were transporting him for a field test!
it's terrib
i have to be in charge of the operation.
besides, madox-00 is currently being repaired.
while investigating the scene, the cars around the scene are giving us trouble.
shouldn't we have the police backup on the phone?
we must prepare ourselves for the worst, and keep the assistants ready.
i'm the only one who can stand in front of the madox and keep head.
although lt. kilgore is one of the "enestials," he's our best tanker in the army.
is this okay?
nobody's in the apartment, huh
anyway, i'm a little relieved.
shiori really was a pretty girl...
when he goes to study england, all the boys in japan will be grieved.
where did you learn that?
he called me in the morning and asked me to give you a message.
use the open remote to open them.
it's burning!
the pilot was able to adjust the cabin.
it feels like he's wearing a boat to ski.
we've got the madox's activation signal.
this is a disaster.
could you warm it up in the microwave?
i really fucked myself up!
shiori, what do you want?
defense?
you're on a mission with the prototype airborne tank.
don't you dare turn tokyo to vietnam!
tokyo or vietnam, all battlefields are the same to me.
you'll be a disaster.
oh, don't be alarmed.
i'm gonna get through this before i get too hot.
lieutenant kilgore is using the most advanced tank and anti-tank helicopters and his promise to take the madox off duty as a "buy."
in that case, there's gonna be a big pan
under the circumstances, there must be someone who can stop kilgore and madox.
what can we do?
we don't know the madox's target yet.
if i manage to find her before lieutenant kilgore, then maybe we'll have a chance.
but the madox situation...
i'm using unit #0, she's successfully out of power tests.
what are the chances of success
hey, you heard me!
wait for me.
that's it!
how you doing!
what are you doing on the road?
i can't wait by the side of the side of the road like
you're a real driver, man!
i've still got a lot to finish their installments
cabriolette's back!
goodbye, motherfuckers!
yeah, he was really off on saturday night, somewhere near shinjuku, car traffic.
i can't lose my mark in this crowd!
this "madox" must be really valuable.
spider 0 to jackal 0.
target movement!
she's moving on her own
one of the apaches was shot down.
all units are authorized to destroy the madox.
just as kilgore wanted.
he's heading for the skyscrapers with the apaches in
he must evacuate the civilians immediately!
they're all over me!
i gotta go that way and use the west exit.
there's been another crazy armored rag standing!
all right, back to work, madox!
i hear you.
and i say, "you're a pain in the head."
if anyone's causing a disturbance, it's you.
"just" what?
it's none of your business.
i can't do anything i don't know what
oh, no!
okay, captain!
"nsr park parking spot - "
exit " exit
i did it!
shiori's upstairs!
i won't let you... take another step.
