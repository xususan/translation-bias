hello, <unk> </s>
in the end, it comes down to who can tell the <unk> <unk> </s>

if i had waited that morning, i would never have left <unk> </s>
the <unk> air force <unk> an order to <unk> all <unk> <unk> right? </s>
that's why you're a lonely <unk> </s>
you don't have to worry. </s>

the americans would have made you <unk> <unk> </s>
how many more lives was that <unk> </s>

what is it? </s>
the <unk> <unk> <unk> over six hours or so, causing <unk> <unk> </s>

i was afraid that would be the answer. </s>
that's why i took the opportunity to make a choice. </s>
it's not your lunch that's <unk> your <unk> </s>
so i ate the <unk> <unk> </s>
tell me you're lying, harry. </s>
please. </s>
tell me you didn't betray <unk> </s>
it's been four hours, <unk> </s>
you can spend the last two in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd go and play with that beautiful <unk> </s>
i'm thinking. </s>
your letter said something to me. </s>

you can't go anymore. </s>

i don't blame you for not being good enough. </s>
after the <unk> the <unk> </s>
you <unk> </s>

then who does? </s>
they're like me. </s>
it would really help if you could tell the men in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> </s>
there is room for every <unk> in the <unk> <unk> </s>
form up, single <unk> </s>
this new trouble kills in darkness. </s>
these people will be grateful to you for the dark side. </s>
i think we're going to be here to keep them safe, but i just worry that it's only gonna get worse. </s>
they have no idea who caused the dark <unk> </s>
besides, it's not what <unk> in the dark we need to worry about. </s>
let's show these <unk> how we can get rid of <unk> </s>
maybe it's a <unk> </s>
this is the last <unk> of <unk> <unk> </s>
i might need your <unk> and a new job. </s>
it's under <unk> but i'd love another <unk> for my beauty sleep. </s>
try to fix the <unk> </s>
we talked about this. </s>
it's almost impossible to destroy him with <unk> <unk> </s>
sure, i just need <unk> <unk> to be <unk> and maybe knowledge that aren't there. </s>
i'm gonna need a team. </s>
any idea what's going on? </s>
but i have a bad memory. </s>
it's the only way to get him back. </s>
with the <unk> problem the car was <unk> too. </s>
an <unk> to help <unk> the electrical <unk> </s>
he <unk> as soon as he found out. </s>
if things go well, we'll have to take his word for it. </s>
what the hell do you think you're doing? </s>
<unk> <unk> killer is out there somewhere. </s>
and i think he really wants to prove to you that he really wants to help. </s>
okay, well, whatever the reason, just keep an eye on her for me, okay? </s>
because we're both <unk> to new <unk> </s>
i'm not just saying it's my mom. </s>
while you're gone, i'm going to look for the person who caused dark <unk> in school. </s>
he stole those <unk> and put us in danger. </s>
there was no other choice, <unk> </s>
that's the third time in two weeks. </s>
and now the serial killer is in this <unk> </s>
all right, i'm gonna go talk to <unk> </s>
my dad always said you were a good guy. </s>
<unk> father? </s>
there might be a way, but if you ask me to explain it, it will be <unk> so you can fix it.
i can't even find a <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
you're telling me you can't find a town with <unk> people? </s>
that didn't cause any problems. </s>
then why didn't we use <unk> to end the <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
so how does it work? </s>
a box of <unk> <unk> left behind by the <unk> </s>
i don't think that <unk> has the amount i need, and <unk> is just the first <unk> </s>
<unk> said you would find him. </s>
it's easy making <unk> but sometimes things aren't what they <unk> </s>
i have a town to <unk> </s>
<unk> of the <unk> is <unk> <unk> </s>
guys, i'll try, but i've never done anything like this before. </s>
i can't even afford to park the car here so i can talk to you. </s>
if all goes well, i'll be back with the <unk> at <unk> </s>
that's <unk> husband, <unk> </s>
there's enough panic and fear. </s>
the same killer that killed my son 27 years ago? </s>
we call it <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
what else are you hiding from me, <unk> </s>
<unk> is doing his best to keep order to <unk> the rules, but he's not one to kill people. </s>

thanks to our friend there, we're holding them in some kind of prison. </s>
<unk> says he's working <unk> </s>
damn it, the <unk> must have <unk> energy <unk> </s>

this is about five minutes from the <unk> </s>

i'm so sorry, <unk> </s>
it's a terrible <unk> for everyone who <unk> a mother. </s>

and it made me realize that i need to let it go. </s>
but i think you should know that i slept with a man. </s>
actually, i got it from <unk> </s>
you have no idea how <unk> it must have been. </s>
if i had the chance to handle everything, i would. </s>
i came to pay my <unk> </s>
i know i missed my chance. </s>
i'm not half the man you <unk> </s>
but i asked myself, </s>
<unk> what do you have to do to help those girls you love so much? </s>
and it occurred to me that i was <unk> you, so i <unk> you a proper man so that you could tell me about your new friend. </s>
and it breaks my heart, because your <unk> <unk> is a <unk> </s>
we don't need to see that. </s>
what's the matter with you? </s>
you're a pain in the ass, and i'm not gonna stop until i tell you. </s>

i don't blame her. </s>
why are you <unk> </s>
there was food ready in the <unk> </s>
i told you. </s>
it's just for a little <unk> that's all. </s>
i was at <unk> last night. </s>
the night before that we had <unk> <unk> </s>
your father doesn't like foreign <unk> </s>
only the red <unk> <unk> </s>
he doesn't drink red wine. </s>
mom, it's the <unk> </s>
i don't want him <unk> a <unk> while i'm here. </s>
nobody ever gets a <unk> from <unk> <unk> </s>
calm down, <unk> </s>
it was worth it. </s>
i'm just here with my <unk> and don't worry about me. </s>
you sure you want to come, daddy? </s>
it's gonna be a long meeting. </s>
no, i will. </s>
it'll do me good. </s>
i could buy you a lunch here, you could catch a movie. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
i'll be fine. </s>
okay. </s>
john <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> please. </s>
he's expecting you. </s>
dad, you think you can handle this much <unk> here? </s>
of course, nobody threw anything at me. </s>
john, good to see you. </s>

good to see you too, <unk> </s>
this is my dad, jake <unk> </s>
dad, this is <unk> <unk> </s>
nice to meet you, mr. <unk> </s>
me too. </s>
can we be here in an hour? </s>
like i said. </s>
okay, well, take care, dad. </s>
wait a minute. </s>
we can't leave your father here. </s>
mr. <unk> why don't you come in and sit with us? </s>
i can handle this. </s>
<unk> we've given you every <unk> and now our <unk> still <unk> less than <unk> </s>
how can you be so sure of yourself? </s>
<unk> never run a business like this before. </s>
and if you don't, we're gonna be <unk> <unk> and we're not gonna do business with you again. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
every minute he's open is <unk> but the property he's on is worth at least 50 million. </s>
how can you be so sure of the 50 million <unk> </s>
we sold it to <unk> a little <unk> </s>
do you have any <unk> </s>
can i see <unk> now? </s>
the real estate is <unk> million and we don't have a problem with all the <unk> around it. </s>
all of the general <unk> are <unk> but we have a <unk> that our <unk> <unk> will be <unk> within a few months. </s>
isn't it enough to sell it? </s>
and if you say that, then we can <unk> the records. </s>
if this goes well, you won't have to. </s>
i don't think it's worth it. </s>
you can't do this! </s>
the other thing is food <unk> which is good <unk> </s>
now, <unk> seems to be <unk> with cash <unk> but it's not <unk> </s>
so we don't have a problem taking credit out of <unk> <unk> </s>
yeah, this looks good. </s>
johnny, what's going on in there? </s>
well, we're like a <unk> <unk> dad. </s>
i didn't know you had it in you. </s>
actually, i don't. </s>
the guy coming to us for money doesn't either. </s>
we're just gonna run the company, and then we're gonna stop the <unk> </s>
that's your job? </s>
are you <unk> <unk> and then <unk> </s>
it's a little more complicated than that, dad. </s>
we take this <unk> from <unk> </s>
it <unk> after the company. </s>
this third <unk> is <unk> and <unk> <unk> </s>
but i have a little <unk> <unk> and that's the key to it. </s>
the <unk> is <unk> on a <unk> <unk> </s>
so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and then <unk> </s>
have you ever tried this <unk> <unk> </s>
there's no money in that, dad. </s>
the world is <unk> johnny. </s>
how the world <unk> <unk> </s>

the world belongs to two <unk> </s>
<unk> and <unk> </s>
i don't know, dad, <unk> </s>
it's all right, johnny. </s>
there's nothing wrong here. </s>
i'm a <unk> that's all. </s>
but you, you're <unk> </s>
you like to be <unk> </s>
i refuse to take responsibility. </s>
you're a <unk> </s>

what are you talking about? </s>
that's my dad. </s>
those are the rules. </s>
i'm not going to <unk> the test as long as i

somebody stop that man! </s>
i'm just happy. </s>

there are some kids from school. </s>
we have very similar <unk> </s>

johnny, something's wrong. </s>
could you come here and take a look? </s>
that's enough, mr. <unk> </s>
if you like. </s>
is he okay? </s>
yeah, he's good. </s>
<unk> starts with a <unk> </s>
not yet. </s>
any idea what's wrong? </s>
it could be one of a few things. </s>
i suspect <unk> is <unk> </s>
the problem is whether they're good <unk> </s>
do you think that will <unk> your <unk> </s>
not at all. </s>
<unk> not a good sign. </s>
so this is serious? </s>
i think we should take him to a general <unk> </s>

that's <unk> isn't it? </s>
mom, i told you. </s>
it was just a dream, and i loved it. </s>
i want to see her. </s>

this is exactly the same with the other <unk> </s>
<unk> are often <unk> after every simple <unk> </s>
is that it? </s>
any idea what goes on in there? </s>
i know this is a scary experience for you, but what you need to understand is that what we're dealing with here. </s>
you can call when you get here. </s>
why are you crying now? </s>
<unk> strange <unk> </s>
it comes and goes away. </s>
this kind of <unk> stress can change in a <unk> </s>
i'm sure it's a good <unk> and <unk> condition is <unk> </s>
what do we do in the <unk> </s>
nothing. </s>
what do you mean, <unk> </s>
we wait for <unk> to answer our questions. </s>
did you tell dad he has <unk> </s>
he has the right to know. </s>
i don't know exactly what you want from me, mr. <unk> </s>
dr. <unk> </s>
i don't trust <unk> </s>
you are the hospital <unk> and i just want you to know that this is our business. </s>
dr. <unk> is a good, young <unk> </s>
he seems to be very <unk> and <unk> about your father. </s>
i told him not to say anything about cancer to my father because he's too afraid of this <unk> </s>
but he went ahead and told him that. </s>
yes, it's hard for a doctor to say. </s>
he has to ensure your father's knowledge of the family <unk> does not <unk> </s>
i'm sure he had no choice. </s>
i had a <unk> </s>
don't listen to me. </s>
i know my father. </s>
why are you <unk> your <unk> </s>
to keep him from hurting himself. </s>
keep your <unk> to yourself. </s>
well, then i think she was <unk> and i don't need any of that. </s>
tell us when you're ready, and we'll put him back in his place. </s>
i can't believe this. </s>
hey, dad, how's it going? </s>
you always say that? </s>
look, hey, look, look, i brought <unk> </s>
and billy is here. </s>
hey, dad. </s>
how are you feeling, daddy? </s>
can you hear me? </s>
hey, <unk> it's me, billy. </s>
how's it going? </s>
god, john, i can't stand to see him looking like this. </s>
i think that's enough. </s>
i gave him a <unk> </s>
that would destroy him. </s>
how long has he been like that? </s>
the whole time we've been here. </s>
<unk> </s>
jesus, doc. </s>
it's a good thing you're not a detective. </s>
yeah, he seemed <unk> </s>
what the hell is going on in here? </s>
i meant more than <unk> mr. <unk> </s>
mr. <unk> </s>
you keep telling me it's the usual thing to do, doctor. </s>
it's not the <unk> <unk> <unk> but the <unk> will bring him around. </s>
<unk> </s>
the man is <unk> </s>
he's <unk> </s>
he doesn't know anyone in his family, and you gave him a <unk> </s>
why don't you tell him about <unk> </s>
maybe <unk> can do it, too. </s>
we decided to <unk> your father tomorrow. </s>
you can pick him up after <unk> </s>
what do you mean, <unk> </s>
are you trying to tell me that my father has <unk> </s>
well, no, of course not, but <unk> speaking there's nothing more we can do for him. </s>
we cannot hold <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> </s>
how did you <unk> </s>
no help from a <unk> </s>
what exactly do you mean? </s>
whatever you say. </s>
so it wasn't even <unk> who died. </s>
what kind of speech is that? </s>
turn it off! </s>
just calm down. </s>
you want my father out of here? </s>
look what i'm gonna do. </s>
i'll do better than you <unk> </s>
you're not good enough to take care of him. </s>
john, what are you doing? </s>
mr. <unk> you can't trust him. </s>
that's not necessary. </s>
i say we bring him home. </s>
mr. <unk> this is <unk> </s>
what do we do now? </s>
i don't know. </s>
we don't have much choice. </s>
no, i don't want to do that. </s>
i don't want to take him to a <unk> </s>
me too, john, but we have to do something. </s>
wait a second, john. </s>
you can't help him in this situation. </s>
i think i can do that. </s>
i can do better than <unk> </s>
i'll stay and help. </s>
no. </s>
why not? </s>
i'll take care of her. </s>
he's my father. </s>
well, he's my <unk> </s>
and i'm your mother. </s>
i don't want you here right now, billy. </s>
you can't do this! </s>
dad, i'm not a kid. </s>

go back to school, go back to mexico. </s>
you get out of here. </s>

yeah, i get it. </s>
i want to talk to him. </s>
i don't think that's a good idea right now, mom, really. </s>
<unk> right, mom. </s>
have a <unk> </s>
you'd like that, wouldn't you, <unk> </s>
i meant <unk> mom. </s>
it's just a <unk> <unk> </s>

you'll have to work on your <unk> </s>
okay. </s>
what you need is a little <unk> </s>
well, i think you're right. </s>
wait till you taste this. </s>
come on, dad. </s>
okay. </s>
hmm, okay. </s>
here. </s>
try this. </s>
come on, dad, take a piece. </s>
come on, there you go. </s>
let's try the <unk> </s>
dad, don't throw things out the window. </s>
the lady of the house. </s>
you like it there, don't you? </s>
neither do i. </s>
good luck, huh? </s>
come on, dad. </s>
that's better. </s>
okay, dad. </s>
hang on a second here and i'll kill you. </s>
let me grab these and i'll be right back.
why are you here, <unk> </s>
why are you here, <unk> </s>

you know, if you're worried about <unk> <unk> </s>
where's the <unk> </s>
this is your <unk> dad. </s>
what are you talking about? </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
i'm worried about her. </s>
well, don't worry, dad. </s>
<unk> sure she's okay. </s>
you think so? </s>
it is. </s>
help me with the <unk> <unk> for my <unk> </s>
it's got to be done now. </s>
look. </s>
what we need now is a good night's sleep. </s>
you always said there was a problem, <unk> </s>
get down on the <unk> </s>
i mean, you got <unk> now, dad. </s>
let's sit on it. </s>
daddy? </s>
daddy? </s>
daddy? </s>
dad, where are you? </s>
daddy? </s>
daddy? </s>
daddy? </s>
daddy? </s>
what the hell are you doing? </s>
oh, dad, come on, let me help you. </s>
come here, dad, come on. </s>
no. </s>
dad, i'm moving the bed. </s>
get out. </s>
come on, dad, out. </s>
dad, come on. </s>
i've got you. </s>
<unk> </s>
come on. </s>
<unk> </s>
i've got you, i've got you. </s>
i've got you. </s>
mr. <unk> </s>
i understand you're going back to the hospital. </s>
yeah. </s>
i thought it might be difficult for you to care for him at home.
it's really not the place for her right now. </s>
you could stay at home, could stay here, right? </s>
perhaps you'd better ask a <unk> <unk> </s>
i know how kids say <unk> <unk> </s>
to know what that means. </s>
i know what <unk> is. </s>
mr. <unk> <unk> that <unk> are human. </s>
we can handle all the <unk> </s>
every <unk> <unk> </s>
we live in a <unk> where old people eventually move to <unk> </s>
what's your name? </s>
why are you <unk> </s>
there's another doctor here at the hospital. </s>
i think he might be better than dr. <unk> </s>
what? </s>
i'm <unk> everything that's said. </s>
he's a good man. </s>
i want a copy of her <unk> </s>
mr. <unk> </s>
mr. <unk> </s>
<unk> mr. <unk> </s>
let's do some <unk> </s>
let's get a <unk> and figure out which ones are <unk> </s>
order <unk> and <unk> vital <unk> </s>
i'm not sure what caused it, but right now, i'm pretty sure it's a <unk> </s>
the question is, what caused it? </s>
and why no <unk> </s>
if you want to do another <unk> on this, please do so. </s>
no, that won't be necessary. </s>
well, you can't just sit there and do nothing about it. </s>
<unk> </s>
we've just done a series of tests and we'll do more. </s>
it's just that right now, we're really shooting in the dark. </s>
i appreciate your <unk> doctor. </s>
but those tests took a long time, didn't they? </s>
if we stay here for a while, we might be able to <unk> him at any moment. </s>
and i'll check in and see him twice a day. </s>
i'm going to move in here with him, then, if it's
i'm afraid that's completely against hospital <unk> </s>
how much longer can you stand it? </s>
i don't know. </s>
i'm leaving once a day. </s>
<unk> </s>
i'm talking to him. </s>
i speak with my husband. </s>
i think if i stay there and i die, he will die. </s>
what are you gonna do with <unk> </s>
<unk> it's <unk> </s>
you're the only one who can stop it, john. </s>
why don't you let him go? </s>
i can't explain it to you. </s>
maybe i should be there the end of it. </s>
i don't know. </s>
to prove he was still here. </s>
to prove i was his son. </s>
what more could you possibly have done? </s>
<unk> that man got up every day of his life and went to a job he didn't like. </s>
i never trusted him. </s>
he did it because he was sick, and he had no choice. </s>
he never asked himself if he was happy or happy. </s>
i don't even know if he had the right. </s>
and when you get past this <unk> you can touch it, you can touch it. </s>
but i <unk> it. </s>
john. </s>
i was good to him, but my mother <unk> him. </s>
i can't talk right now. </s>
i did it because i had a marriage that went bad, i had a job in <unk> and i had a son that barely <unk> </s>
maybe this will be hard for me </s>
but i'm gonna be there when she dies. </s>
and i'm gonna find him, and i'm gonna cover him. </s>
and i'm gonna mark the moment. </s>
i owe him that. </s>
when did you get in town? </s>
i've never been. </s>
i'm staying with some friends. </s>
i didn't want to leave <unk> </s>
you come here every day? </s>
when you leave, a nurse is looking for me. </s>
i've been standing at least half an hour. </s>
i'm <unk> <unk> </s>

i understand that. </s>
why are you here? </s>
was there a <unk> or a car accident? </s>
he <unk> </s>

that's my dad. </s>
okay, mr. <unk> </s>
how can i leave you alone? </s>

then i better say something. </s>
are you going to starve me here? </s>
okay, we need some <unk> </s>
don't forget you haven't eaten in a long time. </s>
maybe that's why i'm here. </s>
you can't do that, <unk> </s>
all tests are <unk> vital <unk> </s>
and this is a healthy human being. </s>
i've seen people <unk> before. </s>
usually don't explain why. </s>
i have some questions about that. </s>
that <unk> <unk> </s>
like what? </s>
how are we supposed to get rid of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and talk about it? </s>
i see. </s>
you know, when we got home, it was all over this <unk> </s>
but it was <unk> <unk> it was your <unk> and your <unk> </s>

i'm serious about seeing someone. </s>
mom, it's just a <unk> </s>
the hole was <unk> but the <unk> </s>
it's a wonderful day. </s>

you've moved too fast before. </s>
i hate to think what she likes right now. </s>
don't worry about your pretty little head, <unk> </s>
you'll be safe from <unk> old jake <unk> </s>

this is the second time you've returned our <unk> to us. </s>
he's worried about us. </s>
<unk> for <unk> means he had nothing to do with it. </s>
good boy. </s>
in the meantime, get out. </s>
why don't you try listening instead of <unk> that fat mouth of yours? </s>
you were captain of the <unk> team, weren't you? </s>
at least you tried. </s>
the one where you buy the <unk> <unk> to <unk> you. </s>
i'm so proud of you. </s>
never hurts to be ready. </s>
if you think <unk> can help you, why not? </s>
i was kidding. </s>
<unk> if you want to get to know <unk> better maybe the next time you have her over for dinner you won't ask the rest of us to come along. </s>
i mean, i... </s>
it's that <unk> </s>
i don't think the others noticed. </s>
still, the last thing any of us should be doing is <unk> with each other. </s>
office <unk> even under normal <unk> </s>
we live under normal circumstances. </s>
what are the odds of any of us finding someone who can deal with the stuff that we have to deal
i don't know, maybe <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
i don't want to be alone, actually. </s>
<unk> tell him i like him. </s>
this murder happened a week ago. </s>
why are you telling me this now? </s>
how did you get these? </s>
did the police tell you this? </s>
usually they carry that out when the victim is <unk> </s>
he said she <unk> him. </s>
we were trying to make him understand. </s>
well, it worked. </s>
<unk> <unk> 20 minutes ago, look who's here. </s>
what? </s>
okay, he's nice. </s>
and who is he? </s>
are you sure it's him? </s>
i saw one of my <unk> <unk> in her face. </s>
yes, that's him. </s>
now we know why <unk> death was given to me. </s>
he died because of me. </s>
<unk> if he's somehow <unk> then so am i. </s>
<unk> </s>
hey. </s>
whatever he's doing right now, you're not responsible for this, and i'm not. </s>
but i know who you are. </s>
you're a little <unk> <unk> </s>
long day at the office. </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
i didn't write that. </s>
i know he has some power that <unk> </s>
billy definitely didn't believe me and you believed him. </s>
this <unk> is the most important part of the country. </s>
east <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> wouldn't do anything to them. </s>
it's not like some kind of <unk> <unk> </s>
stay out of trouble. </s>
i don't think the <unk> <unk> would be too good. </s>
how about we sneak in and pretend to be your <unk> </s>
all right, you wanna go next? </s>
i think we're safe here. </s>
why doesn't it surprise me that i can walk in without an <unk> </s>
as far as i'm concerned, you have a <unk> <unk> </s>
i've never hurt a woman in my life. </s>
i just love <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
really? </s>
you <unk> me. </s>
we're taking you in for <unk> </s>
<unk> read him his rights. </s>
who are you? </s>
no one. </s>
there is a woman who never liked to show you her <unk> </s>
yeah, a <unk> prison <unk> with <unk> million. </s>
yes, but for how long? </s>
an <unk> <unk> of <unk> in a demon <unk> couldn't do much, so my guess, regular <unk> not really a problem. </s>
<unk> what are you gonna do? </s>
you can't just <unk> into a police station. </s>
there's been an accident. </s>
before we tell him what <unk> did to her husband, <unk> </s>
i don't think it's a bad idea if we're not ready to visit <unk> <unk> in the hospital. </s>
the blood in the <unk> is his. </s>
not human. </s>
he's headed this way. </s>
i'll take a sample and see what sort of person billy is. </s>
i'll take care of a <unk> </s>
<unk> daily <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
i don't think you should do this. </s>
how did you <unk> </s>
i managed to get <unk> blood <unk> </s>
maybe we can figure out which demon <unk> and figure out how the <unk> works. </s>
can you get me a glass <unk> </s>
thank you. </s>
are you gonna invite me in? </s>
please, come in. </s>
i want you to tell me about <unk> </s>
<unk> tell <unk> everything. </s>
what makes you think i'd do that? </s>
after all, it's your fault. </s>
i know immediately. </s>
i don't take sides. </s>
<unk> feels responsible for this guy because he brought him back to <unk> </s>
i feel responsible because he did it to save me. </s>
in fact, you are totally responsible for it because you are a <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> is not fashion this summer. </s>
billy <unk> <unk> people. </s>
then why are you wearing a <unk> </s>
others can take hours. </s>
god, i hope <unk> isn't feeling <unk> </s>
really <unk> </s>
i have to find <unk> </s>
and i can't help you, why? </s>
do you remember the guy who used to steal your <unk> </s>
you know, what she did to me was against what? </s>
is the shape of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> every second in pain or are you just really <unk> until you die? </s>
it's about <unk> </s>
there's definitely something you can do to stop this. </s>
that your life can suddenly be destroyed by someone else. </s>
and a woman strong enough to know that <unk> <unk> will never <unk> </s>
where's <unk> </s>
i understand why <unk> have done this. </s>
there's a reason, right? </s>
how many times do you want to talk about <unk> <unk> </s>
did i wake you? </s>
probably sitting in the back telling him how to drive. </s>
you know this <unk> </s>
probably deserved it. </s>
as i was saying... </s>
<unk> <unk> here. </s>
hey, <unk> </s>
billy. </s>
i didn't know you were having a party. </s>
we agreed that you weren't gonna come here anymore after that last thing. </s>
do you want to, or should i? </s>
looks like some of the <unk> are <unk> </s>
these are probably from <unk> demon <unk> </s>
so <unk> looks like he's been trying to <unk> people out of his <unk> </s>
which means it could be <unk> or <unk> or even <unk> </s>
<unk> where's <unk> <unk> </s>
when <unk> went out, she figured out that she was out because she was sleeping with him. </s>
well, i <unk> </s>
lying to me again will be a serious problem. </s>
sit down, <unk> </s>
there's something we need to talk about. </s>
i'm sorry i didn't tell you <unk> left. </s>
however, we must make some changes around here. </s>
change can be good, i guess. </s>
no more of these <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
maybe your mom and dad never told you about what grown men go after in <unk> </s>
you can't just come in here all the time, talk like that. </s>
in fact, he forced me to take him. </s>
is that what you want? </s>
stop it. </s>
are we standing now? </s>
you <unk> your hair back and close your eyes and then join us in the <unk> </s>
you think you can do anything you want to because you <unk> </s>
no. </s>
i'll show you blood. </s>
what do you say to a woman with two <unk> </s>
nothing you already said twice. </s>
no sense of humor. </s>
honestly, i'm calling to kill that <unk> </s>
come in. </s>
you should know the rules about billy. </s>
<unk> everybody knows the rules. </s>
never leave him alone with your girl and don't let him touch you. </s>
when you want money, leave it on the table. </s>
can you explain something to me? </s>
after i said i wanted to kill <unk> why did you invite me in? </s>
you're <unk> right? </s>
billy mention me? </s>
she said a <unk> guy named <unk> would eventually come here. </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
i know what you're doing. </s>
and who you are. </s>
you <unk> me. </s>
he forced me to find you. </s>
it's like a <unk> game. </s>
you <unk> me with your <unk> <unk> </s>
but you never give up, do you? </s>
no, you keep <unk> and running. </s>
guess what, <unk> i'm not some <unk> <unk> </s>
i'm a <unk> </s>
you just showed up, didn't you? </s>
no, <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
you and <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> eat this. </s>
it's just a <unk> </s>
the real problem is <unk> </s>
why are you telling me this? </s>
do i know you? </s>
i thought we should get married. </s>
the burning <unk> <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> he tortured to get you out. </s>
i see. </s>
<unk> <unk> the lady at the <unk> needs to <unk> her with all her <unk> </s>
no, asshole. </s>
i'm here to take you back. </s>
of course, you women are the ones who sell yourself for money and <unk> but the men are just as bad. </s>
maybe even worse. </s>
the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> </s>
i'm wearing pants. </s>
you know, i'm lucky i have an arrow on my <unk> </s>
and the <unk> of using a <unk> <unk> </s>
i don't think so. </s>
you don't have the guts to do this. </s>
don't start that again. </s>
you won't hurt me. </s>
no, i won't hurt her. </s>
i won't hurt her at all. </s>
over here. </s>
i would say that <unk> hand <unk> is <unk> blood. </s>
that <unk> <unk> downstairs is <unk> blood? </s>
you mean when i take it off my hand and <unk> my <unk> </s>

one question, mr. <unk> </s>

having a beer can bring out things that don't come out on their own. </s>
like your <unk> </s>
that <unk> <unk> really hurt me. </s>
always so happy, talking about her <unk> and another <unk> and another <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
i think i just saw <unk> leave. </s>
i swear it was her. </s>
another one! </s>
what happened to <unk> <unk> </s>
i don't know. </s>
one day he came to the wrong group. </s>
sorry, i think i got the wrong time. </s>
not the time, the day. </s>
and he never came back. </s>

she told me she was coming for you. </s>
i just talked to her and she said you were great. </s>
i hate <unk> </s>
get some rest, get it done. </s>
come on! </s>
i hate <unk> too. </s>
hi. </s>
<unk> what are you doing here? </s>
<unk> doesn't work without you. </s>
you don't belong here. </s>
why? </s>
i can't help you, fool. </s>
there's a lot less <unk> </s>
<unk> </s>
why would she pay for sex? </s>
you can't have someone who really loves you. </s>
i don't want to love anyone, you understand? </s>
to find the right person. </s>
i'm not right for anyone, <unk> </s>
come on. </s>
<unk> i'm <unk> okay? </s>
i like men, don't you see? </s>
go away! </s>
go! </s>
why? </s>
i can't hear you. </s>
remember when you'd get home late and i'd pretend i was asleep and you'd fuck me anyway? </s>
yeah, i remember. </s>
i saw <unk> today. </s>
you know, normal life. </s>
okay. </s>
it'll give me something to do tomorrow. </s>
<unk> i'll be right in. </s>
you want <unk> </s>
i want you to come to bed with me. </s>
and i'm telling you i'm going to clean up first. </s>
<unk> </s>
doesn't <unk> help you deal with your brother? </s>
<unk> thinks only of themselves and perfect <unk> </s>
all they do is fuck all day long. </s>
<unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
i found <unk> <unk> on the <unk> </s>
<unk> if you believe in <unk> </s>
all kinds of <unk> <unk> </s>
come on, put it away. </s>
a <unk> </s>
come on. </s>
and one for me. </s>
good, isn't it? </s>
even as a kid, we look different. </s>
<unk> don't like football games or any of that stuff. </s>
because if you're fat and <unk> no one can explain to you why you're so <unk> </s>
nobody <unk> i didn't know i was gay. </s>
but i didn't give in to my <unk> until the special <unk> in <unk> </s>
they let me <unk> <unk> </s>
and then they gave me a <unk> </s>
there was this incredibly handsome <unk> who'd <unk> to me when i had no <unk> </s>
i don't know which made me <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> or the <unk> </s>
my first <unk> was a <unk> </s>
i'm tired of being gay. </s>
really. </s>
we're supposed to be <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
and that's not me. </s>
i can't wait all night for the <unk> </s>
go. </s>
you have to pay anyway. </s>
i'm a <unk> </s>
the worst <unk> of all time. </s>
a <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
i'm a <unk> </s>
it doesn't have to be bad. </s>
i always get in touch with something when i'm ready to <unk> </s>
that's why it's better not to run from them, but to face them and see where they lead us. </s>
because in most <unk> the answers we seek are <unk> </s>
put your hands on the <unk> </s>
close your eyes. </s>
let's all breathe together. </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
breathe, <unk> </s>
i thought it was <unk> but it was wrong. </s>
we all have <unk> </s>
the first step to find out if we want <unk> or <unk> </s>
i don't know you, but i don't like <unk> </s>
i did it on purpose to get there again. </s>
i'm <unk> </s>
what you <unk> but don't <unk> </s>
you can run, but i can't stop you. </s>
i didn't hear you, but i didn't listen. </s>
i didn't hear you, but i didn't listen. </s>
what is it you love but you love? </s>
are you doing it because you want to, or because you want to keep pretending everything's <unk> </s>
society wants you to be fat. </s>
everyone will feel better because they feel <unk> </s>
not anymore. </s>
it's time to take that first step. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
one move, <unk> </s>
but one day of <unk> isn't enough, one bottle of <unk> isn't enough. </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> gives you the support you need on the long, hard road to <unk> </s>
believe me, there's only one way to find out. </s>
let's move on to step 3. </s>
<unk> pure and clean. </s>
<unk> pounds. </s>
<unk> </s>
14 <unk> <unk> </s>
once again, <unk> <unk> <unk> </s>
shall we find ourselves a <unk> <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> bird in the <unk> </s>
i don't like big <unk> </s>
let's see. </s>
your blood pressure is higher than mine. </s>
not quite <unk> but careful. </s>
you could be a <unk> <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> </s>
it's not weird after <unk> </s>
don't worry, <unk> </s>
everything's gonna be fine. </s>
just watch your step. </s>
you were always with that girl. </s>
what did you say? </s>
nothing. </s>
what are you doing, <unk> </s>
<unk> <unk> <unk> body <unk> <unk> </s>
a sample of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for <unk> <unk> </s>
years ago this <unk> would have been <unk> for weeks. </s>
today, this <unk> will be <unk> in less than 24 hours. </s>
