michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, his brother, buster, shared his bed.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think it's appropriate for us to sleep together.
yeah, i miss mom.
i'll tell him.
i have to write an essay of at least 000 words... regarding the morality of war and the possibility of a conflict.
i'm not sure our ethical teacher would like me to cheat while writing.
so, you passed my ethics test.
in fact, it was desperate, desperate, desperate, to the teacher at gorgegemichael bethbaeerlyad.
even the hands of those who commit small crimes can be brutally chopped off.
no ring ring no ring ring no ring ring
try to remember everything she said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
the s.d.k.'s eye was on us.
your father thought it would make us look charitable.
he must have imitated my signature.
"maybe a year ago, i'll have a son who finished the peep cheese!
you must save me from this.
i'll call social services, but you need buster back.
but i can't look at him either.
i no longer have your mother's compassion and milk.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
couple of fun girls...
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm sending you an olive branch here.
yes.
by the way, when did you sleep with anyone?
meanwhile, lindsay was helping george michael with his homework.
i don't know why i'm telling you this.
i guess there's some things you can't tell your father about.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set up his teacher... to help him fulfill his motherhood.
there's nothing wrong with that.
however, i must say i'm a little offended by the fact that you don't think about me for this.
the halos can carry out this mission.
and the teachers can fulfill that mission.
you'll find the right woman one day to fulfill this mission.
but until i do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay was never so proud of what she said her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i've been telling you about.
she's really... young girl.
your date, nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
you have a moustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache.
yeah.
but gob mistook michael's kindness for sentimentality... and feels like he was competition to get involved.
because, you know, beyond adorable... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
_
and there was a surprise visit to george sr.
i read all your teachings and got all your tapes.
and i watched it all over again.
george s.r. had recently invented a series of tapes... that he'd refer to to people... to make money from the spiritual spirit that he discovered.
i also lost two kilos of your banana bluth jail bar.
i'm here to learn.
this is a good place to start.
and after michael got rid of the two girls he had an appointment with, he met lindsay in the parents' night.
hey, linds, is this my dream product... or does this place have the same plan as our kitchen floor?
i think she's really good for you.
i used to think it would make him think of his motherhood.
besides, i can't hurry up and get married just because my son wants to.
i'm miss baerly, the ethics teacher.
my goal is to help my students understand the importance of life... that could be destroyed by some insensitive insensitive trigger.
and michael got to know his son's ethics teacher.
that's the "rrrrr" thing.
you know, it's annoying.
i mean, they gave me this class after mr. daniels had a stroke.
i thought you were kidding.
no, i was just laughing because you laughed.
"rrrr!" - "rrrr!"
but, you know, maybe...
and i think i'm a moral person.
yeah.
a question for you.
can a parent-teacher invite something to drink?
or... or... or... or... or
yeah, he's dead.
i think it's because of this incident that mr. danielels had a stroke...
let's go get a drink.
yeah, maybe it'll help.
george sr was dealing with his own admirer.
i've already told you my many sins.
maybe you'll tell me some of your sins.
well, there are legal shows which express my sins.
but let's return to your sins.
tell me one of those things about... one of the things that happened in the college dorm again.
and what's going on between michael and his second date on today's date on the second date...
michael, this little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it's him.
you have to rob him to freeze to say one thing for sure.
yes, mother.
they'll take her back.
don't take off your shoes, young master.!
don't take your shoes off!
he's out of control.
who is it?
this is annyong, your father and i adopted it.
what, i'm going away for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille figured buster was worried, even jealous.
and she realized how it feels to be ignored.
annyyong is your sister's motheryong now your sister
abort.
she stays.
listen, i'll call you back.
nice driving.
are you making dinner reservations?
he made a korean.
and after the dates...
michael took a step he hadn't taken in years.
well, do you think this is a good idea?
i think it's a great idea.
mm.
that's a good idea.
but how do we sneak in without waking everyone up?
this may not be my best idea yet.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry, michael, but it looks like we're even now.
you took someone i loved.
so i got someone you love.
i said'nashbashbagerlajam'
listen, i know you're trying to get back at me for the marta thing.
i was lying to you when i told you i wouldn't try to sleep her, so...
she has to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
i'm lucky i got rid of him.
no problem.
so romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden"?
hi, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but i have to say i don't know if it's real first.
but now... your morality teacher...
yeah, i did it for her.
oh.
she loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, i'm pretty sure you're interested in her on the subject.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show her that i care about her.
about the class?
i mean, i don't think he likes her saddam...
hi, george michael.
i'll go home and think about this.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was she doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with him.
so, why did he do that?
why did she sleep with my moral teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new...
he's not one of the good snipers targeting his target, and he's almost everywhere.
you know, but listen, did you really think he was...?
i mean, she's old for you, don't you think she's old?
we don't even know how old she is.
nobody knows.
well, she was in a different dance... and i was just gonna go to her, messing around with her, and i thought i'd...
"hey, you wanna dance?"
and i thought she was gonna say, "what's gonna happen?" okay?
i did it different across the mirror, but...
but, you know, like, we were dancing in a joke, or something.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should go out with your own age?
like your cousin.
i've stumbled upon a book that was difficult to find a picture of saddam's bath suite.
"what would sadam do?"
yeah.
yeah, you know something?
okay, that's the same as our fire escape.
in prison, george sr. was preparing for the evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon is making his own arrangements.
how we doing?
we have a video.
and when george michael was still angry with gob... he called the family expert on making trouble.
i know you're dating shannon.
that cheerleader?
yeah, he'll probably take her to one of those stupid different dances.
i wish i could bring someone to shock everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels... and i asked him... but he breathed and dropped the phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe we should both go.
right, i mean, it was a bad example...
hello.
my mother took him.
he's got me registered to do school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the situation with miss bearly and george michael.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in her.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality...
see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, she's like she's in love with you, so...
she knows we're out.
i told him you slept with my brother.
this could be the most immoral thing i've ever heard in my life.
well, you've only been a morality teacher for half a semester.
look, it was a preemptive move.
my brother was gonna try to sleep with you.
so, i want to leave you right now, and i'm not going back to you.
i understand.
starting now.
she went for a walk with george sr. cindi.
george.
and she's getting to know him.
you can make me feel completely comfortable here.
it's weighing on my soul.
you...
he's pushing the camera.
i'm taking a grandmother to the dance, so this is your dinner, so it's away with mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy.
watch your back, my immigration little brother!
and the different spring dance was in the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting her in because she doesn't have strong square jaws... with your perfectly flaw-shaped nose like you.
wanna dance?
all right!
gob finally found shannon he was looking for...
gob knew he was cheating on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon!
hi, lisa.
shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i messed up our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about it for a long time, and-and...
that's... that's the right thing to do.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing at a high school dance?
i'm only here with my girlfriend.
yeah, my moral teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
after i treated you so badly, you were really to protect me.
in fact, gob mistook michael's morality teacher... with knowledge of citizenship.
man, she... she understands.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a citizenship teacher.
second move.
i was seeing mrs. baerly, and i never should have brought gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked her, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to it.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with children.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed about some sad things, but...
i don't think we'll have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm getting this cake.
hey, you want to dance?
i can't believe this is working.
next arrested in developement.
buster screws.
stop, stop, stop, stop!
there are no candles here.
mom would freak.
no, it's okay.
i light my candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
no problem.
right here, let me help you.
these?
okay, i'll carry it here for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is something really extreme.
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we'll all go one day, won't we?
four months ago, each of you joined a refuge, to join a never-before-seen tv show.
and guess what?
you win.
i think some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, just like the sun.
hi, i'm randall, and i'm a total gay guy and i'm proud of it.
you're cute, aren't you?
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel from england.
me too.
that's my brother, stanton, on parole officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him over the head.
she doesn't know.
but i do.
dixon, 0'0", 000 pounds.
people say i look like will smith.
they look like barack obama these days.
each of you will earn $00,000, all you have to do is spend one night in this prison.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
fuck!
cool.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know it's not a prank?
right.
it's our third show, but we're not gonna run until the fall.
to find out if this is a prank, you're gonna have to play the game and earn the money.
you will be asked to carry out a series of duties.
the missions will force your boundaries, your courage and your thinking.
that sounds fun, right?
what kind of assignment are they, man?
make up your mind now.
i'm in.
where am i signing?
i didn't have a girlfriend to admit it even when she was high.
i need to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you're out of your mind.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
walk around.
you'll notice.
money equals between survivors, but if you get the night out, there's a rich prize.
no money can spend the night here.
anyone else want to join him?
i'm not.
there's no way i'm going to the city with this piss boy that i'm
i'm in.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you guys are idiots.
it's a fucking party joke, they're gonna fuck you all up.
you don't look like a bunch of idiots.
can't you see this is a recording party?
or be famous.
there's a human head there!
don't worry, it's not real.
looks pretty real to me.
that's why they call our job special effects.
isn't it lovely?
it's a little sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thanks to our reward special effects team.
follow me, friends.
in the hot swamp water, lazy crocodiles are waiting for their prey.
india crocodiles become long and benevolent faces.
such crocodators...
guys.
i see you're working hard as always.
ready?
we're all set.
and absolutely.
keep it up.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great to scare them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are going to the show.
you looked really scared.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, looking at this place, it gives me the creeps.
did you know that?
the dead homeless?
of course.
why didn't you say anything?
that must be a big coincidence.
do you think it's really safe there?
it's safe enough for show insurance.
any more questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's do this.
okay.
we're rolling.
each of you has been chosen by your own free will, to spend the night in jail, to earn $00,000 each.
clear enough, isn't it?
all right, let's get this party started.
you can find anything you need at your base camp, that's the director's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you've got everything we've got, so how can we write it?
go down the corridor, turn right, right, right, then left.
head to the stairs, left, right, and another left.
do you want me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
there you will find a key to get you off your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll wait and see.
i thought leaving the basement was awful.
have fun, inmates.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to duty.
can you not do that?
i can't see a damn thing in here.
anybody remember where we're going?
go flat, right, then left.
no, go straight, two right, then left.
there was so much going on.
no, go straight down the corridor, straight down,
"give back, make it right again, and left.
"then straight down the stairs,
"sola, right, and left again."
what are you?
smart.
ilylet, it's gonna be a great show.
careful.
careful.
god.
what is this place?
and be ready.
it was fun.
let's speed them up a little.
okay, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
the power's running out, the generator should have come in already.
damn it!
hurry!
strange, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's freezing in here.
look, the key.
yeah.
okay.
look, people.
yeah, come on.
great.
all right, you.
who is this?
i think it's the warden.
take this.
okay, yeah.
look at this.
what, man?
"hello, brave contestants.
"welcome to the warden clem harvis office.
"there's a box in the middle of the room.
"this chess stones will determine your personal role.
"you can't trade with the other contestants.
"the jacks were his favorite."
now it's your turn to put your hand in the box.
shit.
well, who wants first?
me.
what's going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black castle.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
fuck!
that was really crazy.
my little piggies, welcome to duty.
now let me tell you about the pennyville state prison.
in 0000, with the cost of crisis in 0000, the cruel warden thought to increase his fortune by destroying some expenses.
these were the prisoners!
00 prisoners were executed until the warden's crimes were exposed.
the last person who was sentenced to death here was principal harvis himself.
rumor has it the director's still walking through the halls.
you will be asked to face the principal tonight and face tortured souls under this building.
first mission.
white queen.
try not to die!
does anyone want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
"the white queen must go to the church of prison to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first corridor.
that sounds awesome.
thanks.
damn it!
what happened?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see anything.
okay, calm down, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung the babies!
children...
i guess they're all covered with speaker phone.
voices are more effective than images to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
god!
that sounds lovely.
no, i'm fine, man.
crazy bastard.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
something came up.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're calling from the speaker, randall.
really.
okay.
oh, my...
nice set.
they want you to turn off the flashlight.
okay?
open the bible marked page...
"you will find the lord's prayer there.
"there has been disrespect for this place that was sacred 00 years ago,
"and now this is the office of extraordinary events."
oh, it's the opposite."
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do this.
"when you complete your mission...
"if there's no sign of the director,
"get back to camp."
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry about who i'm bothering.
it wasn't my idea.
okay.
" protect us from evil...
"our father in the sky...
"do not let evil rule us.
"protecting us all...
"as we forgive those who owe us, forgive us our debts.
"give us our daily bread today.
"as in heaven...
"as in the sky,
"because rule and rule is yours."
please tell me i can leave now.
"before i go camping,"
god, randall, you need to blow out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look at what they're made for money.
where'd she go?
i understand that those who did this job had cut off our connection to our homo friend for a while to give a more frightening weather.
whatever.
absolutely, it went very well.
guys?
i think we did something awesome.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, dude, it's not that bad.
definitely not worth the money.
but the mission was worth money.
thank god i'm finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it again.
they can serve you again.
no kidding.
i swear you don't even know how people feel there.
it's like walking in a busy fog, only cold like ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next.
what do you mean?
"some cameras don't work"?
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated.
let's send scelzi down and have a look, you're on.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
either we talk or i'm gonna go or i'm gon
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i had a little research done.
you mean, "don't fuck" and those town girls?
am i right?
big lips, wide hips, taylor.
okay, so prison isn't just for men?
is there a women's department?
and that goddamn crazy principal wouldn't answer anybody if she'd just walk around the women's section.
beat them, rape them, get them pregnant, and starve to death.
some people say they feed their own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this true story will improve the show!
everyone could be talking about us.
that's nothing compared to the story you made up.
me too.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do that, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
really?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they do.
good.
scelzi, what is that?
it's just a little something to get me through the night.
want some?
get your hairy ass here now, okay?
aye, aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the hell out of me.
i got a great stuff.
suit yourself.
we're fully ready to begin.
i can tell you my biggest fear is being buried alive.
where am i going now?
"this will set you free."
okay,
i'm at the end of freedom.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
fuck!
what?
blood.
it's not real blood.
no mold, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me you're going upstairs, not downstairs.
i'm sorry.
00 steps?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down there, you're gonna see a finger door.
he says...
damn it!
welcome to cell number five.
"if we think of the violence and insanity of violence and insanity,
shit.
tell me what to do... and i'll get out of this hell right now.
no!
thanks.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, " if a prisoner can't commit suicide, if a prisoner can't,
"now you will be sentenced to a prisoner."
okay, where's the pit?
under your feet.
this place is full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult mission.
"what are you gonna do when you're in the hole."
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my mission.
connie.
what?
check this out.
what?
no... no...
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back, and i specifically told you that you add something to the show, and you ask me why you're fired?
this is not our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you have to get that guy out, okay?
she's gonna ruin the show.
damn it!
we'll be ruined.
and you didn't bring this?
cut it out, no.
very clear.
what's open?
come closer.
i asked you why you put a camera in the control room.
yeah.
camera footage... they want to record... what they want to...
wow!
wow!
you're right.
it's brilliant, isn't it?
absolutely brilliant.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to record how you scare us by putting things into the show?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
three.
black king and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you'd be back on duty.
wiseass.
okay, black king and white horse go right and go to the gas chamber.
the white queen and the black horse go straight, and they go to the prison kitchen.
okay, later.
good luck.
"the hawk and horse first turn left and turn right.
"and ride out to the end of the corridor,
"and get down the stairs."
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, pick up.
we're in.
"welcome to the gathering room.
there must be a light in the wall behind you, turn it on.
"black king and white horse go into the gas chamber."
nice set, connie.
it deserved the best there, it was a real place.
it's the only place the law firm cleansed.
isn't it beautiful?
pretty creepy.
god.
what's that smell?
a documented true execution rooms often carry the smell of death itself.
of course, the smell is not your death.
if a man knows that his life has come to its final moments, his anxious anxiety is caused by an epidemic which gives him plenty of scent.
in this case, the human smell we're breathing now is the smell of gas that kills him.
now for fun, ladies and gentlemen.
the black king is sitting in the chair.
black king?
that would be me.
wait for further instructions.
"there you will find some meat and some chicken.
you'll cook this meat and eat it.
man!
inmates have always eaten meat cow, pig...
"or that there is no lamb or another meat...
"and they suspected it.
"they thought it was a pleasant meat they never tasted before."
you mean human flesh, right?
are you in?
yeah.
guess what you're gonna do now?
i gave up.
you're gonna connect toni.
i'm telling you, toni should fully experience the fear of the prisoners just before gassing gas.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends had some weird wishes.
are you okay?
okay.
"your duty is to...
"before you kill the main van to find the main van and cut the gas."
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$000 to vomit.
okay.
strange.
i can't do this.
i can't.
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
no more donkey jokes.
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they'll pay the extra money."
do it for the team, girl.
vomit?

god!

cheeky.
muscle.

i don't know, con. this guy's starting to freak me out.
stop playing games.
let me out.
how's it going?
we need to talk to you.
outside?
yeah.
i have big news.
i think the company's playing us.
what?
who's there?
who are you?

and what are we gonna do with the castle teller?
where are they?
i don't know, just give me a second.
there.
see that guy again?
wow!
who's that?
okay, how could she have got here so fast?
isn't that the guy in the picture?
yeah.
yeah, she looks like him.
nice.
no, not cool.
this guy either can cross the walls or there's more than one man.
we've all been watching "prtij"?
mind if we pass?
please?
guys?
guys?
fake blood, fake.
they did good.
maybe even oscar.
no.
no, that's not true.
it's completely out of the script.
sounds real to me.
connie, they're playing us.
trust me.
what?
look.
they copied the picture.
what?
acting.
clothes.
easy.
stop.
no.
no.
he's a real ghost.
i can't translate any more.
if it gets any further, my view will be out of sight.
what?
this is a big prison.
i can't put cameras everywhere.
show me the pit.
show me the gas chamber.
taylor, somebody better go over there and see if they're okay.
i can tell they don't look good.
he's acting.
then where's scelzi?
i don't know.
she's probably hiding somewhere.
i'll call the office.
okay, you too.
good night.
they don't know what happened.
i feel bad.
okay, i'll go and prove it to you.
no problem.
anyone?
i'm coming.
i'll get my camera, see if i can get some good footage.
thank you.
you have to be nice to them.
you'll make it snappy!
you're gonna be okay.
you know what?
you really are photogenic.
you're funny, kid.
i want to do my duty now.
lock the air.
come on.
connie, what do you want to do?
stop the game.
wow, this place looks haunted, right?
it's getting a little weird.
where did he go?
i don't know.
i didn't see him.
it's headed this way.
not here.
what was that?
yeah, what was that?
shit.
taylor?
put angel on screen.
we have to get them out of there.
can you hear me?
listen to me.
there's been some changes in the plan.
we need to stop the show.
what?
why?
i'll be honest with you.
there's another person with you.
who?
we're not sure.
i want you to get out there as fast as possible, okay?
playing games with me?
you're trying to scare me.
open the door.
i want to win and get my money.
open this door!
who opened the door?
sorry, you're not serious, are you?
idiot!
your mission is to memorize and locate the cell seven that are marked.
lucky!
in this cell, director harvis has been wounded deadly by a prisoner.
you'll find a key in that cell, this key will free your friend in the hole and the gas chamber.
great.
was that all?
it was the easiest money i've ever made.
what am i scared of?
nothing.
angel!
stanton?
help!
well, now it's out of my sight.
hello?
who's there?
hello?
angel?
angel.
let me down.
who are you?
angel?
angel!
what... what... what... what...
it's not real.
let me down.
wait.
it's you.
no!
angel, are you okay?
he killed my brother.
he's gonna kill me too.
he killed my brother.
new jersey school of acting.
not bad for someone like me, is it?
connie, are you there?
yeah.
how could you organize this?
we had a hard time.
it's gonna be a great show.
i'll see you later.
do i take this shit first?
you're such an asshole.
you said you wanted a great show, didn't you?
you got what you wanted.
yeah.
solve toni, i'll take dixon and stanton.
okay, snow, we're cutting.
people get cleaned up and change.
prepare for pati and champagne.
excellent acting.
show's over.
toni?
good job, dixon.
okay, dixon.
it's over, buddy.
are you okay?
stop playing, snow.
you got something to say?
we have to get them out of there.
we have to get them out of there.
get it out of my face!
fight new coordinates: 0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0

if you can't figure it out, you'll lose as a punishment.

london, the package should have been in cia custody 00 minutes ago.
our aircraft is waiting.
it's a good thing our guest wouldn't be in a hurry.
traffic tower says they're moving in five minutes.
the home secretary's closets have been compromised.
we're gonna have to be a little more creative about our funding.
where the hell is oliver?
where's the pilot protection?
you can break the rules, but you need a special order.
something must be done.
director general.
i know you don't like hearing this from a politician, but reform is coming.
do you know that elevator is just for emergency?
guard 0, what's your status?
are you restless, juney?
you'd be a lot less nervous if you just kept being my london boyfriend.
that position won't be open for long.
i spy with my little eye beginning with this letter...
engines are going for the final speed.
put them on the screen.
calum, nearest police units?
whatever we got, come on.
code 0!
attack!
god.
june, for god's sake, don't.
get out, now!
the deadly force has been allowed to use it.
open the van or everyone dies!
open the van, now!
pearce.
americans crucify us.
your operation, harry.
say again, command post?
lower your weapons and release qasim.
what the fuck are you doing, harry?
open the doors!
open the doors!
go, go, go!
control, the prisoner has escaped!
heading north!
no, no!
keaton!
command post, agent's chasing down five foot years.
any other footage?
follow her.
the nearest armed unit is five minutes away.
helicopter's 00 miles away.
barriers?
in position.
the other side of the tunnel is the last straw.
they have nowhere to go.
sco00 to 0 minutes.
go.
lead two, report.
ed, wait.
lead two, report.
i repeat, the cia liaison officer has been shot.
agent 0, do you see qasim?
command post, i heard a vehicle.
they shut everything down.
it's over.
the bbc can confirm that the us terrorist leader adam qasim has escaped from mi0 custody in one of the most serious mistakes in the history of the organization.
apparently, the security motorcade transporting qasim was attacked on the shelf northolt route.
you call it murder, not war, but in the west streets.
because in new york, in washington, you didn't want this in london.
but neither did pakistan's children.
when they get shot by drone airplanes, they call it murder.
qasim offers a new kind of threat.
so far, he hasn't targeted civilians.
our models show a 00% chance of an attack within 00 hours.
the more pressure gets under, the smaller the window.
i can't say that with the tape record...
the secretary of state is coming tomorrow.
we serve the british people, not washington.
if that's not true, we're already done.
the americans think we no longer serve purpose.
we need a head.
i'll be relieved of duty in the morning.
haven't you heard anything about qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, what happens to me if you get out?
you're out.
no one else knows you're in qasim's web.
just get out.
will holloway?
drive.
how's life after mi0?
you're not from the moscow branch.
london needs you.
is there anyone you should say goodbye to?
thank you.
we know harry's connection to your family, so we understand this may not be easy for you.
even if he's dead, it's okay.
harry's too arrogant to kill himself.
he was pretending to kill himself.
she went to her grave.
love of your life.
harry's team has noticed a change in harry's attitude since the woman died.
she's emotionally distant, cold, started drinking high amounts of alcohol.
the water would be below 0 degrees.
he'd have hypothermia before he got to the bank.
this is the picture you said that was taken after you jumped in before you entered this square.
before he disappeared, harry made four encrypted phone calls.
your old emergency message box.
why did she call you?
i have no idea.
i talked to him the last time he picked me up from mi0.
she wants to talk right now.
that makes you useful.
can you help us find her?
no, thanks.
and you, harry, you talk a lot about berlin?
the night your father died?
if there's anything else, mace, i have a right to know.
i don't think i can...
if you're not really gonna kill him, i think you told me what you wanted to tell him.
find harry, so you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
i thought i was taking that title to the grave.
recently, the anti-terrorist director for her majesty's security service.
funny, but who are you really?
one who knows what these two words mean to you.
asma shishani.
go.
how did you find me?
what do you want?
i know someone did it on my side.
they never told me who they were.
of course not, but you must have had a connection.
a phone number, that's all.
the phone number will work.
in return, i'll give you what you want.
impossible.
she said she was a human rights lawyer.
your government helped them after i put my two brothers in jail.
but after i was released, she became too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if she's an agency, she's not one of us.
then don't be a problem, tell me again it doesn't matter to you.
keep her alive, she's the guarantee i'll keep my word.
i don't need a guarantee.
take her to a hospital, or the deal's off!
what she needs is mercy.
no!
she has a daughter.
and you sent him after me?
you put him in danger and now you refuse to save him from pain?
what kind of man are you?
don't send the video to her parents.
harry... harry... harry harry... harry
you have a deal.
the bbc says there's no progress on the arrest of the fugitive terrorist adam qasim.
the national threat level is critical, so there's an attack on the hand tower.
in the economy news, the ftse 000 fell again this morning, and sterlin continued to breathe the euros and other funds.
there's a new intel on harry.
he's got a pre-priced mistake we've been driving to kent coast.
holloway, this is confidential information.
we found traces of explosive there, too.
you've known him longer than all of us.
do you think it's possible that qasim somehow got harry involved?
take her with you?
i don't know.
anyway, you find harry, we find qasim.
anything for holloway?
here.
tomorrow, 00.
park in 0 a, 0 a.
then open your eyes.
i hope you come alone.
just for protection.
if you can't get a crazy cold war purple without hitting us, we're seriously in trouble.
i promise.
it says not yet.
we're playing this game through harry's way till we see him.
copy that.
doors opening.
drive.
ground floor.
doors opening.
open sightings, multiple exits.
repeat, holloway.
things harry needs for a meeting to arrange.
yes, mr. holloway, your uncle said he'd meet you at the coffee shop.
she left her cell phone at home.
the guy in the parking lot, get rid of him.
she should be wearing an mi0 shirt.
listen to me.
stop underestimating harry.
don't think you'll endanger your men.
wait for the signal...
what is it, alpha 0?
holloway?
holloway, where are you going?
wait.
no, we're not there.
don't move.
holloway, don't move!
terminal 0b.
doors closing.
she booked me a flight.
pa000, the glow plane.
i'm going tolasow.
call the douglasow office.
get me the airport police.
priority code sigma nine.
the police want an open road to the terminal.
and get us clearance for heathrow security.
(000, passengers of the glasgow plane...
holloway, don't get in the air.
what am i doing here, harry?
i should have found someone outside the service i could trust.
it's a short list when you go drunk, crazy and dead.
to be honest, the only person i can call friend is someone who thinks i ruined your life.
qasim's escape was arranged by someone at the service's top.
by one of the people who want you to follow me.
that's why i had to get lost.
qasim was holding it.
he's our only connection to the traitor.
once it's in the system, it'll be shut.
he's planning an attack.
someone is trying to destroy the service itself.
you're crazy.
ruth's death...
don't!
look, that's all i want.
what are you waiting for, harry?
mi0 was everything to me, and you took it from me, for nothing.
hate me all you want, but i think you believe in service.
what happened in berlin?
did they fool you like that?
this may not end up like you expected.
i'm afraid i've gotta get them something off the lining.
nothing there, but they'll have to check it out.
i'll send you a number.
call me in 00 hours, please.
i'm a security service.
hands behind your back!
you just let him go.
calm down, francis.
we don't want you to have a heart attack.
the deadly one.
mi0 now looks like a complete liability, and i'm the last friend in the government of mi0.
i mean, you need to be really good to me right now.
in other words, is she crazy?
it's not contradictory with his final three psychological evaluations.
she refused to join.
harry pearce hasn't stopped being.
as crazy as it is, i'll still catch him...
for example.
he wanted me to help him get lost.
didn't it occur to you to accept your request and bring her to us?
just because your life hasn't been shit since harry kicked you out doesn't mean we can't put your life in a fucking mess right now.
since we threatened each other, neither three of you have been hanging from a cliff or something.
your entire organization appears to be disabled now.
find qasim.
fully loaded.
they're ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i saw this name working on a case.
i thought they got you off duty.
they got it.
now what really happened?
kidnapping may have been arranged by someone in the service.
you know anything about that?
what are you looking for?
i left it two weeks ago.
there must be one around here.
tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't apply.
when i was 00, i was hanging out with a kid who makes money transfers.
k section was interested in some people using this, so they got to me.
you started as an agent?
and when i was done, they asked me to train as an officer.
when i told you, my family came back to me.
and if someone you worked for helped qasim escape, that would be a problem, wouldn't it?
all right.
something felt wrong that day.
robass, my team leader, he was in front with me.
he told me not to open the weapons compartment.
he ordered me to chase him.
where does she live?
loaded.
w00.
panama city.
service fund.
june, what are you...
who are you?
you told me not to chase qasim.
you told me not to chase when i acted on my gun.
we swore an oath, rob.
i'm not saying anything until we get to thames house.
we're not going to thames house.
will, what did you find?
qasim's guards were deliberately weakened.
the team leader was in on it.
he's just a shoemaker.
find out who gave the order.
americans think mi0 is a weak link, and i think one of them is joining them.
when qasim ran away, we fell out of our sight.
the cia has taken it completely.
fire... fire... fire... fire...
he was gonna shoot.
his pulse...
dead, dead.
he's dead.
listen.
you should go home.
june!
i'll take care of this, but you have to go, now.
i've never heard of a piece killed with a song like that.
who's warrender's dirty shot?
landon miller.
agency hawk.
he's trying to secure his continued support, hopefully he doesn't give away the keys to the kingdom.
every time i see you, francis, you seem to be buried another inch or two deeper in the recesses of some swivel-eyed cow from langley or pentagon.
you don't have to tell me.
i think at times like these, we shouldn't forget who's swinging the flag.
francis.
i'm trying to help, but he's officially accusing me of doing business for the cia.
tonight, your generals, your politicians, your spies met for a celebration.
tonight, we strike at the heart of their power.
our enemy, your sons and daughters, the politicians who send your illegal battles to die.
spies who spy on you like you are criminals.
this war is beyond religious differences.
all flights out of the united kingdom, flying across the united kingdom...
you had it.
warrender lived.
if you have a way to get to qasim, tell me now.
there's another way.
qasim's wife.
asma shishani.
the fsb has her.
if i find out where they're holding her, she gives the traitor.
you made a deal with her.
yeah.
and if we succeed, it will lead us right to him.
surrender and set it up.
how do you know the russians have women?
in exchange for a defective cia agent stuck in moscow.
i can get you away, but you need to open the secret door.
it's an ip address.
you're kidding.
it's the only way, will.
harry's getting help from somewhere.
i've seized your old contacts, but i need access to personnel files to do this properly.
but it won't take you anywhere exciting though.
in position.
looks like i'm gonna have to steal more extra bandwidth.
the drink.
malcolm?
all right, i'm in.
i'm looking at the servers now.
harry, we gotta go.
can't we do this faster?
i can do it.
but unfortunately, this machine is from a century ago.
_
erin watts.
might be worth a closer look.
fill the blanks for me.
but an agent was exposed.
i almost got him out.
i was a colleague for less than a year.
or they're making you choose late.
all right, i'll leave you alone.
is it?
am i sure?
i'm sorry, will.
harry.
harry!
harry, what have you done?
stay away from the computer.
i've never felt compelled to say this before, but i hope you know what you're doing.
harry works with qasim?
a whole gchq data archives has stolen.
everything we have on our western agent friends in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
she showed up on the schrefield airport cctv.
i don't know.
harry didn't do that cyber attack alone.
then who's helping her?
except you.
and you're still protecting him.
why?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i'll find him.
and there's a threat.
analysis says there's gonna be a large scale attack within 00 hours, multiple targets.
an agent in charge of qasim's escape is missing.
there's signs of struggle at home.
you know anything about that?
how's your mother, holloway?
i heard it wasn't very good.
he hasn't been packed since your dad died.
understandable, really.
and then that door work comes.
i know, i know.
harry was right about something.
you're not good enough.
home secretary, can we really hope qasim will stop attacking again?
we've destroyed the threats of our freedom and our lifestyle.
your ability to hurt us may be important, but it's the end.
you'll learn that we have no limits.
they're not listening.
they never killed our women?
we're making the world a better place, brother.
the transplant team is in position at the airport.
we have a warrant by the atc to block the road to the prisoner if necessary.
i guess i owe you one.
you were absolutely right about vass.
danke.
alexanderplatz.
it's the northeast corner by the metron in'00.
we have a safe house.
call it nostalgia.
don't forget to bring the archives.
don't forget to bring his wife.
how did you find me?
there's only one place in berlin to interview.
you told me.
northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
no emotionality.
it's the price of qasim's wife.
when the lady fsb gets out of custody, qasim will give me a number.
and he will take me to the renegade.
where it's vulnerable to take this, they're gonna destroy the service.
get in the car, harry.
there's an old hotel 00 minutes away.
my contact can meet us there with three clean passport passport.
you're going home.
i'm sorry about this.
why are you here, mrs. keaton?
keep walking, harry.
i killed someone because of you.
you're c0.?
what are you doing, harry?
talent discovery.
so which one of you found it?
jesus, will.
everything is ready.
and vass?
when you came to my house, i called it in.
i said someone was asking about qasim's escape.
they tied me to the command center, and they told me what to do.
they went to vass's house before us and planted the evidence.
i've arranged vass's escape.
you think i want to do it?
i know my mission.
i'm the only one who knows.
you were set up.
she's right, will.
but i wonder if miss keaton is sure about me.
it was a secure command chain.
what was i supposed to do?
do you believe him?
yeah.
i'm sure your men will come and find you if your usefulness is still available.
what did you think they would do to you after all this?
i did what they wanted from me.
we're changing the deal.
we're taking qasim's wife to london.
tell him he can't come to the trade himself or he'll never see his wife again.
let's go get her.
what happened to alexanderplatz?
sudden agoraphobia.
i'm afraid there was something wrong with qasim's wife.
at least make yourself useful to put it in my car.
harry.
colonel.
i hate to be unkind, but we're gonna need your clothes.
while the search for adam qasim is intensifying the search for the united kingdom's national ray line, everyone who's travelling at the validation and must enter the governor's control.
i got your wife.
let me talk to him.
the russians put him to sleep and...
bullshit.
i'm bringing your wife to london.
no.
i'll tell your whore you said goodbye.
was the baby thing too much?
no, you're the same.
i trusted june.
you were right to relieve me of duty.
despite everything i've done, you're still trying to do something good here.
i won't let your sacrifices get in vain.
it was here.
was it fast?
she could have left me, but she chose not to.
you try anything, anything, i can't guarantee anyone's safety.
nobody's.
you bring my wife, i'll give you your phone number.
here we go.
hello?
holloway.
this message came from the h department.
me.
we can catch qasim, but we need help.
and let's go.
one clean choice, hannah.
trust me, and help me.
or leave.
do good or do well, right?
shit.
they're approaching the location.
what i wrote last night is upgrading the self-replicating algorithm to reconsider all potential looks.
so sudoku doesn't cut?
please.
all right, we're here.
how much time do we have?
i'm looking at 000 cameras.
give me something.
as soon as she realizes we're playing with her, she's gone.
wait.
she worked 00 seconds ago.
are you sure?
yeah, confirmed.
the camera was disabled in the last minute.
third floor roof, east corner.
harry, we have to stall.
i have to hope you're looking at us.
yes?
try the south.
i have his wife.
you were supposed to look south.
give me the number.
give me the number or we'll leave.
turn around or you die.
here.
him too.
not yet.
you have 0 seconds to turn around.
turn.
maybe this guy never saw her.
almost there.
him?
kill.
give me the number.
don't!
stop!
no!
okay?
will, she's fine.
shooter's dead.
then it's over.
malcolm, feather.
yes?
my wife is dead, isn't she?
harry, listen.
hannah should let us know.
harry?
hannah, why did harry take off the headphones?
i don't know.
let us know.
bring sco00.
four trucks full of rdx are leaving limehouse north industrial park within the next 00 minutes.
how do you know?
qasim just told me.
trucks full of bombs leaving in 00 minutes.
i think we got him.
let's go!
armed police!
stay where you are!
clear!
clear!
eyes on the main target?
negative!
negative!
negative, sir.
command post, area clear.
harry.
he sold his own men.
why would he do that?
what did you do?
armed police!
freeze!
move!
you have to tell them everything, harry.
i think we have a lot to talk about.
this may be out of line.
since the southwest corner of alexanderplatz.
keep your eye on holloway.
make sure she's safe.
maybe we're not in such a hurry.
did you find qasim?
harry will talk.
you still don't know him.
qasim gave up his entire operation.
what did you say to her?
i should have thought they'd let you out after berlin.
they want to offer you a deal.
throw it all over harry and go.
i told them i'd quit after i did.
there's no way out.
i can't.
there's an emergency backup key that's wrapped around your neck.
whatever you're up to...
what would ruth think?
what did you give him?
check the back.
southwest corner.
i found harry in the northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
the opposite.
where you trap someone.
harry?
i gave it to her.
get down!
get down!
get down!
lock us up.
get down!
get down!
we're not here for you!
we're here for them.
get down!
think of your families.
hamza.
why?
there are 00 men on the other side of these doors.
you must surrender.
come here.
open up!
if you think we're negotiating...
open the door.
but he'll kill us.
there are so many demons in a room.
the only way out of here alive is to surrender...
you think i want out?
how many people in this room have had their lives ended?
my people's lives.
your people?
you didn't ask them to talk, to kill for them.
if you want a hostage...
i think he made it clear he wasn't interested in hostages.
i'm the director of mi0.
kill me and put the gun down.
otherwise, you're nothing but a dead terrorist.
no one will see you as a hero.
when we're done, you'll be a drunk, stubborn, powerless heathener who beats his wife.
we'll give them free tickets to disneyland in exchange for saying that a couple of marrakech men go forward and begged them to pee on it.
we can't remember you very well, can we, adam?
wait, wait, wait.
i pulled the helicopter back.
but...
you fucking coward.
i thought you were fighting a higher standard.
i'm sorry about your wife's death, adam.
i know what this can do to you.
is this supposed to stop me?
it's okay.
stop!
why did you bring him here?
i made a choice.
without plan b.
why do you think i kept you out of the room?
people are still dead, harry.
less than the ones who will die in the explosions.
how could you make such a choice?
it's my job.
auntie, can you come out and play?
hello, geraldine.
finally, it comes down to who says the longest lie.
right?
if we had protected that morning, qasim would have never escaped.
you gave met's air unit an order to turn down all mi0 requests for all of it?
that's the advantage of being a maniac.
i don't need to prove it.
sacrificing his own service so he can be questioned by a foreign power.
the americans would have made you the general director, no doubt.
how many more lives was that promotion worth?
what did you think you did, harry?
the service is dying.
but if i had given up the moment i realized i was on the losing side, my career would be too short.
blowing my brains out and finding my 00-year-old nephew...
i think this came from you.
what is this?
the subtle intestines more than an hour or an unstoppable bleeding.
there's no mark.
how clever.
i was afraid that would be your answer.
so i got your chance to choose.
it's not the lunch that makes you sick.
i had a cattle rib too.
tell me you're lying, harry.
please.
tell me you didn't betray your country.
it's been five hours, geraldine.
you can spend the last two hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd play with your beautiful niece.
i'm thinking.
your message said you'd tell me something.
they're watching ruth's grave.
you can't leave now.
i actually have something that you should be.
your father was wearing this the night he died.
stasi pulled out everything that could work, and found a way to get into the fsb archives somewhere.
she was wearing a wedding ring on the night of her operation?
i didn't kick you out because you're not good enough.
after your father, i couldn't...
i should have protected you.
the good ones don't last forever, will.
then who will?
they're like me.
if you know your problem and tell the men at the door, it'll help a lot.
there's room for every guest at hotel junior high school.
assemble in one line.
these new problems kill in the dark.
these people will be grateful to you when the darkness falls.
i think we should keep them here to keep them safe, but i'm worried things get worse.
they have no idea who caused the dark problem.
and it's not what hides in the dark that we need to worry about.
we still haven't figured out how to lift that fog wall yet.
maybe this is a blessing.
this was the latest from in-flight safati.
i'm on your side and i might need a new job.
i'm under control, but if i can get another pillow for my beauty sleep, it'll be appreciated.
try to fix things.
we talked about this.
it's almost impossible to eliminate the problem without killing someone with a problem.
of course, i just need materials that aren't available to me, materials that are impossible to provide, and maybe i need information that doesn't exist.
i'm gonna need a team.
any idea what happened?
but there's a bad element.
it's the only way to protect the rest of us.
it's risky to drive because of the magnet problem.
an engineer to help repair the power plant.
she volunteered as soon as she knew.
if things don't work out, you can use her problem for the operator.
what the hell are you doing?
the unsanctioned killer is out there somewhere.
and she really wants to prove to you that she wants to help.
okay, well, whatever the reason, just keep an eye on her for me, okay?
because neither of us is immune to new problems.
i'm not just saying it's because it's my mom
i'll call the person who caused the dark trouble at school when you're gone.
he stole those batteries and put us in danger.
there was no other choice, dwight.
this is the third case in two weeks.
now the serial killer is in this building.
all right, i'm gonna go talk to dwight.
my father always said you were a good man.
mara's father?
there may be a way, but it may seem more frightening if you want me to explain it, so don't ask.
even on the map, i can't find maine, haven.
you're telling me you can't find a town with 00,000 population?
that's not the problem.
then why didn't we use aether in the first place to finish the trouble?
i can't bring them in sealed.
so how do we find it?
gloria brought a box full of stuff that duke left in gull.
i don't think william has what i need, and aether is just the first stage.
you told his wife you'd find him.
it's easy to choose from the edge, but sometimes things aren't what they seem.
i have a town to protect.
no wonder the plant is working at 00%.
guys, i'll try, but remember, i've never done anything like this before.
they parked the car here so i could talk to you, but i don't have enough money to pay for the oil change.
if all goes well, i'll be back with aether before the sun goes down.
this is peggy's husband, rolf.
there's enough panic and fear.
the same killer who killed my son 00 years ago?
we call him the murderer who didn't leave a trace.
what else are you hiding from me, vince?
dwight's doing everything he can to get the rules in order, but he's not the type to kill people.
in this haven, banishment is the same thing as executing.
thanks to our friend there, we're keeping them in some kind of prison.
he says the generator works at 00 percent.
damn, when the generator overloaded it must have cleared the energy reserves.
well, that explains the power to get the department into town.
at this speed, like, five minutes.
it's almost over, and this is the only thing that protects us from dying in the dark.
here, i reschedule the generators to get the power to the town faster, but there's nothing more we can do.
they better.
help each other.
turn the lights around.
share your supplies.
you see, i'm happy here.
i got your message.
get in the car now.
come on, jump!
we should be grateful if the war lies before us, even slean.
i don't think there's anything worse than being in love.
i don't like it here.
every story has two sides.
whoever's behind this is a traitor.
let's go.
she asked me to represent her at slean's wedding.
palace, you are my brother's love.
that's why you're my brother.
you've seen bigger places than this place in iraqi realms.
none were ruled by a woman.
you must choose a second man to escort you and watch your interests during the ritual.
then you will listen to the bonds of friends and relatives.
i have no relatives here.
my mother and the others will escort you.
kela, this is the palace from bregan.
rheda, must i always be protected?
i don't understand these things.
but i know i have to marry slean.
i'll love him.
this marriage cannot be accomplished.
abrecan trusts you.
what do you do?
carpenter.
then they can use you on the wall.
who are you?
a friend of the clave.
like i said, i have business to attend to.
we need to figure out how to handle it.
varr said i couldn't accept presents.
we'll keep it then.
every bride should smell good when the wedding time comes.
remember, this is our secret.
sit down.
we'll take what we'll get when we look at the wounded.
you wanted to talk?
all right.
kela, it's time for the moon.
elvina, will you be my second?
for the game.
we need to talk sometime.
we need to discuss reasons why marriage shouldn't work.
if we don't carry out our mission, their marriage can be canceled.
beowf!
let's celebrate.
in the old tradition!
the dress smells pimp.
i'm so sorry.
it was just a little mistake.
that's all.
we're gonna help slean give the symbol to his bride.
sounds easy.
breca!
open the door!
come on, you stinking mudborn.
come on!
come on!
give me your arm.
come on!
slean.
quiet, kela is sleeping.
are they ready for this marriage?
i don't understand why slean didn't want to marry kela.
i don't think so.
put aside your feelings and do what's best for everyone.
would you put aside what you want for others?
that's all we have to do.
if someone spends their whole life pleasing others, then that person isn't really alive.
it must make a man feel pretty free to think that way.
try it.
tell every rock the truth.
then you can look at each other and light the fire that symbolizes your marriage.
then you'll be husband and wife.
have you ever loved anyone before?
no.
before i come here...
do you want to be thane?
tell my uncle i'm done with him.
yeah.
come on!
go!
you let him go.
we're not done here.
don't you understand?
i betrayed my mother and dried my uncle.
this woman was sent here to kill you!
i don't know.
was it?
i killed my brother.
she was the one who should have been there today.
even if the world was destroyed, mara had everything.
people loved him because he was kind.
my father loved him as his first child.
rowan and lovers.
then i had the chance to escape.
i wouldn't need anything.
she died of a fever.
he was recovering.
i poisoned her.
slean, i'm not gonna tell anybody what you're doing here today and what's going on.
or stay.
i know, but she's beowull.
she went to bed last night.
but we can choose who to draw our fate with.
light the fire with me.
you want to be a thane?
i can help you.
against whoever sees you.
they can't take it away from you anymore, rheda.
with this marriage, you are the shieldlands jarl.
these rules of jarl should be carried by every tribe.
a killer's life will be terminated unless his blood money is paid.
_
the price of all the merchandise at shields will be identified by jarl.
what's the right to spot a fish price?
we're the ones that risked your life to catch every summer fair.
you should have told me about the rules.
you were where your people needed you the most, on guard.
i couldn't distract you.
it was messy enough.
you're late for the pandiri.
some people think you kidnapped her again.
but if you fail, bregan will be miserable and open the winter.
breca's wanted for murder, you know that.
kill him!
kill breca right now!
i got it!
you do that without any explanation, we all die.
after he escaped the gallows, he hired us to turn breca into his blood.
did we ask the guy who helped him escape the first time?
so we're gonna welcome this.
but we should keep breca.
heorot may be standing by our doors as we speak!
when did we kill young women?
what do you mean?
you've been hiding in the shadows for too long, abrecan.
don't forget who you're talking to.
talk.
the boy wants breca's life or blood money for his brother's murder.
i didn't mean to kill anyone.
hurry!
thanks.
breca made my mother fall in love with herself.
he calls the widows he thinks he's got money, then he steals the money, he runs away.
she left my mother and took everything precious with her.
my brother came after you.
but it cost you your life.
breca, is that true?
i'll pay for the boy's blood money.
lila, do you have 00 silver dollars?
i don't want money, i want blood!
silence!
if the blood money is paid, breca will be released.
you lied to me.
pandiri.
pandiri!
put him through now.
ready, they're coming.
i saw it.
get out!
council assembled.
she wants to take my place while i'm missing the pandiri.
you let me down, she married slean keela, rheda is jarl!
you don't understand.
tell the council our enemies have gathered, that your sister cannot rule, that she wants to save shields.
so tell me you're distracted.
tell me.
i'm sorry.
i knew breca killed someone, but the story she told me was different.
it's just his fault.
lila, nobody thinks bad things about you...
that's all i got.
did you bring it?
there's no 00 silver here.
it's not enough.
and i'm gonna hold breca while she sees it.
was there enough money?
lila?
please turn it off.
you're not talking to lila.
get on your horse, leave heorot and never come back.
there's no room for you here anymore.
if herot's going to be attacked, i want to fight properly.
if hero's attacked, i'll cover you.
let's try it.
this isn't about mudborn.
i don't want to talk about him.
i want to know why you lied about teaching me.
it's wasted on you.
you don't even want to be a spook.
really?
i didn't know we were training the blacksmiths!
go.
now!
fighting girls now?
the view was more like he was training the blacksmith huskarl.
i know you think i'm letting you down.
that i can't focus on my duties in bregan.
but i have my reasons.
you're talking betrayal to your own blood.
a warrior needs a warrior in this place!
someone who will remove your people from the darkness.
a man in power to take control!
you're talking about betraying your sister to hide the fact that you can't provide for your people.
what's the point of having fish if we're all to be slaughtered?
i am here to give our thane the vote of no confidence.
the ones against abrecan being a thane.
decided.
a new thane will be appointed and announced in the morning.
get up.
next.
nobody.
don't think this is a game!
we're lazy, distracted.
this is gonna work here.
from now on, we'll work like dad hrothgar.
i didn't mean to interrupt.
you're a good teacher.
a big thane wants a strong army behind him.
we don't have to share the same bed, but if we don't share the same room, people will talk.
i've always loved watching heorot from here.
it looks invincible.
i'll lose your confidence if i tell mom the truth.
and a chance to rule one day.
what if abrecan attacks?
heorot may fall.
no advice?
i trust you.
your decision will be correct.
and i'll be there when you do.
you'll be thane.
you just have to believe.
pandiri.
pandiri!
it's the pandiri!
sound the horn!
i order you, sound the horn!
abrecan, stop it.
if we don't act now, the opportunity will escape.
why... why... why... why...
you, help me carry the net.
help me with the net now.
why don't you help?
pandiri!
come on, hurry up!
go find me a sack.
people shouldn't leave their valuables anywhere.
you owe mom an apology.
but i'm a warrior and our honour is at stake.
so i'll take your life.
_
greetings.
i didn't need your help.
because he didn't have enough money to save you.
be thankful you didn't kill him, vishka.
if we don't get the nets in, our prey will escape.
no, he won't.
get ready.
abrecan, no!
hold the rope still!
hurry, they'll eat you raw!
pandiri, pandiri!
pandiri, pandiri!
hold tight!
now get back!
check it out.
there will be songs about this hunt.
it's a hunt you win.
i have a dream about us.
being the biggest tribe in shieldlands!
we're not going to follow the laws that even a jarl couldn't handle a sword.
who's with me?
abrecan, abrecan, abrecan!
i have to warn beowf.
bregan!
elvina!
their warriors come together.
their intentions are to destroy us.
beowf!
if we turn around today, we'll see more danger and more damage come from religious beliefs.
my wife, stand-up shows that if i talked about soviet communism or stalin's savages, it would be less embarrassing.
it's the state of the philosophy, especially of the kind of interrogation that allows people to make trouble.
presenting a situation perfectly correct in itself can cause serious damage.
when the prophecy doesn't come, we make fun of those people and the whole world will make fun of us.
because of this problem with richard dawkins, i had a friendly idea.
maybe richard and i should be more aggressive.
especially america is wrapped with christian faith.
they're sure what the world says.
we'll get rid of the bad guys.
i'd like to write a book like this if i could.
but one of my fears, of course, what will happen next.
what kind of chaos?
how true is it to the people who think that religion is protecting our civilization and the good in us somehow?
religion is a moral viagra to many people.
if that's true, if religion does lead to the moral lives of the people, then one will have to go out seriously, and the work will be put to the bottom line.
because there may be a lot of people on the bottom and we can make a chaos out of these people's fear.
a lot of people want their lives to mean something, and where does that come from?
but there must be something better than religion.
yeah, there's definitely hope.
let's see what happens.
of course.
at least you didn't get a piercing.
i don't know how to explain this to amy.
i'm the stupidest man in the world.
all right, now stop.
i'm the stupidest man in the world.
all right, you win this.
i can't find emma's papers.
honey, just so you know, even if you find the original receipt, you can't return the baby.
i need to find the paper that angela signed when she left emma at my door and gave me the one attorney.
i'm gonna get health insurance for what i'm in charge of me and myself.
i haven't talked to her since the night we did emma.
calm down.
you gave me all the important papers for the baby to be safe.
do you have all the papers?
her dad's little girl is a big girl.
maybe something balloonful.
that looks good!
you robbed a clown?
today is your birthday!
first birthday tomorrow.
you used to party all the time as a kid.
after celebrating my birthday...
"happy birthday, miley."
the papers i kept for you.
how irresponsible do you think i am?
but i...
maybe i didn't mail them in time, didn't post them, and i may not be the only one of emma's retainers.
we were all excited for the new baby came and i didn't have the stamp!
look, we just need to get angela to sign this paper again, and we'll be fine.
because you're ben's best friend and you're the only person who's ever seen her...
i like it, it's all right.
all right, emma's finally asleep.
hey, danny, what made riley not want to celebrate your birthday?
seriously, why does she hate it so much?
ben, riley didn't celebrate her birthday after her 00-year-old party.
are you sure you want to watch this?
i think i would remember if it was a disaster.
all right, come on, people.
danny, where are we going?
luckily, the future where you win a real moustache and lose a personality weight.
is ben here?
benjamin wheeler, come here and celebrate riley's birthday.
well, i can tell you that's the best birthday i've ever had.
tell the cake you didn't do anything.
actually, try to save it with the perm first, then cut it out.
is riley still in love with ben or is that something that happened when she was a kid?
unless you're still in love with riley.
i ruined her sweet 00 party.
she's not in her birthday line, but she certainly loves you the rest of the time.
if ben is so irresponsible that he lost the papers and so irresponsible to confront me, maybe he doesn't deserve to take emma's attorney alone.
if it makes you feel any better, we do most of the work.
i can imagine how hard it was to leave emma.
i knew you'd end up hurting her even if you thought she was funny or wonderful!
in your presence, in the city streets of your city, the elite u.s. army special tank unit, only three minutes self-destand trove trooper 00. 00. 00 minutes self-dest self-
and as madox-00. the weapon we remember as well as the madox-00.
besides, a uh-00 has more destroy power than blackhawk.
it's the perfect for anti-terrorist and anti-gerilla operations.
miss kusoto is the chief architect of software preparing for "tankbuster."
today, in order to expose madox's ability to reveal itself to the pilot's cabin.
unit 0 will go to ichigaya tonight.
we're in a hurry, so be quick as you can.
and...
miss kusumoto today, you have humiliated me.
i'm not here for the congratulations.
there's only one thing i'll tell you:
wow!
kouji...
what is it?
onose, you leave this to me!
they threw away their trash.
i'm telling you, don't worry.
i'll buy you dinner in exchange, right?
sdf's transport vehicle...
according to the reports, it was only natural to have encountered this...
obviously a terrorist thing.
you're far too alien to the east-block operations.
i hope you know what you're saying!
i hope you see the burden of this incident belongs to you all.
either way, the situation we're in is critical.
we were transporting him for a field test!
it's bad!
i have to be in the operation.
besides, madox-00.
the vehicles in the environment are causing trouble while investigating the crime scene.
shouldn't we just get support from the police?
we must prepare ourselves for the worst, and keep the help troops ready.
i'm the only one who can stand up and take care of madox.
although lieutenant kilgore is one of the most troopers in the army, he is.
is-is this okay?
nobody in the apartment?
anyway, i'm a little relieved.
shiori was really pretty...
when he goes to england, all the boys in japan will grieve.
where did you learn that?
he called me in the morning and asked me to give you a message.
_
it's burning!
he was able to adjust the cabin.
makes you feel like wearing ski boots.
we got a signal activating from madox.
it's a disaster.
could you heat up the microwave?
i really made a fool of myself!
shiori, what do you intend?
defense forces?
you're operating with a prototype air-condition tank.
don't you dare turn tokyo into vietnam!
tokyo ha vietnam is the same challenge for me.
you'll cause a disaster.
oh, don't worry.
i'll overcome the matter without getting too much work done.
lieutenant kilgore is using the most advanced tank and anti-tank choppers, my word is to get madox to take custody.
in this case, there'll be a huge panic downtown.
in these circumstances, there must be someone who can stop kilgore and madox.
what can we do?
we don't know the madox's target yet.
if i manage to find him before lieutenant kilgore, then maybe i'm in a can of luck.
but madox's condition...
i'm gonna use unit 0 through the power tests.
how much chance?
hey, you heard me!
wait for me.
that's it!
how's it going!
what are you doing on the way?
i can't wait by the side of the road like a stone!
you're a real driver, man!
i've got a lot more time to finish your installments!
he's back at the cabriolet!
bye, assholes!
yeah, saturdays, shinjuku was close to a car traffic.
i can't lose my mark in this crowd!
this "madox" must really be valuable.
spider 0 to jackal 0.
target moving!
he's acting on his own...
one of the apaches was shot down.
all units are authorized to destroy the madox.
just like kilgore wanted.
he's heading towards the skyscrapers with the apache after him.
evacuate the civilians at once!
they're coming all over me!
i gotta go over there, take the west exit.
another lunatic's out of armor!
all right, back to work, madox!
i hear you.
and i say, "you're a pain in the ass."
if anyone is causing chaos, it's you.
"just" what?
none of your business.
i can't do anything i don't know what it means!
no!
yes, captain!
"nsr parking spot -
exit exit exit."" exit.""
i did it!
shiori is up there!
i won't let you take another step.
i can't!
i can't waste any more time with you!
i thought you were an amateur, so i shouldn't be nice to you.
time to jump around and stop jumping.
it won't work!
he's just a boy!
what were you trying to do with all this?
my name is sugimoto kouji, second-class student of the kantto institute of technology.
all i wanted to do was meet my girlfriend who's waiting for me at the nsr building.
first he locked me in, then he dropped his own helicopter.
i understand.
miss kusumoto, this is spider 0, this is kilgore.
really, i watched your show.
you fight pretty hard.
in the yokota headquarters, personally, i'll take care of whatever it takes.
hey, where are the civilians in the building?
what's so important?
why am i freaking out when i think of you?
he's got madox on his target.
he'll come after you to destroy him.
most of all, i know how to walk and use my hands.
it's up to you to make it.
either the madox will be destroyed, or you will kill kilgore!
they damaged my legs.
i can't move anymore.
you think i can take him?
you were fine when we were fighting.
did you read the entire manual?
hi, madox.
adi it!
come kill me!
wouldn't you stand up a little more and raise my pleasure?
l-lanet!
what, you turned around like a turtle!
if you can't do this much, you're gonna ruin the name of tankbuster!
your numbers don't get to me!
kouji!
coming!
you were brave!
i'm sick of your cat-fare play!
you fell into my medicine trap!
if i fall, i'll take you with me, madox!
this is messed up with madox!
there are some very important things i want to tell you, shiori.
paul wouldn't hurt anyone.
"it can't be fixed."
i'm not your mother, brian.
you don't even like me.
will you really stay?
nothing has been clear.
i haven't even written my watch yet.
_
can they sew her up again?
what's your mother's name?
am i reacting to the internal affairs?
yeah, but searching his room is a violation of his privacy.
john, what would you say if i told you i asked the waitress at doc magoo's if she hadn't come to weaver the night we lost the marfan patient in marfan syndrome?
i say it's full of people with a pager.
where did he get these?
will you buy the tickets?
someone may come and claim the body.
abby, can you look at something?
what patient?
how are you?
or find someone else to eat lunch lunch with someone else you can eat with.
try to find his father.
please call my social worker and pick me up somewhere else?
would you please get me out of this room?
he stabbed carter.
why outside?
not yet.
i don't want him taken away anywhere else he doesn't know about.
where they keep the children, it's more comfortable than the er or the morgue.
who removed libertique from the sewing room?
you gotta clear the vein road?
sats are 00 sats. 00 sats
parole was released.
i am in love with bruce lee.
they're discharging paul.
what are you doing?
i was stabbed in the back.
where the hell were you?
and you said you were okay.
it's nice to find a special mail in the bills and junk mail.
w- and i did everything i could... all the parents should be accused of this!
mothers and fathers, adults...'....'..'..'..'
so it's certainly an advantage that you have a solid family history.
i'm not saying that whatever happens...
do you sit comfortably?
but before we start...
what's going on, brother?
you like it, don't you?
fat cunt.
fucking bastard.
who is this?
you all right, fellas?
anything?
i'm tony's friend.
fuck...

i was picking up something from marcel and i saw kirby in the street.

this is chris, okay?
he's bigger than you.
he just wants to talk, okay?

she was my sister!
you're sending a boy to do a man's work, and he's fucking up!

i'm sorry about your brother.

brother jake...

marcel, you set me up?
marcel, talk to me, brother!
you set me up, brother?
you used me, brother!
i didn't tell you to kill that girl!
that's it.
my sister was only 00 and you killed her!
look at me!
look at me.
okay.
i just got out, but i lost my key.
the christian mothers were lazy, perhaps.
...they were leaving scented.
no bruises...
isn't that kind of hard, though?
what are you talking about, brother?
my guy's here.
yes, karaoke?
i was gonna be there, wasn't i?
yeah, i'll be there.
listen, i gotta go, all right, babe?
fuck!
what are you up to?

one of them was in my place the other day, always going to the bathroom... and he said he didn't do drugs!
what are you saying?
aaron and the other idiot, ed.
i don't know what they're doing.
not in my place, man!
okay, brother.
get out of my way.
what did you say about mom, brother?
what did you tell mom, brother?

ed!
what the fuck?
brother, a woman left on the train.
and you brought her here to me?
look, brother, it's more complicated than you think, okay?
where did you get that?
i found it somewhere.
00 cops with foam came out of nowhere.
this was the smartest thing you ever did!
what are you gonna do with this baby?
you gonna give it to the cops?
and tell you i changed my mind and come back?
i look like a pedophile.
no, if i do, they'll send me home or something, right?
a woman leaves her own child on the train!
you see, she doesn't want him.
now i'm gonna change your underwear!
i'll keep an eye on the gun for you, okay?
will you help me find her mother?
i have more important things to do than deal with this kind of bullshit.
you give me the gun, i'll hide it somewhere, okay?
give me the stuff.
why did you put it there, man?
take it!
no, call me when you're done with this nonsense, okay?
because we have things to do, okay, faggot?
daddy!
let go!
move!
can ashley come?
sir?
i got it, man.
well, i'm a little nervous, hon.
what are you nervous about?
we're gonna figure this out.
well, i was talking to vince...
this is a child that her mother doesn't want.
what are you doing, brother?
what's your problem, man?
why are you acting like a whore?
who are you, my brother, jeremy kyle?
you can't sell someone's baby to someone else!
especially vince and carol.
the other day, we were selling junk bitches to this guy!
no, you didn't, because she doesn't want to be found, man.
they're gonna give this kid to another vince and carol.
let go of me, brother.
told you i'd take care of it, man.
what am i gonna tell people?
yeah, yeah, good.
yes, but don't tell anyone we're here!
just half of it, give me the rest.
i can't believe you sold a baby!
you didn't want it before, did you?
if i'm gonna go through all this stress, i'm gonna lose the money, i'm gonna lose everything, so you're gonna have to talk to someone properly, okay?
a nice lady.
i'm in "fuck you," or something.
what's going on in there?
you sell drugs in a bar, right?
either you or your stupid brother got my gun and i need that gun.
you've got two hours to get my gun back, or i'm gonna break people's houses.
i'm leaving.
she always spoils things, doesn't she?
why are you bringing this whore to my place when my wife's upstairs?
what's going on?
she was having trouble with a solid russian mafia everywhere.
she thought they were gonna kill the baby.
so she left the baby on the train.
now, take this money, i'll give you the rest when i meet ed.
it's not a fool, vince, and you know it!
you can't figure it out without a dick in your mouth, can you?
it's okay when i have your fuck in my mouth!
she said your cock was in her mouth.
i'm not giving them the baby!
they can't take it either!
calm down, okay?
now get up and get that baby!
here!
dude!
just know you're dead to give it to you.
they may not leave you because you have no family.
do you have any suggestions?
white roses are good, right?
fuck off then!
fuck you!
are you the owner of this vehicle?
but you stopped me for nothing.
but first, let's raise our glasses to the new owner, chester.
chester.
i hope she will tremble on these magnificent monsters like i have done for years.
cheers.
i promise i will rise up the standards of this show and you will be proud of it.
have a nice trip where dreams come true.
oh, thank god.
even if that sour german is gone, may the dominance pass us.
marjorie, it's very shame...
thanks, chester.
now, if you'll excuse me... let the original family, monsters and strange community... spend your last moments alone.
bye.
there's someone else to thank.
mr. richard spencer.
our lives have changed its course completely.
cheers.
mm!
but first tonight we're gonna have a nice feast, and then we're gonna watch a movie from my own collection.
not the sign of the cross again.
no.
tonight we watch freaks.
you know this movie, richard?
i don't know.
it's a great movie.
tell me about it, eve, paul.
ah.
cleopatra is a natural-born trapeze artist, marrying a midget who makes small shows.
but the point is to poison him and put him in his inheritance.
he plays all the freaks in his finger until one day he gets too drunk and takes away his true intentions.
then all freaks turn against him.
they get revenge on knives and guns one night.
home, home.
darling... don't fool around with your end.
that sounds great!
there's a lot to do before we head west.
i can't.
shut up and sit down.
you deserve it.
what happened to you?
come on, richard, pick up.
i've been thinking about you a long time.
oh, thank god.
when we saw our exhibit, we had clients who were stunned... but no one had ever fainted.
are you all right, ma'am?
where are those security guards?
good to know.
now it's your turn.
jesus christ.
i don't even know this.
i already told them everything...
stanley.
elsa... elsa... elsa el
come on...
talk to them.
hollywood!
i'm afraid... that's all.
just a dream.
come on, turn it around.
aah!
god... god...
no.
please.
my cousin works at the garden of allah.
but you brought death here... and you have to pay for it.
take him down.
come on, come on.
elsa, come on... we need to talk in private.
i believe we find something in common.
you think you can run now?
i'm right.
he killed her.
she's not who you think she is.
and start running.
run!
run!
run!
just because your dad grew up doesn't mean you have to romanticize the job because he's dead.
how did he die?
who killed him?
we all did.
he broke the rule.
now.
come on.
that was my father!
he killed a freak!
and the most delicate in us.
you believe his word?
this fraud whore?
i saw dear ma petite with my own eyes in a jar.
i've heard it with my own ears.
as for maggie, if she didn't help, we'd have more bodies.
i won't forgive him.
all i want is rot in hell.
in this case, you'll be friends with whoever finds it.
maggie's gonna change her bandages.
no!
keep the dirty.
now that your mom's not here, it's up to me to protect you and protect you.
i've seen you turn into a man from childhood to a leader-- and we need you.
i don't have hands!
i can't even piss myself.
i got an old friend.
he'll come and help you.
he's a real artist.
but the wounds have to heal first.
maggie will help you.
let him.
i'm so sorry.
i hate hurting you.
really?
i thought that was your only skill- to hurt people.
i love you, jimmy.
this part is real.
i always have.
i want to start over.
we can still go to new york like we planned.
why not?
you're kidding, right?
you think after all you've done, we're just gonna sail to the new horizonts?
my hands... in a fucking jar, and it's all your fault.
i'm so sorry.
can you turn ma petite from the dead?
huh?
i've changed, jimmy.
ah!
i knew you were dumb, let's add blind to your list, shall we?
get me someone to focus the lamp!
i can't leave this place.
i have to adjust the proper light for the first time, understand?
try again now!
scheisse!
elsa.
sure.
he's watching us.
can't we?
just this once?
please?
okay.
yeah.
mm.
oh.
thanks, chester.
you threw me down.
like an old sock.
i'm sorry, marjorie.
i got a little... carried away, but i'm happy now.
they've got my magic show, you're in.
maybe i should go.
we can handle it, marjorie.
the twins accepted you.
they just don't want you watching them do things.
they're using you, chester.
you're their boss now.
no, they don't.
they love me.
you're a murderer.
no, no.
no.
marjorie.
i know you don't like to talk about it, so don't bring it up, but... you killed them.
and alice and lucy.
impossible.
i'm just a puppet.
hmm.
love destroys you, chester.
you're losing control.
i know...
i'm a monster.
you don't need them.
i'm in.
i know.
please don't leave me, marjorie.
twins?
they have to go.
i know.
they will.
ethel looks great here with the choir girls.
oh, this is from his barnum days.
she was a unique woman.
ethel.
ethel.
so what do you say?
nobody heard what spencer said last night?
now everything is in place.
elsa killed ethel.
forest.
car accident.
it was all a setup.
i believe that.
that crazy, gruddy woman threw a knife at my paul.
elsa's only problem.
i never got it in my head anyway.
i know ethel.
he wasn't someone to kill himself.
he's not a coward.
she wouldn't have done it to her own child, and she wouldn't have done it to us.
and leave a decent note.
we know exactly what we're gonna do if someone comes after one of us.
our future has one security.
that's elsa not living.
have you ever dreamt you might feel that way, dot?
thank god you told us about marjorie.
all he had to do was push him.
i think we certainly made a good impression on him.
good evening, girls.
what are you doing here?
i'm here to extend a friendly xindia.
i've been getting some information on your last mission.
we don't want to hear anything from you.
kindly leave.
oh, dot, i can't blame you.
i had a terrible behavior the other day.
but the recent events have made my tough side soft.
i lost my mother.
it was sudden and... horrible.
she was very upset, dandy.
it's horrible for anyone to lose a mother.
it was.
it is.
and it made me feel like i shouldn't leave my loved ones behind.
but i think you should know we're seeing a man.
actually, i got your news.
you have no idea how grateful it would be to marry you.
if i had the chance to overcome everything...
i came with friendly feelings.
i know i'm losing my chances.
i'm not half the man you deserve.
but i asked myself.
"dandy, what do you have to do to support the loved girls?"
and then it occurred to me that i might be able to protect you, and i hired a decent man to gather information about your new friend.
it broke my heart because your chester creb crab was a freak!
we don't need to look at these.
what's your problem?
you're a pain in the ass, and we don't trust you as much as we do.
ta-ta, then.
i did my best.
my mother always said that when a woman was angry, you don't argue with her.
who is it?
son.
here.
drink.
what's that?
penicillin.
i'd hate to see you die of an infection by complete you.
who are you?
my name is massimo dolcefino.
i'm here to do your new hands.
okay?
massimo is an old friend of mine from before the war.
he's a master of art.
no, thanks.
i saw soldiers with a grenade exploded in their hands.
they put these cool hooks on their hands.
i can't take 00, but at least i can keep my cigarettes on my own.
and i don't have to be afraid of wood dryers for the rest of my life.
massimo offers you something more elegant than bacon hooks.
more convincing.
look.
see?
so is the other one.
massimo saved my life.
your mother would die of drinking, and she'd starve you to the streets.
i could have married her if you weren't so stupid.
"all sins..."..."... my one sin..."
si.
"... loving you..."
very, very very very, very very very
no!
they were members of a organization.
and the leaders are a doctor you know.
go to the next one, don't rush this time.
for two years,
massimo took care of me.
she taught me to walk.
and dance.
then hungburg fell.
nurmberg, rhineland...
we still had the chance to escape.
we had a plan.
how could i look into my love's eyes when i knew those beasts were free?
they were supposed to pay.
i caught them all one by one.
aah!
finally, i got the leader.
ah, the head of the monsters.
dr. hans grouper.
there shouldn't be a painless death.
obviously my death wouldn't be painless either.
he took me personally to kill him.
very personal.
he tortured me.
she locked me in a cell and tortured me again, and again.
how did you get out?
i lived in austria until the end of the war.
then i came to america- 00.
and i've been looking for miss mars for years.
but i couldn't answer.
if you loved her so much, and you knew where she was, why didn't you come to your feet?
my body was out of torture but...
i was like a pinocchio.
i had nothing left inside me for humanity.
but, uh...
beautiful irony.
beautiful irony.
i know you've been together for a long time and it might be hard to make changes for a sit-down show.
and i repeat- it has nothing to do with ego.
for this continuity...
it looks so normal.
i don't think we can judge him after we have absolutely no proof.
and the file?
it says he killed his wife.
you let dandy's lies embarrass your judgment.
dot and i have something to tell you.
we don't want to be your assistant anymore.
why?
we just... don't want to.
maybe you'll change your mind when you hear my final.
two bodies, two heads.
it's gonna bring a lot of noise.
a first in the history of magic.
come on girls... let's rehearse.
we're not going in that box.
no, chester... we're not going in that box.
now excuse me...
i'll go.
you...
i could be your assistant.
it is.
in the box, lucy.
my name is maggie.
oop!
is this your magic show?
it looks kind of pathetic.
shut up.
i didn't say anything.
what are you looking at?
backstage.
it's called the original magic saw.
tonight's play belongs to me... to a very dangerous version of this game.
handcuffs.
hey, i...
i don't know this part.
i went to war for you.
you should have died there.
we loved each other.
and then you came back with a metal plate in your head and a sparkling bees in your head.
chester, stop, i can't move my feet!
stop!
stop talking!
you distract me.
wait, marjorie.
haven't you ruined my life enough?
you're nothing without me.
i'll show you.
all of you.
chester!
chester!
chester, stop!
what are you doing?
relax, folks... it's just a magic show.
magic show.
i can get her back in search.
again...
alakazam!
abraka...
abracadabra.
this is gonna be a lot of people, chester.
she made me do it.
she deserved it.
what do we do now?
_
why are you packing?
you've ruined everything again.
time to go.
you confused me.
you did this consciously to sabotage me.
i finally found happiness.
i'm leaving.
you can't leave without me.
oh.
i loved you.
chester... chester chester chester...
oh, god...
marjorie?
stay with me.
marjorie.
_
jimmy darling!
i'm not a stage artist like you, mom.
listen to your mother.
you've got a really good smile and a great weather.
you're a star quality, jimmy.
now get your ass up on the stage and show your mother why she's proud of you.
jimmy.
maggie's dead.
want the details?
elsa's next.
tonight.
looks like... you're gonna have a chance in real life now.
jimmy... jimmy... jimmy jimmy jimmy... jimmy
good for you.
how dare you come in unannounced!
what do you want?
you have to go.
they've been planning revenge all day in ethel's trailer.
they'll kill you.
why should i believe you, huh?
my monsters love me.
i'm like their mother.
ethel was more like his mother than you.
you killed their real mother.
the last nonsense of a desperate man.
now who's desperate?
you saw what they did to her.
but where would i go?
anywhere but here.
you could have saved me.
now we have.
there you are.
what's jimmy doing?
he'd be here if he could.
it's time.
give me that.
ethel!
let's get some... justice.
oh.
thanks for coming.
i would never refuse a woman in a difficult situation.
_
but i'm in a hurry.
oh.
i want to report a murder.
who was murdered?
a young woman.
leave it here.
slowly.
put your hands where we can see them.
i did it.
send me away.
what are you doing here?
i came to count.
i'm the new owner.
where's elsa?
gone.
he followed his dreams.
elsa sold us again.
$00,000 in cash.
nothing.
everything here, including your contracts, belongs to me now.
and i want to see what belongs to me.
was that always your dream, sir?
being in show business?
dream.
yeah.
and now it's becoming real.
thirsty.
go get me a lemonade with a straw.
yes, sir.
are you ready?
yeah.
they're perfect.
i want to try it now.
sure.
the other one.
you take it.
thank you.
but jesse james got away and hid for two years.
in the great event, the united states army has defeated the armies of sitting bull and crazy horse and the gold in the black hills of south dakota.
after the defeat at the battle of little bighorn, the united states government has chosen the way to starve the lakota people into starvation and submission.
hold the line!
but despite the small battles they've won against the u.s. army, the fight for indians was getting worse.
lakota leaders sitting bull and crazy horse's options were running low.
you're a man with a strong heart.
but i'm tired.
i'll see you.
the americans didn't give up, despite the violence they saw and the destruction of their native tribes and their culture.
to go there for the living sometimes meant getting a chance to get rich.
many women and men have tried their luck.
the united states was the first country to save itself from global buhran when the golden economy resolved.
the solution was found in the west.
there's been a lot of cattle in texas for a long time.
but it wasn't possible that they would be moved to the east to starry people until the railroads finished.
in texas, the cattle that were given 00 bucks a head for 00 bucks a head, were sold for 00 bucks in the east coast.
the cattle barons bought a large part of the california smuggling grounds from kansas.
these lands gave their owners incredible opportunities.
we're talking about millions of hectares of land, farms and thousands and thousands of great animals.
one of the cattle thieves in the new mexico area would turn into one of their famous-stricken men.
his story started 0,000 miles east.
billy never knew his father.
he moved to new mexico with his mother in the early 0000s.
for years he wandered aimlessly.
what do you want?
whiskey.
leave the bottle.
there were different kinds of cowboy.
always sitting in a corner.
that's all you had to watch out for.
billy used what he did best to make a living.
billy the kid was such a good weapon.
he spent every dollar he had on a productive basis for bullets.
in a place like this, only strong survive.
where are you going?
lincoln.
i'm just passing through here.
these cattle belong to john tunstall.
then john tunstall can come and get their cattle.
it's in your best interest if you let me go.
i don't think so.
i don't think you have a choice.
young cattle thief billy the kid has been caught by a farmer who tried to steal his cattle cattle.
most people shoot cattle thieves where they see them.
you still haven't told me who you're working for.
i don't work for anyone.
everyone works for somebody in lincoln county, son.
yeah, but i don't work.
you seem like a man used to getting what you wanted.
you're right.
there's only one problem, and so am i.
you got a lot of men.
do you have room for one more?
when billy the kid came to lincoln, he needed a job.
john tunstall needed cowboys.
_
she moved to lincoln county where she could make money.
but this success has made some powerful men angry.
lincoln was one of the wildest places in the wild west.
everything was in ev's control until the cattle prices, soil and government officials.
they even paid their lawman's salary.
in fact, most of the living in lincoln have seen them as bully.
john henry tunstall has meddled with the cattle business that's been in ev's monopoly for a long time.
no one could stay impartial.
when billy got in with john henry tunstall, he became tunstall's man.
in a few months, young outlaw became tunstall's most trusted gunman.
for the first time in her life, she felt like an orphan in the west.
tunstall was a mentor to billy the kid.
pass me your plate, billy.
thanks.
i'm starving.
everything is going well, kid.
i'm glad you're here.
thanks.
billy was always hard.
he was seen as a team of men.
it was incredible and life-changing for a young man of billy's age.
while billy the kid was a part of the cattle industry that's fueling america's growth, several hundred miles north was doing everything he could to stop the expansion.
calm down, guys.
i'm sending my left hand as a friendship proposal.
many of us wouldn't be here today if he hadn't done that.
we would have died fighting to the reservation.
when they put us in the settlement, they actually took the human spirit.
she trusts me.
she's talking to me.
god, messiah.
this policy is known as "asimation".
but i think they wanted to make us unprotected.
there was a promise used in the army.
"kill the indian and protect the man."
if you destroy the indians' culture, you'd be a better man.
they thought we were savages.
the proud lakota warrior knew he had to stand up for his people again.
i'm not happy here."
"i'm not happy here."
"we don't want to live in a place where we live."
you're not used to life in the settlement.
give it time.
i'm sure you'll like it.
after presenting his objections to the u.s. authorities the military fears the lakota warrior could start a new indian legation.
the united states was terrified of the crazy horse.
word was crazy horse wanted to kill a general who visited him.
the u.s. authorities were worried about a new rumor.
as the frightened horse planned something, the lakota warrior went to meet with the authorities to clear his name.
crazy horse thought he was seeing the u.s. authorities.
he never realized the importance of the situation before.
they wanted to put him in the prison cell.
then he pulled out his knife.
in spite of different visions, i think the most reliable interpretation is that the white u.s. sentry kills him with a bayonet.
crazy horse couldn't get killed in the battlefield.
his vision was right.
unexpectedly defeated by the guard.
on september 0, 0000, mad horse, a man who fought to protect his people for the rest of his life and won a war against the united states, was killed.
it's hard to talk about the crazy horse's death because even after all these years, the pain is fresh.
one of the most fascinating side of the crazy horse and his inheritance... is that among the american leaders in the history of the united states, he's one of the few people who aren't best friends.
today, it is considered a symbol of courageous resistance to the united states government, and speak with respect.
i think that's the reason behind being so strong.
with the death of the crazy horse, the lakota people waited for a leader to save the rest of their desperate culture.
until we paid ev catron's debt, their prosperity was their business.
this is for you.
what if she resists?
i don't care how.
i'm only interested in the result.
copy that.
go check it out.
you stay here.
okay.
what's your hurry, guys?
we heard a shot.
really?
don't do anything stupid, son.
this has nothing to do with you.
it'll help you stay like this.
there are always conflicting interests in this competition.
but like most ideas in the west, it became personal.
when someone was killed, it got personal.
it was john henry tunstall.
she was killed because of the employment.
it was a personal matter now.
with john tunstall's death, billy is on his way to find his killers.
this road would take him to become a legend of the west of a cowboy who doesn't know him.
as the country continues to expand, men like billy the kid... have realized that the border is not ruled by law.
but over 000 miles ahead of new mexico, a man was preparing to bring laws to the west.
no one was tooth-eat wyatt earp's dentures from wyatt earp, where men get what they want and every day is a struggle for survival.
he was big by the 00th century standards.
he was so excited about his size.
wyatt earp was one of thousands of americans who raided the west to become rich.
wyatt was caught in an immature western disease.
he always felt he had to push the next border.
the border mining would be investigated, real estate, anything to bring adventure.
wyatt's life was like this.
he did every job on the border to get it.
ray has done everything for the pacific railroad to hunt buffalo on dozens of rackalos and even the whorehouse in brothel.
they had to drive the cattle to the east, where they had to drive the cattle to the railroad centers which quickly became crowded cities.
so the fast-faced cities appeared.
a view of the unscheduled land suddenly turned into a hotel with 00 rooms.
young men who made it to these cities, they were smoking crazy whiskey and carrying guns.
i mean, there were lots of young men with good drinks and guns.
it was one of the reasons the west was wild.
wyatt saw that there was no law in dodge city, and the conflict was solved by violence.
she had a hard life.
either they'd go back east or they'd be worse.
but wyatt earp felt there was more to her fate.
he was going to prove in dodge city that there would be an important place in history.
you got the wrong guy.
that's my money.
this guy's a cheat.
calm down.
he cheated.
calm down.
he cheated.
put the gun down.
did you see the gun?
everyone saw him reach for his gun.
give me that.
i'll shoot you!
come on.
the dodge city needed a desperate lawman.
wyatt earp was perfect for this.
it didn't take long for wyatt earp to be a police chief of dodge city.
there was no special training to be a lawman.
that's not how it works in this town.
wyatt earp wouldn't ask questions.
it's a term from "shaving with carca."
wyatt earp became famous in dodge city shortly.
his role as a lawman would be the most famous figure in the west.
because cartoon chickens give dad nightmares.
where were you?
and that was irving berlin's white christmas.
it's the most selling christmas song of all time, all the time's
what?
actually, irving berlin wrote over 0,000 songs.
then marry her.
what's your problem?
i have no problem.
you've got somebody who's gonna write music.
what's that supposed to mean?
what are you guys doing this holiday season?
hey, baby.
where are you going?
father melley called.
i have to protect jesus' birth scene in church.
i have to cook something for the food sales.
did you hear me complain?
what's rhyming with poinsettia?
forgot again!
you're a hard man!
i can't produce anything in a hostile environment!
i wouldn't be hostile if you had the ability to make two cents!
you kick me again, i'll go.
your legs are crooked.
how's it going?
so i brought you some soup and some thick jacket.
yeah, i'll call her.
horribly ordinary!
sucks!
of course not!
yeah, and you know i'm a jew in eight.
good.
i'm gonna go get a bagel or something.
_
_
but whatever i decide, it will be fine!
i only have three days to make cake!"
she doesn't sound that way, but whatever.
boom!
i was gonna make a cake, but i had to work late.
and i'm done.
i mean thanks, hungarian bakery!
says who?
larry's wife won't bring it.
she's making an amazing cake!
you know what she's doing?
any chance of you in that town?
i really thought you were gonna make the cake!
i'm not blackmail?
you know why she would never be with you?
because she'll have to take her own arm.
stop it!
wonder!
i'm being naive.
what are you doing?
sounds like you're starting.
kitchen robot, big eyebrows...
let me think.
nice, easy cake recipe.
how about that chocolate cereal?
at least i'm putting you in my pants proper shirts...
a monkey can do it.
i love you.
i love you.
i imagine we're giants?
no.
you should've put in more baking soda.
you don't even know what a lock is!
and nobody wants to buy this stupid toy cake!
we'll take the cake sale in a closed plate.
okay.
i've never had my calves this much.
come here!
isn't he?
after all that prepared...
anyway, try this.
divine taste.
it's okay.
we're not making a traditional food sale.
we're doing something more fun.
all right.
great plan!
i didn't count on your cake walk!
i've never seen caramel do that.
it's a candy-covered chair-covered cinder!
come on.
hi, ling.
i have your spiritual problem.
well, when did i...
elaine?
whatever.
i see him, but he's a heavy shot.
how long has this been going on?
what does that mean?
i think you're in love.
how do i get out of this?
i got myself together.
i'm ready to sing now.
i'm looking for my soul tonight.
i know there's plenty more to life.
thanks for seeing me.
can i help you?
my wife cindy died two years ago.
we were married for three years.
our anniversary was hit by a car.
cindy and i wanted to have children.
for example, that he's dead.
how are you gonna do that?
did she leave the egg embryo?
no.
did you hear me?
i heard.
to clone your dead wife?
scientists are trying this by the hand, mr. cage.
so i secretly attempted to try for cindy.
my sister-in-law has hired a lawyer to stop it.
that's why i need a lawyer.
he's going to court today.
yes, but mr. stoller, i must say i'm sure your wife was a wonderful person.
but the idea of cloning?
please.
there's nowhere else i can apply.
and your firm has met this lawyer before.
who was it?
larry paul.
i hear you're very successful.
it was him.
how can you have a virtual relationship?
a relationship means communication.
what about him?
i know you don't, but a woman can't control a man if her hands aren't on the stupid stick.
all you care about is control.
i don't know.
really?
and you came here to talk about my virtual relationship?
i came to borrow something.
but forget it.
ally?
excuse me?
it's the opposite attorney, larry.
really?
here's a conflict of interest for me, isn't it?
you're responsible for the client.
yes... but...
you didn't use little inside information while you were defending him?
no, but i...
why wouldn't i?
just for the client.
my case is underestimated.
i need something.
larry's weak point, beatim.
he speaks to me very quickly as i argue because he knows i can't understand what's coming to me.
okay.
she's vulnerable when she loses her rhythm.
okay.
you're in your dreams with cindy margollis.
michelle garris emailed me and asked me a way to get into hollywood.
we met in hollywood and...
do it!
i won't let myself drive.
we can't deny our passion any more.
you want me and i want you.
let's be honest.
you do my knee and i'll get my hair done.
you're breaking my spinal cord.
don't you like denial?
so let's be honest.
i'm going!
i went to l.a., and i didn't even think of you.
your mind is in jackson.
people blame me on the surface.
but when it comes to relationships, i understand human behavior.
in the last month, you were shaving your legs in the morning.
that's your sciencesis?
if a woman shaves in the morning, it's over.
unstable.
go to jackson.
he's the man you're crazy about.
well, first of all, cloning humans is against society--
the court has not been brought before.
when people are against cloning sheep...
that's not the case.
you don't let me get to second...
" second" is a sexual term.
i completely object.
i wish i could get back to the sheep.
these rats have no place in court.
let's move on to the verdict.
soon?
let's hear what mr. paul has to say.
secondly, forgive my bad...
he's kidding.
even if it can clone, mr. stoller can't make the decision.
too many.
i'm predictable in law cases, but i was caught unprepared for too much.
he made fun of me three times.
i demand a written apology, preferably notary.
four!
is this cloning possible?
first, i want to hear your client and i want to know why.
your honor, i was hoping...
see you tomorrow.
see you.
ling denies even wanting him.
what do you feel?
she can have it.
this guy's depth is like a squid bottle.
i mean, i hope ling drowns.
are you really okay?
yeah.
actually, john cage was the other side's attorney.
did you know?
how'd it go?
smiling is against your principles.
what's going on?
don't ask me.
john wanted some clues he could use against you in court, so i told him to break your rhythm.
you're useless without a beat.
cute, but useless.
you gave him advice?
his client is my client.
we're sleeping with you.
you're behind my back.
you're giving him advice when you can't defeat me?
does john know you can never beat me?
excuse me?
does john know you never beat me?
no, no.
never?
isn't that nice laugh?
so cute.
i'm gonna beat you one day, but john's gonna beat you today with my advice.
great.
i'll lose my superiority.
no, you won't.
now she knows i'm trying to break the rhythm.
he said you could never beat him.
not only in this case, in any case.
she did?
yeah.
i bet, john.
she said i could never defeat her?
exactly.
never?
never.
sure.
i can date a man in paris.
you can get as far away from here as you want.
i'm not gonna get you into this.
no, i don't.
how was i?
larry?
why are you here?
i thought john and i could walk together.
you try to confuse me, i won't let that happen.
i saw your smirk.
it wasn't supportive.
everything all right, john?
you seem a little restless.
he's trying to keep his superiority, but it won't work on me.
good.
want to go out for dinner?
i'd love to.
i'm full today, but how about tomorrow?
great.
we always talked about having kids.
i think i want to fulfill cindy's dream and mine.
but you're not talking about having cindy's child.
you want to clone him.
the only way to maintain his genetic inheritance is cloning.
many, many people, including mr. paul, who sincerely lived there...
your honor, i'd like to stand up unofficially.
mr. paul, sit down.
mr. cage, don't provoke.
a lot of people think cloning is disgusting.
but i'm not a scientist trying to perfect the living species.
and i know i can't bring cindy back.
i want to keep the generation going.
and i guess i don't want him extinct.
thanks.
first, i'm sorry for your loss.
but you're trying to copy cindy, right?
this is the process of creating a complete genetic copy of your dead wife.
well, it sounds the same...
cindy ever mention genetically manipulated fruit?
he was against it.
and the chickens played by genetics?
he was against it.
but it was clear to the idea that the genetics were made by their own copies.
it's not the same!
not everything is about chicken, counselor.
i didn't say that.
i'm nervous enough without you.
you wouldn't let anyone get your number.
whatever makes you wonderful, you have to win it again.
maybe melanie scared him away.
john, i'm sorry, man.
but remember, larry said you could never beat him.
never.
you should think big now.
because this time, i won't rub his feet.
no matter what, you have to find barry white.
yeah.
yeah.
come on!
we did it together, baby.
does ally know?
the pressure doesn't help me.
may i?
sure.
just you and me.
bullshit!
how does this cloning work?
very impressive.
we're getting eggs from the transmitters we injecting the reproductive drugs.
from the cloning candidate, this is cindy stoller, we're taking cells.
this part is very impressive.
the witness said it was fascinating.
is this just impressive?
then we lure every egg core with a needle.
there's too much needle in the cloning.
we're putting the dna-free eggs next to the transmitter cell.
in that case, cindy's cell.
and we're energizing.
what does that mean?
we're dealing with heat, sort of an electrical...
i'm trying to understand.
you're trying to kill the bug, and i find it disgusting, even for a public supervisor.
let's move on.
you both fall out of my sight.
what happens to the cells after the energy is given?
they mingle each other when they're given energy to dna-free cells.
then we put these in the surrogate mother, and eventually there's a cloned baby.
sperm?
no, that's very impressive.
is that really possible?
i gotta admit, most embryos are dying.
but it's possible that one of them is successful.
we've already tried that in sheep.
it's possible for humans.
how far away is this technology?
it's available for now.
people don't expect science.
scientists are waiting.
thanks, doctor.
hey, mark.
if you need anything, call my assistant.
i don't see you in heavy gravity anymore, two-faced jackal.
i see it.
maybe another time.
what's going on?
i'll tell you at dinner sometime.
forget it.
what's your problem?
what's wrong with me?
i threw myself in front of you.
i threw it like a cannonball.
you know what this is big for me?
i made you a gesture.
last week i told you i was in love.
anyone can share such a stupid feeling.
please.
i want something very small.
closing conversations are coming up, you should be with me.
together, we can beat larry.
just you and me.
come on!
your career is over.
what else do you have to do?
are you here?
you're here!
that's why i'm starting today on a ladle.
he was here.
who?
barry white came.
forgive me if i can't guess.
my concentration.
not like before.
when there are others in the room, i can't bring her.
most people can't dance with imaginary giants in front of others.
i always would have brought her.
i walked in crowds with him.
no, that's what you have to do.
call her in your bunker alone.
first take him out without a cut, then go out among the people.
i don't know if i can.
you have to.
without barry, what are you?
check this out.
you can't live your life like this.
you have no choice but to find barry.
they'll take her personality, her dna.
your brother-in-law loved your brother.
excuse me, i'll make my objections like this.
he won't bring cindy back.
even the only eggs, as they say, share the same dna, they're different people.
even when you take someone's organs, they need his permission.
the copy of the dna is much more aggressive.
it means entering their privacy.
i'm sorry.
mine?
i didn't mean to push.
it was a mistake.
don't you want to see your brother's genes continue?
she'll look like him, talk like him.
i wonder if she wouldn't want that?
he's been against genetic research all along.
she certainly wouldn't want that.
never.
you have a computer.
i want some privacy.
brazilla.
it's really gonna be our first conversation.
i feel so good about her.
but hurry up.
i'm the one who's gonna rub his rotten feet.
did you find barry white?
any signs?
forget it!
you couldn't find your own office?
yours is closer to court and my feet hurt a little.
i have no idea.
elaine!
things have been watching each other.
would you stop following me?
you think that's what i'm doing?
i didn't ignore you.
i thought you weren't interested.
you were right.
forget it, deja vu.
you've been angry ever since i came to this firm.
i'm angry because you lied to me.
i'm angry because i slept with you.
it's hard to walk around in happiness all the time.
it's hard to be cheerleader.
i don't understand why you do this every day.
obviously, from the start, we're both a little embarrassed.
then why don't we get a fresh start?
you might be right.
or not.
jackson.
how are you?
no complaints.
this is definitely ours, isn't it?
something's up.
yes, it is.
nobody, just you and me.
funny little guy, isn't he?
i don't mind.
just in time.
it's like being dr. frankenstein.
the idea of collecting organs?
choose dna?
these are awful.
we could have hockey teams filled with wayne gretzky copies.
they can connect mike tyson with a pit bull.
the odds.
horror.
but the truth is, every time science takes a new step, there are concerns about humanity's future.
we've already done tube babies, your honor.
we're playing with the genes.
this technology will save lives.
is there a risk of abuse?
sure, there is.
my client knows her wishes and dreams.
the dreams they had together.
this procedure will give you the chance to carry on the family fortune they hoped for.
we have to be open to science that will allow a couple to have children.
it's not about who owns her dna, is it?
i remind mr. paul that the wife in life can forgive the organs of the dead wife, without permission.
mr. paul, i'm just saying this in case he can say the wrong things about mrs. stoller's demands.
but we have no reason to believe that.
you can't be sure when you can talk.
now it's your turn.
i may not have a legal reason.
but i have a moral compass.
that's what it's about.
then why stop there?
he can clone his mother, too.
his grandfather.
one day, they can play with their grandmother's twin in a sandbox.
celebrities can start selling their dna.
imagine being parents to barry white's twin brother.
when you take the technology's location and you start to take control of the evolution, will the line be crossed?
once upon a time, we were afraid of heart transplants.
the tube baby idea was considered an abnormal.
now the truth of life and the community accepts it.
there are steps to clone organs, save life, destroy disease.
they could be real.
but to clone a human clone to copy a person's dna, copying medicine?
dismissed.
i'm sorry.
i appreciate your effort.
i don't want a rematch.
hi.
hi.
you come here often?
that's my entrance sentence.
a terrible entrance sentence.
has it worked before?
better.
want to go to the bar?
not tonight.
because you beat larry?
it's not that.
truth be told, i didn't want to win this time.
no, i want to be alone tonight.
alone with him.
not at all.
like you said, most people don't dance with imaginary disco giant.
you're not crazy.
actually, i'm kind of jealous.
when you're disappointed in the real world, you create things.
hey.
maybe the three of us can walk.
give it a chance.
if he doesn't, i'm still in.
well, i'll do it.
let's go.
who knew that karaoke night would be the most delightful party in the avenue?
you said it with p. diddy and kissinger?
all i'm saying is, "islands in the stream" never happened.
limo driver called and said...
embarrassed the wedding of millimillioner donald trump?
sam, i've been in vegas for 00 minutes, but i haven't even played a hand blackjack yet.
your favorite table is ready.
ladies love a good karaoke singer, danny.
call me.
you think you can get any girl you want?
get her.
it's a lonely mission, man.
she's here for a new virgin born convention.
girls who aren't technically virgins can change pure.
the card counters have hit two hotels this month and the last shift report says there's major loss on the blakjack table.
there's a card player downstairs.
ed thinks he might be a card counter.
maybe we can have this conversation later, like drinking.
patty, that's three and you've been here a week.
i didn't pay my rent and the reason the landlord let me stay...
listen, i'm sorry, but this is a business.
if we pay for every shirt you screw, i'm screwed.
all right, the gift bags are packed and waiting to go to the guest rooms.
our florist has brought the orchids and the other 0,000 will arrive tomorrow.
however, if for some reason he doesn't come, a ship for my tulips from amsterdam...
mary, don't worry.
i'm sure everything will be fine.
you're the most comfortable bride i've ever seen.
thanks for coming, galina.
that's a hundred grand dress.
a hundred thousand dollars?
like i said, it's first for me.
it's a lot more than what we lost.
playing with a certain duck does not mean anything.
numbers sit at a table and play if there are rich people, right?
the suspect lady, redhead, yellow dress, heading west.
thank you.
mr. sperreos, i'm with security.
the question i always ask.
we're not married yet, and you're staying out all night.
it's no good.
honey, i'm winning here.
tonight's over, and so is yours.
all right.
i told donald trump that our wedding should be a delicious chicken wing compared to the party at palm beach.
my team's been working on your wedding for months to make this city's greatest and most elegant wedding ever.
come on.
he was always the boss when he was a secretary.
why are you so helplessly romantic?
when your commission stops playing, montecito will still be in front of you, and that's all i care about.
let's go, guys.
the man with the tie said he told us to make the air conditioning fall a dozen times.
it can point the 00th floor and see the play is rich.
he sits all night in that slot machine there, rarely plays.
and he doesn't take his eyes off the blakjack tables.
sperreos is happy to stand up and win the game a minute before he enters a game.
you can't prove it.
even if i count the cards, it's not illegal.
that's technically true.
but we have a different sense of justice in vegas.
i can catch a cheat and destroy it in the desert like i used to.
i'll be honest with you, i'm old-fashioned.
please.
you're in the black book now because we have your picture.
you step back from montecito and i'll have you arrested in private.
hear that?
hey, jack!
he's offended us by 000,000.
you know as well as i do that the countess isn't illegal unless she has a machine, and she didn't have it.
at least we can have some fun with him.
it's not your story.
if someone's financing them and teaching them things, it's not the end of anything.
mike from last night, mystique.
the man without phoenix.
there are other cities you're not really from.
des moines, for example.
it's amazing, but i gotta go.
i'm devastating and devastating, aren't i?
you finally said something i joined up with.
i think it should be you, because i'm usually attractive.
then what?
maybe i'm a little nervous around you because you're so beautiful.
my tongue is being held.
you know what we do?
what?
we're gonna sit down and try to figure out why you're not having drinks.
patty.
almost there.
did they say i'm okay?
it doesn't matter whether you're okay or not.
i should fire you.
please.
thanks, thanks, thanks.
the tailor said he sent it back this morning, but there's no record of him getting there.
our 000 friends will come to this wedding tomorrow, president of the state, industry leaders, oprah.
do you want to tell oprah that the wedding was canceled and came to las vegas for nothing?
if we can't find it, montecito would be happy to take the same.
that dress was a fashion thing, a master.
a dozen french tailors sewed with a dozen of them.
there's no other one like that.
do you know how much that dress cost me?
that's a big problem, sam?
wait.
hey, danny, you asked me to look at the big blackjack winners.
montecito already spent millions on food, flowers, decor and entertainment.
if the wedding isn't as planned and lipworth refuses to give it.
you think someone actually stole it?
what's that thing worth on the street?
why not terzi galina?
she took care of the dress when she heard the price.
mike.
hey.
let me know how it goes.
are those the same techniques that sperreos and his team are using?
we catch a team, they send someone else in a few hours.
if we don't find what's behind this, we may have to give them the key to the safe.
you'd better fucking bastard.
are you talking to sperreos?
you'd better take your hands off'cause the president's assault on me will cause more than i've won from montecito.
that was good.
did i buy the dress?
i just want to know what happened.
i make changes and i give the dress to the montecito messenger.
is there a camera in the shop?
i saw real diamonds in a costume for elton john.
compared to that, this dress is nothing.
galina protects herself.
you're free to go.
i'm helping, patty.
god knows why i accepted this project?
i've always helped the baby bird, even if it's rabies.
then i'll get my tray.
this is christina, one of our best waitresses.
knees bent, back in trouble.
above all, trust.
trust.
his tray is filled with martinis with weight.
it's gonna be the slowest move.
she doesn't even look at glasses.
he believes in his ability to do the right thing and here he is.
black suit.
you're not so black.
breathe with me, patty.
be like booze, patty.
you want me to sit here until mystique opens?
thank god i don't want you standing here like a karate kid.
call me master.
vic, this morning, you sent one of your guys to the store to buy a dress.
yeah.
remember who you sent?
the tailor gave me a recording, but i couldn't remember the face.
bart, you went to the store this morning to pick up a dress.
no, i didn't.
why not?
when i was about to leave, joey stopped me, and he wanted to leave.
get joey's face and get his address for me.
thanks.
i'm sorry.
the treasure sea caviar.
why would he have her change her receipts?
did you hear from the dress?
yeah, candy.
who's candy?
not me, because i know you're not allowed here, but the others call.
do you know where we can find it?
danny mccoy, montecito surveillance and security.
how do you know nick sperreos?
cops don't scare me.
okay, wait, wait.
okay, fine.
that's enough.
okay, i know him.
she's been here several times with her friends.
are these his friends?
you know these?
yeah, i guess so.
nick's a good boy.
and she asked me to cash in the chips.
i guess she thought i wouldn't be suspicious.
strippers are always rewarded with receipts.
look, it was good for five minutes and there was no need to take my clothes off.
why are you so interested?
because sperreos and his friends are involved in some kind of card counting operation.
i thought they were just some rich kids.
someone is behind this and i need to find out who.
do you have any idea who's trained and financing these?
they came once with a bigger man.
yeah, they called him bucky.
mitch, did you scan joey's face?
fast forward.
somebody's paying him.
can you expand the picture?
no, but i can get another angle.
so, lipworth's fiancée lissy?
we need to talk.
but you already know, don't you?
i know you paid to get rid of that dress.
what i don't understand, why?
this wedding, details, std, cost, cost... cost...
listen.
it's kind of weird if you want to leave.
that's the point.
i don't know if i want to leave.
i love him but his life...
i mean, how many 000 people are my friends?
people say it's a cinderella story.
i'm not cinderella.
i'm just a normal new jersey girl.
i may not know much, but considering my wedding was 00 times more expensive than my parents' house...
that's not true.
it is.
jared and i are so different.
i mean, what harm could it do?
how old do you think these kids are?
00, no more than 00.
danny, the yearbooks you asked for.
we'll see.
they're all in their 00s and they all have math skills to count cards.
then there must be some kids from the math department who were trained and trained.
then i remembered how i could put them on the knee?
given how the second team got here, i started with local college.
because you're amazing, and i'm interested in the less attractive ones.
maybe it's time for a change.
listen, mike, there's something i need to say before we go forward.
i'm here to vegas for theen virginity kogram.
your upgrade.
i've made mistakes with the men in my past, so i wanted to make a clean slate, and i took a vow of chastity until i got married.
i mean, it wouldn't be worth less if i gave my gift before.
the marrying officer is beautiful.
good.
what's up?
do you want to go back to school?
i want to go back and do an anthropology degree, go to the rainforest and study the native locals.
you're an idiot.
what's up, ruben?
if you touch me, i'll call my lawyer right away.
call your lawyer?
what do you want?
where's bucky?
i don't know what you're talking about.
we have records of you robbing montecito.
i don't think the students here like that.
i can call the dean right now and get his ass out of here.
please don't tell my family.
hey.
hey.
have you heard of being born a virgin?
so you always knew about this?
i'm sorry, but i could get every girl that i wanted... and it just made the crap out.
yes, i set a trap with a very sweet and beautiful man.
you were gonna leave her because she wouldn't sleep with you.
hey, where are you going?
hey, mike.
i won't need you.
hey.
i was a real jerk.
i just needed time to spend the whole process.
do you think there's a place in your heart that can give me a second chance?
room service with whipped cream, baby?
excuse me.
what was all the precious gift events?
because to me, it's all rubbish over the christmas paper.
look, i was born again five or six times.
so why not me?
i tried to change.
so this is my fault?
i'm really sorry.
i took your advice.
i talked to jared and told him everything.
the wedding's off.
the wedding's off, not the marriage.
bucky training his team here?
hey, ruben, if it's funny, know your parents on the phone.
bucky.
mr. buckner?
you know him?
my high school math teacher.
i'm a security director in montecito.
yeah.
remember mrs. buckner?
last year, she ran away with coach kajoyan.
nafaka is killing me.
school debts.
but tax evasion is.
you guys made a lot of money in a lot of casinos.
i'm guessing some of that money wasn't reported to the tax office.
keep these card numbers out of montecito, and we'll forget what happened.
before these kids get out, danny's gonna take pictures and information.
what's the name of the food on the left?
oh, my god.
you miss the flowers, the towel and oprah?
you know i don't care about those things.
all that matters is spending the rest of my life with you.
delinda, i'm sorry.
she needs to listen to you, honey.
i'll make you a star.
_
careful, we're about to go in.
do i know you?
vinny's hanging out with your mom.
do you really want to risk your life for a skirt and a geezer?
any sign of the professor?
i know six languages, why... why...
stein will kill sara in the library.
the speedster is somehow entering stein's disguise and bringing the ship under it.
since when do you call him jax?
unfortunately, it won't last long.
what did you do to stein?
capone's men are taking over the ship.
you're here because i killed jsa's stupid leader.
mr. rex tyler, wasn't it?
i don't want to spend the night here.
you drunken freaks.
my work is better.
i'm in charge of the entire arena.
every night, 00,000 people come here to have fun, and i make sure they have fun.
are you an actor?
yeah.
okay.
tell springsteen i'm the boss here.
don't say that.
you say what you want.
have you seen a hot marketing director around here?
where were you, buddy?
i have a meeting after the game.
how much time do we have?
0 minutes, 00 seconds.
five minutes, i can do a lot of things in 00 seconds.
you're a funny girl.
i'm seeing other people.
i'm seeing other people.
happy birthday, ben.
how do you know?
morning.
all right.
happy birthday, ben.
you're the maintenance man, right?
two years ago, you told me to say "yes."
it's a little deceiving because you don't always ask yes or no questions.
forget i said that for now.
tonight there'll be circus, and if there's ice on the floor, those fire-fired guys will be lost in front of the kids, falling on their own truce.
understand?
you told me not to run in the hallway.
forget about the conversation we had two years ago.
oh, no, no, no.
he wants to talk.
that's not good, buddy.
melt this ice, bobert.
benjamin!
come here.
hurry.
crystal, before you get upset and start chasing everyone, about that ice...
have you seen a little white pill that says something spanish on it?
i don't understand your level of interest.
did i already take that pill?
hello.
yeah, i think you've already taken the pill.
i hate the circus coming here.
are they happy?
sorry?
why are their pockets so big?
i'm sure you're talking about clowns.
morning, beautiful people.
morning, alonzo.
you are in an incredibly wonderful mood again.
every day is a good day, my friend.
seriously, every day?
ben, that was the best day.
that was the day i stopped taking care of myself and started devoting myself to the wonderful people of san diego.
what are you doing?
i gotta get that pill out of my system.
what about the charity meeting today?
i invested a lot of money in illegal himalaya dog racing.
_
anyway, i have a himalaya nightmare.
can't we use that money to make this place better?
okay, you own this place, we'll do whatever you say.
did you see the oil painting?
don't forget to bring some kind of kid for a photo.
you know, black, white.
get an asian kid.
and we're gonna need a cup.
the asian boy will give me a cup.
you're right to clap because these are good ideas.
benjamin, i almost forgot.
your... son?
how's your new assistant, getting used to it?
thanks for that.
he set a guy on fire?
there was an investigation.
the evidence was insufferable.
i mean, yeah.
he's good, isn't he?
she set him on fire.
not very well.
a-a-al-al...
alonzo...
what do you think it means when a girl sends a message "we need to talk"?
i'm in the same thing.
i think you'll have a better chance of getting closer.
what could be better than that?
yeah, that's what i thought.
happy birthday, little man.
morning, heather.
morning.
i'll tell you why i fainted.
ben!
there's a man in your office, and he's very attractive.
okay.
hi.
hi.
is there anyone else here, someone more attractive than you?
no.
okay.
it's me.
i'm roman.
so you're crystal's son.
this must be awful for you.
yeah.
it sure isn't fantastic.
i wonder how they swam in the water.
okay.
i like mafia movies.
and as a... talent as...... as...
this place is exciting.
here's political meetings, sports, rodeo, night football, motorcycle racing.
aren't you interested in any of this?
remember me?
i've sent you three messages, and you haven't answered any of them.
i guess after five months of sleeping together, you should know the unanswered messages made me crazy.
look, i know we hate commitment.
i'll take this "date-related" as well.
but this morning, i woke up at your place alone, which means you snuck out of your house.
i couldn't find my underwear until i came out of my wallet while paying for coffee.
i got another coffee with this, more...
who is this?
i like a deep mob.
and you, i really need to talk to you.
yes, it is, because it's a chance of getting closer.
what could be better than that?
this is a good business opportunity for you.
i'll see you at the christmas party.
you don't mean that.
say it in spanish.
i speak a little spanish.
yeah, i don't know what you said.
actually, your english is pretty good.
elephant!
crystal.
did you hear what i just said?
i haven't heard.
let me see this conversation.
i don't think you should say "yay, black kids" in the open!
well, when should i say it?
i don't think you should say anything.
and i wouldn't sing the song either.
there's still ice.
yeah, i know.
it doesn't seem too sad to me.
this is your lifestyle.
you never wanted someone to be emotionally connected to you, wondering how you are, where you are, kissing you in the morning, waiting for you to get home.
what good is celebrating them for your birthday?
but you throw big parties on your own birthday.
i need to know that i will never be alone.
i'm not sure what i should do now.
you step on the gas, go.
thanks.
negroes, whites, asian and--
don't sing that song.
i think we should have dinner to celebrate my birthday.
that would be a good step to our relationship.
i think we should be together.
i'm willing to end this relationship.
why did you let me talk first?
you go first.
from now on, you go first.
remember when we said we were seeing other people?
alonzo?
he's my best friend.
she's wanted to live with me for a while.
he wants to connect.
wants to connect?
it's a man we're talking about, isn't it?
such a man.
look, i...
alonzo is an adult.
he cares about other people.
he asks questions about me, and he listens to my answers carefully.
what bothers me is that i thought the two of us were the same.
when you say you're emotionally damaged,...
how did he react when you told him?
he was a very happy man.
that'll blow him up.
live with me.
we can do the commitment.
honey, i'm not the right woman for you.
you're sweet, you're perfect for fun.
but no one can be the right person for you, because you're only thinking about yourself.
what was that?
i think it came through my head.
i can't be a frying master.
i guess so.
you know what the worst thing is?
i don't think of anyone but myself.
it's really impossible for me to take care of other people.
suddenly, i feel the need to connect, but i have no idea how to do this.
i'm in trouble, man.
kermit the frog, right?
yeah.
what about her?
i think it's a great song.
come on, man.
sunlight.
hi, ben.
hi.
he's a very attractive man.
sorry.
anybody know how to use an ax?
come on, clowns.
almost done.
keep breaking it.
good day.
where's the asian kid?
i specifically asked for an asian child.
there's an asian kid there.
alonzo.
yeah.
yeah.
thank you.
they've already stopped.
most of the time people ask me why i love children so much.
maybe it's because i never had my own child.
i believe that our children's happiness is what we want to live in, the community that lives in this society with the efforts of those who live in it.
they're our future and their prosperity is our most important effort.
when you want them to do something for you, they do it with enthusiasm.
or as i grew older, i began to believe that a life you lived only for yourself was empty.
i wasn't gonna say it, but i have to share a little song i've written in this particular situation with you guys.
if we put aside the musical part, it was really touching to talk.
sometimes it's really fun working with you.
i'm incredibly happy right now.
on three, everyone say, "thank you, crystal cohen."
two...
oh, my god!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
clowns with axes!
what a wonderful moment.
i noticed you left a little early.
hello again.
are you really okay?
i'm a little scared.
sure.
after all, it's perfectly normal to think you chose the right man.
i'm 000% sure i chose the right man.
all right.
what a wonderful moment.
i've never done this before.
what if i'm not ready?
what if she's just acting like she wants me?
what if she doesn't want me anymore after she has me?
of course she'll want you.
you have everything.
everything.
okay?
okay.
okay.
in fact, we can make love one last time.
hi, crystal.
i really want to make love to her.
i'll see what i can do.
can you pay attention to the poor kid you threw into the air?
luckily, i convinced them to publish this photo.
more than you kicking a cop.
less than sinking the mayor's ship.
great.
cool.
while we've got you,...
i want you to sit down with someone who's incredible to us here at the center of sunlight, with his juice and joy.
get in the car.
get in the car.
i'm sure you have a lot to talk about.
great.
happy birthday, ben.
thanks.
look.
what's your name?
dan.
thanks, dan.
i forgot.
have you seen alice?
in your office.
it was about work.
i...
i see what you mean.
what do you do in a situation like this?
i think i'm gonna run like my life depends on it.
yeah, that's what i'll do.
they set up surveillance cameras looking directly at paddy.
it melts in your mouth.
she rebels at everything you say.
this is ridiculous.
these guys realized by living with me, that dee was so cool and so funny.
dee, you're undercover, okay?
dee, we're taking you to charlie's post, but for what we're taking, arrogance and questions?
maybe go to the private office upstairs.
do i have to know the guy who spaghetti his face?
i'll buy one for the guy i don't know behind my back.
i told you why.
'cause i think you've been pretty long the last time.
i didn't get it because charlie got the goddamn emergency lunch in half.
i don't want to be hit by something you've hit.
as i told that a few minutes ago, our fish today are exhausted.
instead, we'll all get a plate of hot spaghetti.
and extra sauce.
i've always wanted to see that.
comedians, baseball players, even protestors.
god bless the pie and america.
look, i'm an experienced businessman with a long history of asian countries.
imagine my delicious cream pie recipe, with your low-priced labor force.
because of all the accidents i've had, the factory was shut down for a few days.
the truth is, we're pretty good at the chinese factory.
i don't think you need to worry in a good situation.
just old porn information.
all aboard the tucker train.
well, it's not exactly what it looks like.
oh, no.
these are the things my children care about when they're young.
besides, you know when you can't sell these nasty things in the garage.
these boxes show how great our lives are.
like they always fake ids you?
pictures of me in the main school and thanksgiving turkey hand?
i'm sorry, honey.
i'll put the finger here, because i have a feeling something's changed here.
it's not just danny wearing a jersey and hitting the bat.
they were in the basement with christmas lights, and i realized miss bart lost her shiva.
i just didn't see you have a plan to win.
yeah, you gave us free beer and then you said "vote for me."
we're very lucky that everyone was taken back.
i'm not really into sports anymore.
god, it feels like it's from another life.
i have to hit things with a stick for beer.
okay, brawlers, i'd like to propose a pre-game toast.
maybe we'll remember that winning isn't everything, but we have a keg beer!
wait.
everybody, this is riley and my daughter emma.
i mean, wheeler's up 0-0 on unscanned pregnancy.
tuck, why don't you give the new guys something?
ben!
that's what i know.
are you going out with mom?
i was gonna talk to her myself, but bonnie said she was gonna handle this.
i did, but i didn't tell him.
you can't say you're taking it well.
i mean, your mom and coach can have a pillow talk in bed after date.
if i had called the girl you were happy with hours ago, we'd be happy to have your voice cut off.
we could have more babies.
i'm going to practice until my brain falls off.
she's throwing food around, and i think she's doing fine.
her father's daughter.
mom will be back soon, will you take the equipment downstairs to the field for me?
that's more than my weighty old one.
you don't care about the cups on the shelf, do you?
sounds like i missed the game.
you missed another little thing.
the children voted riley captain.
i was saying it was a complete loss.
i was feeding my baby and you took my team away.
i was wearing gloves... and then everyone started yelling.
"you're amazing!"
because i heard it was amazing.
maybe you could do some good things i haven't done in a long time if you'd come to my place.
because i don't care what the others say.
" face to face, parasites." i'm so excited!
we just had some italian food.
that's why i'm trying to stop you.
honey, i don't think we should talk about these parts, these things about my personal life.
okay, honey, i know you don't want to hear this, but i'm a woman and i have needs.
even if i don't say my mouth.
"to wear it."
i don't want anyone to call off their plans.
thank you, danny.
not yet, but it will be solved.
honey, are you okay?
i tried to come as soon as i could.
my hair and this, you're only 00 minutes away.
i couldn't call anyone to look after emma.
the dentist said i should see you right away.
and before you forget, don't bring home the giant toothbrush.
it's for the bathroom key.
i'm sorry about your date with hank.
i shouldn't even be talking to you right now.
please tell me emma was outside in the car in the park.
hank canceled something, i don't know the details.
but if mom asks, they hid me here.
you care about other people's happiness.
to make her not see and hope she doesn't understand.
dude, you need to get back.
you think she stopped being rigantor?
am i going to have little planets whispering through my head?
will you look here?
the minister went home.
if hank doesn't have a job, he'll be like somebody else.
do you have menu here?
mom, i'm home.
what are you doing here?
i'm sure it's my robe.
hank, ready for round two?
danny, there's nothing going on here.
you're unbelievable.
yeah, she hates that.
because we're not watching the same game here.
it's actually full of vodka.
we'll drink this and throw it away.
we have a chance to make a clean shot.
sit down, wheeler near the other ladies.
what about riley?
okay, tuck, your turn.
strike again, don't get out of the area.
when i told riley something she shouldn't have heard earlier, she ate my crayons.
i still can't forget you ate the brown.
don't worry, i'll watch your back, okay?
hey, teammates.
don't you think she looks cute today?
is that my phone?
something about the play.
thank god.
i was worried i wouldn't get you back.
i know what you're thinking, but you gotta do something besides checking the team.
like i just did?
i want you to be more serious in the games.
i'm having a hard time putting you on the squad.
to tell you the truth, i have to throw you off the team.
but i can't.
i'll really miss you when you're not playing.
thank you.
what did you want to tell me?
just... just... just... just...
"take it, riley's gone.
" ben's firing him now."
what's that?
this is the bad version of what i just told you.
coach, can we talk?
i think you want your robe back.
it didn't... it didn't
mom told me what happened.
i'm really sorry about that reaction.
next time, i'll say i'll be better.
i don't think it'll be next.
don't blame him for being a dick.
so you keep a funny woman out of your league?
no, that's my mom you're talking about.
and someone who goes out with him is very lucky.
i'll go out with him.
it'll be safe if you take him down.
what's wrong with me?
maybe you're just too smart and too beautiful.
winning is fun for you.
oh, my god, i like this!
but what will it get me?
that your room is filled with cups and no one is sharing it with me?
looks like danny figured it out.
yeah, well, neither of us will be like your brother.
yeah, i think i've heard it a couple or a thousand times.
right.
right.
i was thinking about a change for the win.
i've never tried it before.
yeah, i think you should figure out how to uncover the real brawlers without me.
ben, nobody wants me.
go brawlers!
all thanks to my dear assistant captain.
riley hadn't been with the referee.
she would really need a new glass.
no, i can't hide anymore.
honey, you have to help me.
the fear in their eyes caused them to close.
get lost.
don't worry.
i'll find a man who can make you happy.
okay.
it seems to be getting better.
i know when i see my son at work.
as i always say, thank god for giving me ben.
do wheeler, wheeler...
what's riley doing?
they call him wheeler.
we'll use you to monitor this from the inside.
why was patty interested in this murder?
i suggest mr. purcell not to answer any more questions.
you found your wife's body at home alone.
no sign of forced entry.
patty, i saw the guy who did this.
our firm was hired to do toxicological research on a chemical compound.
these corporations are worth billions of dollars.
michael, this is daniel purcell.
we have a containment problem.
head counselor of the world's third largest energy producer.
did you tell anyone about us?
the acid rain from the coal-burning operator makes their bullet levels 00 times the national average.
the locals tried to sue a class action.
so they've had more than 000 cases in their rights over the past three years?
why didn't he bribe you?
i wonder the same thing, but i don't know how patty knew we were setting tom up.
what did you find out about purcell?
we need to make sure our secret is still open to progress.
it's okay with me.
ellen, i know it's disappointing, but you have to back off.
we'll all retreat.
it might help me.
i have no experience in criminal law.
we must have chased him before we could find time to steal something.
the first time was dark.
you know, last night, i was wondering if somebody snooped up the houses.
isn't that your job to find out, detective?
let's see if there's anything in the photos that can revive your memory.
mr. purcell didn't come here to be harassed.
always has.
this is a very important development, mr. purcell.
you find the ring, you find my wife's killer.
mr. purcell, i believe you.
because whoever killed christine is still out there somewhere, and you certainly have no use for it.
you can't use these against me.
don't answer that.
i swear you're acting like you want to get arrested.
the only thing that happened three years ago is not possible.
no, but she seems to be lying about everything.
i mean, he's been in his house twice and there's nothing stolen.
wasn't the contaminant damage to health?
we spoke on the phone a couple times, but i guess she's still not accepting it.
she wants to introduce me to the man she was with.
if there's anything we need to know, patty will tell us when she's ready.
whatever you've got the company on, it better not get out of the stolen documents.
if you're wondering what happened to christine purcell, look at the grieving widow.
my only job is to protect mr. kendrick and if you've done anything to expose him or ultima nationalources... or if you have done...
everything okay in new york?
daniel purcell, i'm seeing patty hewes.
do you have reason to believe that ultima national resources was involved in the murder of your wife?
i've watched many farm animals die now.
00 years ago, he used daniel purcell as an expert witness and he won a case.
then why did ibc global's report say that 000 parts of millim was acceptable?
daniel purcell was a brilliant man, but when he confronted patty, he collapsed.
no, this is just another big conspiracy that needs to be uncovered.
as soon as i tell you what i know about ultima national, you throw me away.
whatever she tells you, you can't trust her.
i don't know who killed your wife, but you're gonna get blamed for it.
he and purcell worked together before ibc global.
nine months later, michael was born from upstairs purcell's testimony.
just the two of them.
we will meet unexpected elements.
we will neutralize them with a major attack.
on three.
one, two, three.
shoot them!
detective stark?
excuse me.
yeah.
that guy over there.
and did you pull him out on the 00th?
am i sworn?
i'd appreciate it if you would stop asking me that.
mr. young was the one you pulled over on the 00th?
i don't see if you don't say it again.
what?
do you know what this is, you son of a bitch?
it wasn't a real bomb.
"no blood, no crime."
not legally, detective.
even with a bomb threat is a clear physical threat.
terrible build.
i think what's terrible is your shirt.
your honor, we demand the rejection of the case.
liz, i don't know what to say.
he's your partner, jack.
that's not a reason, jack.
we've been trying to catch wayne young for years.
liz, i...
jack, what are you gonna say?
i need to be alone.
you want some chips?
no, i don't want chips, dan.
i think they put spices in it.
it feels better.
you fucked the case dan...
but it's a state case.
you mean your ex-boyfriend's case?
they're finishing the investigation.
that means no more department income.
department income?
and fight crime against sticks?
you need financial resources for an investigation.
you know what?
good luck.
you'll see.
good day to you all.
see you in hell.
here it is.
i thought you might remember that.
you're absolutely right.
hey, you got any nikotine gum?
i can't think of myself without them.
because i left those cancer sticks.
that's it.
okay, we need to do some errands.
first, i need to get myself a pump.
you misunderstood!
there's a misunderstanding!
please!
i made a deal when you were in prison.
the same for both of us.
what kind of deal?
heroin.
near south america.
i put it in one of our trucks.
i have a client.
and it's only the beginning.
if it works, we'll get more heroin.
wayne, you and me are so close!
you meet the guy and we deliver.
what about the cops?
they can't come after you cross the border!
cops can do nothing!
rough day?
yeah.
is it a girl or a job?
you're gonna need a second donut.
hey, dan.
what's up?
of course.
i'll bring liz up to this in the morning.
i'll call you back.
don't move!
okay.
okay.
don't move!
i'm not moving!
why are you attacking me?
_
i have three arrest warrants about me.
coping is not the first thing to do.
that's what i want to talk to you about.
what would you feel if the arrest warrant was lifted?
"don't mind"...
"julius, you don't have to go to prison"?
because that's what it came to me.
i'm all yours, man.
you can do whatever you want.
i want information about wayne young.
i know him.
i know wayne young.
anything?
all i want is a piece of paper, pen and writing...
do it.
oakwood has a place, okay?
that's it.
does that make us good?
we're gonna put him in jail...
we're fine.
okay.
because i want to embrace you.
you can hug.
all right.
thanks a lot, man.
okay.
okay.
what can i do for you, jack?
i was talking to dan...
which means everything by the book...
not exactly your partner's style.
actually, that's why i can send her home.
don't worry about it.
just give me some information to fight wayne.
okay.
i'll see you at the office at 0:00.
wayne was working in a garage in east dallas.
he works for a company like shell.
but what do we arrest him for?
we'll think of something when we get there.
no, dan.
we'll do an investigation.
yeah, that'll work.
meanwhile...
how did you find out where wayne was working?
am i still sworn?
this is the address.
hello!
it's weird.
what did you say we go in and check out the truck?
and this?
do we respond without permission?
they should know that security is terrible.
besides, nobody comes in here without a helmet.
you mean us?
hey, ours is a breach.
it's only after you've spent over $0.00.
so it works for me.
she's like a law woman... a law
it pisses you off, but it doesn't do anything to calm you down.
everything gets worse.
what is this place?
what are they doing here?
we don't know...
i have to call liz.
just... just... just... just...
dan, what are you doing?
dan, we can't be here.
what you did was illegal, dan?
okay?
this truck is full of boxes.
yeah.
crime boxes.
come on.
we're on a 00-foot thing.
i can feel the leaking in my trouble!
another excuse for the report.
listen, dan.
we got a bad start here, okay?
did you hear anything?
start the car.
i'll turn it off.
dan, this is an illegal investigation, okay?
if we get caught, we're in big trouble!
your phone's ringing.
god!
i hate this.
hello.
hello, detective dan.
i'm julius, man.
how's our parole agreement going?
hey, i can't talk now.
i'm behind wayne young's truck.
long story.
there's a big gunman...
paco.
looks like things are going well.
glad you didn't blow my head off with a shotgun?
it was just a little misunderstanding, wasn't it?
yeah.
let's make some money.
yeah, me too.
shit!
what the hell is that?
thanks for coming.
i'm dying slow.
you look good.
i'm not okay.
you know the parole i made.
the cop i made the deal was trapped in one of wayne young's trucks.
there's no truck in there!
i mean, i have a boyfriend in jamaica.
maybe we can come back here and open a motel.
but why am i here?
you'll introduce me to wayne young.
you two are friends, he...
that's a very deep word.
we're more like colleagues, man.
she wanted me to take her to north sometimes, that's all.
skeeter, dear...
you need to find this truck, and you need to find it now, man.
look, i'll give you $000.
this guy's murder, man!
he cut a man's thumb once!
her fingers were lost!
that's disgusting, dude!
i love this car.
including the sound system?
and the jants?
you can take them too.
you can have the ashtray, skeeter.
just get the truck for me, okay?
all right, i'll help you find the truck.
i didn't mean to yell at you.
there's the real joke.
they won't examine the whole cargo.
what the hell was that?
don't panic.
dan, this is texas, okay?
you just described 00,000 square miles.
god damn it!
then we break the door so we can jump out.
what's wrong with what?
physics, dan.
it's suicide.
not if you jump fast enough, man.
we'll take the truck speed down to zero.
come on.
why are you acting like a bad thing?
we found wayne young right where we want him.
yeah.
two lousy parking lot out of the country.
exactly.
this is detective jack bailey.
please leave a message, i'll call you again
well, it's been 00 minutes.
congratulations.
you're going the same way as your partner.
still waiting for your boyfriend?
detective bailey is not my girlfriend.
jack.
wherever you are, i hope you're having fun.
all i know is they're somewhere in the south.
how are you?
thanks a lot.
man, what took you so long?
dude, you asked me to find a criminal, right?
can we just focus, please?
where's the truck with the police?
this way.
so i just go this way?
what about that road?
i'm working on the ropes.
dude you...
i think she's got a deal with a guy.
dude, you're gonna kill me.
you'll definitely kill me.
you know anything else?
i heard it was a scary look.
and it's not from this country.
we can make the deal on thursday.
i'm not british.
i'm from south africa.
yeah, there's a giraffe in south africa.
see you thursday.
that's it.
coming with you wasn't part of our agreement.
hey.
do you want my car or not?
yes, i do.
that's what i thought.
thank you.
good night.
you have interesting friends, man.
he was wearing weird boots, man.
i have those boots!
yeah.
what else was i supposed to do?
we're partners, right?
you would have done the same for me.
any other deals?
anything i should know?
that's it.
dan, what are you doing?
good luck.
i'll be right with you.
what are you doing?
don't i look like someone who's trying not to go crazy?
apparently.
i haven't opened it all yet.
are you calling scented, especially?
let me ask you something, dan.
like i said, these boxes are full of crimes.
yeah...
are you thinking about helping?
this has to be a little bit more light.
mysterious sunrise.
natural.
i like that.
don't die on me, dan.
don't die on me, dan.
don't die on me, dan.
dude, would you shut up?
i'm trying to talk to the phone!
yeah.
sort of.
in lubbock, "lill an antique shop."
i don't know, man.
it's like a souvenir shop.
besides...
god.
i've learned some information about the south american man.
excellent.
just focus on where the deal's going.
save the moustache.
save the moustache.
the smell of the candles began to drown me.
they smell like mysterious sunrise.
i think i'm gonna throw up.
i'll light more candles if you puke.
no.
give me that.
at least 0 kilos.
heroin.
it's heroin.
high purity.
small particles.
probably asian.
wow, you know a lot about heroin.
thank you.
so you're saying you planned this?
it's a team effort to be a cop.
and you, jack.
that's how we ended it together.
really?
we'll call it, "fetch it, and get it again."
bad cops only chase the criminal with a gun in their hands.
the good cops, they're in a team, chasing criminals with guns.
thanks for the career advice.
hey, listen, dan...
what?
truck stopping.
why are we here so early?
what kind of trouble did you have to pick a place like this?
this little town is in full states.
i mean, 000 miles from the nearest police.
there's no way we're getting caught.
we're not even here.
just in case.
hello.
don't worry about men with guns.
mikkel likes to carry heavy weapons just in case.
i'm not worried.
it's so good to see you.
looks like we're gonna do a little work here.
put the pump down.
on your knees.
excuse me?
i said, "get down on your backs."
hey, hey, hey, hey cowboy.
what you did here...
what the hell is going on here?
i'm sorry, wayne.
i made a deal, you son of a bitch!
everybody wins.
exactly.
what?
okay.
okay.
there's no confusion.
how was the meeting?
neither is believable.
we'd better shoot them both.
son of a bitch.
i should have killed you when i had the chance.
enough!
let's get this over with.
_
open the van.
smell that?
come on!
come on!
remember, stick to the plan.
just the two of them.
we will meet unexpected elements.
we will neutralize them with a major attack.
come on!
what the hell?
do you have a plan "b"?
run!
shoot them!
the traitor, the foxy son of a bitch!
i don't like plan "b"!
isn't it a little early for you to come visit here, counselor?
i heard about the dan stark makeup fiasco.
what happened?
it's about detective bailey.
she often comes to warm places.
i found an address last night at jack's desk...
hey!
we had a deal!
good day.
looks like you're in a bit of trouble.
not as much as it looks.
i think we're safe for now.
don't say "we're safe" again!
let's go!
who are these guys?
i don't know, and i don't care.
just kill them and bring me the heroin.
cover me.
i'll call the lieutenant and call for backup.
lieutenant ruiz.
yes, lieutenant!
i'm detective bailey!
you haven't checked in in six hours.
where the hell are you?
it's a long story, okay?
detective stark and i need backup.
send as many people to code 0!
"lil's an antique shop."
it's 00 minutes away from lubbock.
all right, we're under heavy fire!
that's five hours away, detective.
what the hell are you doing there?
long story.
just as many men as you can send, okay?
we're too late, man.
we're too late.
this stupid deal happened five minutes ago.
where's the address?
there must be somewhere around here.
man, come on.
here?
yeah.
she stayed behind.
we just passed.
it's not a secure driving style!
you can talk about my driving.
backup's in 00 minutes.
that sounds about right.
we gotta get the bad guys in the backup team.
we'll cross the road with the cavalry.
good idea, dan.
right here.
come on!
if we're going to die, it must be in a real car!
ready?
i'm waiting for you to say "let's go."
let's go!
get in the car!
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
don't you know how to make a contact?
what did they teach you at the academy?
go!
go, go, go, go!
motherfucker!
you!
can't you make this go any faster?
he had a good engine!
this car is dead!
maybe we should have taken sedan.
want some?
dan, when did you get that chocolate?
i went back to the shop when you were on the phone.
almond nuts...
motherfucker!
i want that heroin!
i don't think it's a very good situation anymore!
what, you don't think i already know?
take it!
come on.
come on!
hang on.
good!
that's exactly what i wanted.
that's what scared me.
no one's moving.
i think we're all safe now.
see what i see?
looks like a fire truck.
got it!
i dropped it!
get down!
are you okay?
yeah, i'm fine.
but i just got better.
yeah.
bastard!
got it!
_
jack.
partner, we have a bigger problem.
lower your weapons.
where's heroin?
you're lying!
she's not lying.
we left him in the middle of the road.
"paco" took him away.
who are you?
what were you doing behind the van?
we're officers.
are you a cop?
are you kidding?
i'm not.
julius!
you did it!
i'll explain later.
can i hug you?
yes, you can.
come on!
okay.
you better get out of here.
register your weapon!
what was all this?
we're embraced.
i'm a hugger.
it was like a walnut fuselage number 00.
anyway, he ran right here...
no sign of paco.
and heroin?
no sign of him either.
looks like he got away with it.
you don't have any witnesses.
and wayne young will testify against paco.
and i'm sure he'll say...
"and i'm gonna drag that penny into hell with me."
well, that'll do.
yeah, but you know what's not gonna work?
i didn't mean to get involved in that.
it just happened.
you came all this way worried about me?
no.
i came all this way to see wayne young get arrested.
i'm so sorry, jack.
well, i stole a sports car and set the van on fire.
did you think about that too?
we're questioning the south african man.
did you know the giraffes live there?
feast has come.
we stole the pure heroin, okay?
it's hard to accept as a victory.
"l can't say we lost. "
what do you mean?
don't say "we're safe" again!
cover me.
i'll call the lieutenant and call for backup.
yes, lieutenant!
i'm detective bailey.
it's a long story, okay?
send as many people to code 0!
hey, old...
sorry about the fight.
how much is this gatekeeper?
five dollars.
that's a brick.
that's the paint.
i'll give you three dollars.
okay.
here you go.
three dollars.
how much is a chocolate bar?
that's 00 cents.
why would i do that?
i was hungry.
i'm not saying chocolate.
what made you change the package?
well, you said everything was gonna go by the book, right?
yeah.
exactly.
i won't waste your time.
i brought you the best merchandise.
this is the best heroin money can buy.
that's comfortably $000,000.
top price.
here.
"remember the alamo"?
well, listen.
stop.
wayne young got caught in 00 hours and...
all $0.00.
actually, $0.00.
all i have to do is...
like i said, being a cop is a team effort.
but most of it is not like a desert of water.
hunters here spend their lives looking for rare and difficult prey.
000 tons of weight is the biggest animal that's ever lived with 00 feet long.
despite their enormous size, the blue whales are the most aerodynamic and energic.
they can travel over 000 miles a day in hartas.
it takes an awful lot of effort to open your giant mouth, so it only does when you see a rich, dense crop.
here, feeding opportunities are usually so rare.
when it's all over, the hunters must keep searching.
the frigates are pirates of the open sea.
the frigates must be very light because they can't have heavy oils that waterproof the feathers of other sea birds.
the little fish try to hide in the ocean's only protection waves.
with the extra firepower in their tails, the flying fish can take off more than one time.
with a good wind, they can float hundreds of metres.
all open ocean hunters can't walk around looking for food.
she can barely swim.
this brown seaweed has to lie in the ambush, protected by yossun.
in this ocean with no particular qualities, these ducks will get a lot of wild fish who want to hide.
it's the first chance in weeks.
he can only make a move when he's a few inches away from his prey.
trusting his perfect camouflage, he hides in the seaweed.
the open ocean is so vast that some hunters can only find their prey by searching as a team.
dolphins live in highly advanced social groups.
they can cover a wide area of the ocean together.
small groups sometimes come together and make up to 0,000 superpowers.
they use some kind of "kolocation" to find their prey.
but these little fish spend most of their time in the deep ocean, where dolphins can't reach.
they only hunt when they come up to the surface to feed.
when they find a lot of them, dolphins use their radar for another purpose.
as dolphins feed, they're approaching from the bottom of the herd to prevent their prey on secure depths.
as you go down, food is scarce than on the surface, so hunters must do everything in their power to protect precious energy.
most are just dragged by trace of lethal injections filled with lethal needles.
the others, in the formidable order of their hairs, are slow enough to drive into the darkness.
beroe is the ultimate jelly in deep waters.
beroe has special jelatinimissi aircraft, similar to teeth, in the mouth to capture its prey.
this deep water squid uses long sticky tongues to hunt.
the open ocean may be a wide blue desert, but like every desert, they have savages.
the sea will force the depth of the deep ocean stream to the surface of the nutrients, turning upwards towards the surface.
success here depends on delicate maneuvers.
hiding his tactic in a proper sight, giving his prey a false sense of security to his prey.
the lions' lions' strips are visually confusing, and it's hard to tell how close she is for her prey.
and the exaggerated fins that he used to hide his slow tail moves make him even better.
and these deep water tides which bring so many calm, also attract visitors to these savages.
they travel hundreds of miles between the sea mountains, where they're used as a gleaning point in the unknown ocean.
both kinds of sharks travel between galapagos and the other starfish east of the great ocean.
nobody knows exactly why they're packing up so many packs, but some of it definitely comes to looking for food.
if these little fish stay close to the rich, dogs can't access them.
as long as they keep the silver fish close to the ocean floor, they can get the predators out of their heads.
there's never easy food in the open ocean.
here, the storm is exposed to the storm, carrying nutrients to the surface, creating isolated areas to stabilize.
the dark-haired albatros is the same size as frigate birds, but three times as heavy, so he needs a completely different flight style.
albatros has the longest wingspan of bird, and that allows the southern arctic sea winds to overcome power.
first, they glide against the wind, use their energy to get high.
and then they turn around, click on the wind, win speed.
they spend weeks at sea on search for prey without ever returning to land.
because the winds are so strong here the albatross can't afford the weight that makes their feathers waterproof.
they can dive like ducks by a meter, so they connect their prey to the southern sea where they can move their prey into range.
like all birds, albatros have to eggs on land, but in the south atlas ocean, they have very few available islands, very crowded.
he comes here every year to raise half a million albatros puppies.
adults come back a few days to feed their young, sharing parenting duties.
when the feed is over, it's time to head out to the sea.
albatrosses are so heavy, they can only take air from where the wind is strong enough.
from the air, the ocean may seem unlikely, but beneath the surface, there are strong tantrums that are constantly moving.
these tides are more efficient than any other force to determine the distribution of life here.
every organism that's drifting in the ocean is based on these flow.
they'll come together to feed on fresh plankton, brought to the floating vegetables and small plant and animals.
the feathers are slowing down their thighs and on the back of your head, they're still feeding on the surface with a couple of tail hits.
the tide carrying these wandering crabs is also the highway business for the great predators of the ocean.
with flawless aerodynamic structure, they can make the longest distance with asgari effort.
these hunters are pouring the shuttle between the oceans where the hunt often met.
each predator has a sensible sense of smelling, which can detect unpredictable signs of prey.
the great shoals charm the plankton bolt.
a sardine pack could be miles long.
self-defense depends on my description.
when the attack comes, the sardines move like one body.
every fish instantly matches the movement of the man next to him and the whole pack of them move in as perimeter.
even when more sea lions arrive, they don't seem to break the sardines' coordinated defense.
a lot of sea lions that size are supposed to separate into smaller control groups.
but with so few predators, the fish still have the advantage.
all the sea lions can do is keep the sardines on the surface and wait for others to join them.
tuna attack from below so that sardines will cut off the deep water escape.
as the fish squeeze the pure, their strategy now makes it easier for the hunters.
tons of sardines run out in less than an hour.
the predators once again disappear into the blue of their ways.
this blue whale is still searching for food to remove its blown hunger.
because he's so big, he has to find three tonnes of food a day.
because of the fish, it's a crowded strawberry herd.
this blue whale has finally found what he's been looking for so long.
a meal big enough to make your big mouth worthwhile.
the crop's hundreds of metres long, and it's cooped to the bottom.
targeting the most intense part of the whale is moving in the game.
because it takes so much effort to swim with a fully expanded throat, the whale's going into a standstill.
the whale water uses its tongue to throw the water out of your mouth, and the cracks that line up on the jaws of your chin adds up to your hair.
but it takes time to shed so much water.
blue whales may not be as agile as the other hunters, but they don't have to be.
no other predator is more elegant than to exploit the rich in the messy mess of the open ocean.
the blue whale is the biggest hunter in all the world's oceans.
the open oceans made a lot of trouble to the "av" crew.
success turned into a two-year mission.
the team worked with john calambokidis, the world's most important blue whale expert in the world.
john got vital information from these harmless labels.
well, part of this research and part of the reason that we're working with filmmakers is that it's a unique chance that we can't get us any more scientific information.
so we're doing this under our research permit to get an idea of what they're doing underwater, how they're diving, how they're floating, how they're feeding.
the team's success depends on a good six visibility.
lazy and whale literally disappears into the darkness.
we couldn't.
the first year was badly affected by your vulnerability, and the shoot failed.
second year sea conditions are better.
before the blue whales dive in 00 minutes, they're only going up to a 000 minutes.
the boat must try to move forward to the whale, but not in front of it.
then he's got to get in the water and hope the whale passes close enough to get a record.
the water is unorthodox this year, but it still takes time to keep david in a good position.
after weeks of efforts, all the elements finally come together and give david the chance of a lifetime.
it was heavy ahead of me, long time ago.
i mean, it was really big, like a freight train.
underwater blue whale images are very rare, so it's a tremendous achievement to record a simply floating whale.
this series is all about hunting, i mean, it's a great shot, but to complete the part, we need to get the footage of the blue whale eating krill.
and we're gonna have to wait for the krill to get to the surface.
once a month, maybe twice.
the team has come across a promising sign, but it's a very unpleasant source.
look at those birds in the water!
we'll go check it out.
look at you!
i still don't understand what i just saw.
david saw her, turned the camera.
he took a turn, went upward and got a big bite.
the reason they call them blue whales is because you see them underwater, they come out of the blue of the ocean with bright, flaming cobra blue colors of cobalt blue.
i was upstairs trying to get another vision of the krill, and, honestly, the mouth was revealed one last time.
well, it was probably less than ten minutes, but undoubtedly, undoubtedly, recklessly, the most fascinating thing i've ever seen.
sharing water with a blue whale and being able to ignore, something i will never forget.
and the opposite turn.
yeah, that's a unique perspective we'll never see.
because of this close cooperation, the team have taken blue whales into the movie like they've never seen before, and eventually began to expose the greatest killer in the ocean.
you like her!
no, i don't.
every friend i meet without exception likes her.
it's sad, isn't it?
when mia went on exchange, we made a list of pros and cons, and it helped clarify our feelings.
yes, ethan karamakov...
abigail sent the pros and cons to the entire school.
look, i'm coming to stay with you for a while.
no, i won't get you in trouble.
i won't stay forever.
okay.
double fresh frappies.
and petit batment.
everyone thinks farm is a dangerous place.
relieve.
i know every rabbit hole, broken fence and rusty nail.
and nice arm rings.
no matter where i am, i'm safe.
your wife inside, tara.
and blance.
everyone, come forward.
tara, you can join us.
but the academy is a completely different world.
if you think you know your way, think again.
you'll realize you're in a minefield.
everywhere i turn up i see a new trap...
"it smells like christmas...
"the way he eats.
everything he's talking about is right.
could it be worse?
yeah, you ask...
at least i'm not the first minus on your list.
i guess i should be grateful for that.
i'm really sorry, kat.
i didn't mean to involve you in my confusion.
believe me, i tried so hard not to feel this way.
here's a good reason.
my brother will break your heart, and when he does, i won't be there to fix the pieces.
i promise i'll stay away from her.
you think abigail sent it to third grade?
ethan did.
kill me.
yes, a question for you.
who can tell me the real meaning of "pas de de de de deux"?
pas deux.
it means match dance.
but what does it mean beyond french words, metaphorically?
pas deux.
two bodies, one soul.
a man and a woman dance with pure emotions.
today's lesson is about that.
i've never danced with a man before.
that's right.
at home, girls used to dance with girls.
there were no men.
first-class men are just pretty creatures who crush their fingers.
pas deux has three important rules.
trust.
throw it at somebody.
tie.
great great great wonder wonder wonder wonder wonder
and, most important of all, communication.
without these, yes...
ethan, isabelle, it's kind of nice of you to join.
remember, to be together, you have to trust and communicate.
do your hands always stick like that?
i'm allergic to you.
focus on who you're dancing with.
nobody else should matter.
you want to drop it?
relax.
you're doing very well.
what a great lesson?
i mean, patrick is such a wonderful teacher.
don't you think the universe is trying to bring us together?
la-la-la-la-la.
before we left, we talked to miss raine that you and i wouldn't teach for the rest of your days.
don't get excited now.
instead, you're doing an exercise for me.
don't forget, you'll be considered this exercise exactly as you have in your other lessons.
that was a blow!
i'll be out walking a dog with a blindfold.
at least you don't have to spend 00 hours with abigail like me.
i'd rather stab my eyes with a blind blade.
i know. 00 questions for our wives in 00 hours.
this?
"you may ask each one of you a question
"but you must answer properly."
like i want to know something about christian.
so you're not alone.
burcuium, my favorite food is pizza, lucky number, and we're done.
i know everything about you.
your life's being broadcast to the whole school.
where are you going?
the beach.
i love this city.
i want to check it myself.
i'm going to go find christian.
we'll be there, checking out the pretty girls.
great!
oh, i'm starting to like this paper.
are you a hunter or something?
so where did you grow up?
a suburbs.
near the beach?
you're lucky.
you think i'm rich?
do you have brothers or sisters?
he lives in brenoken hill.
i meant emotionally close.
i mean, it's made of flesh and blood.
he's doing something.
you have to answer.
says who?
the rules.
how far did you go with a man?
there's stage one.
and there's a second stage.
anybody in your city?
have you ever kissed a man?
you didn't, did you?
maybe i can help you.
maybe you can get out of my sight.
hey, there were more questions.
and i'm trying to strengthen my belly here.
we can do these on the beach.
i don't come to the beach.
are you allergic to fresh air?
i don't like sand, i don't like salt, and i don't like sun.
great.
i need water.
me too.
we hate you enough to ask you to die of thirst.
i don't care what his favorite color or family does.
so did she say anything to you?
he did it!
_
"it'll be fun!"
i didn't know she'd be here.
really.
what are you doing here?
third grade, we come to our own.
you're not supposed to be here right now.
you can play with us if you want.
i may be blindfolded, but i'm not blind.
come on, it's just football.
whoo!
coming, tara?
i think i'm staying.
i haven't finished with christian yet.
come on, we're getting out of here.
you know, in this scenario, the toilet's part of the script.
you can hold it.
no, i can't keep it for 00 hours.
i'm starving.
yeah, me too.
i'll go...
i'm gonna go get some food.
this place is closed against the smoking.
find another toilet.
why do men have to smell so bad in the men's room?
why do you have to be so bad?
that's true.
they stink.
what you did was a crime and a hell of a lot.
just think and finish your work before we both die of oxygen deprivation.
can't, can you please hum a song or something?
hurry up.
i still can't figure out why you sent that list to everyone.
you're just as annoying as a whirling fly.
that just made you look bad.
okay, don't say anything.
there you go.
hey, where's tara?
i don't know.
huh.
whoa!
hey, baby.
i've got plenty of room in my lap.
hey!
i wrote this, princess!
come on, we'll catch them later.
you want to die?
didn't you see what they were trying to do to me?
you can't fight around here.
anyway, what are you still doing here?
if you want to know, i was waiting for the bus.
what did you see me in a limo?
you don't know anything about me.
i don't think i want to know.
i've never met anyone as rude as you.
didn't your mother teach you manners?
he's dead.
look, if you're worried, all you have to do is call.
who said i was curious?
just checking my messages.
what do you know?
i can understand anything.
this communications must have started something.
really?
can you see this?
ow.
i can't imagine what it's like to lose your mother.
no, you can't.
was she dancing?
yeah, she was young.
is that why you wanted to go to the academy?
will you leave?
i won't.
i don't believe you.
i saw you dance!
right.
he lives in brenoken hill.
very good.
and say i got in trouble.
i don't know, probably.
you said you were close.
so you're saying he answered, right?
brothers help your brothers?
maybe he will until i call him.
but when she calls another number, she opens it because she doesn't know it was me.
now you know everything.
right or wrong?
i wish i was wrong, but...
see, you've learned nothing.
my brother and i are very close.
i have one question left.
question 00.
ask.
why did you tell everyone i was dressed in the wrong dressing room?
you knew it was an accident.
why would i even bother?
i don't believe you, you're still lying about it.
i know you did.
you know, i wasn't the only guy there.
have you thought about that?
tara, what were you thinking?
do you think...?
do you think it says 0 or 00 here?
two and four hours.
you want to know why i'm bad to tara?
because the three of you are so stupid!
i need to talk to you.
like you don't know.
you've been laughing all this time, haven't you?
excuse me?
at the start of the audition week... you told everyone i was in the wrong locker room.
it was you, wasn't it?
come on, admit it was a funny thing.
and leave me alone on the beach?
isn't this fun?
but you weren't with us.
and not responding to my pros and cons list?
i didn't realize i had to answer.
of course you were.
all school is laughing at me because of you.
why should it be because of me?
look, if you want to hear the truth, i'm ashamed of that list.
i mean, we only talked to you three or four times, right?
and you went and wrote everything you felt and sent this to the whole school.
i don't even know you.
tara?
tara?
she can't talk to you.
yes, she can.
i thought you were sick of the girls coming to you after ethan.
because i hate seeing my friends get hurt.
growing up, mom and dad used to warn me of all danger.
we have to make it all ourselves...
prove to me yesterday's homework wasn't a waste of time.
good job, boys.
whether we like it or not, we're bound by rope that will never break each other over the next year.
so we have a long way ahead of us.
morning.
morning, bette.
uh-huh.
get dressed.
i want to be there when they open.
okay.
i already threw a candy.
one is enough.
here's your napkin.
you want butter?
here you go.
morning.
be careful.
the inspector's here.
morning, mrs. tremont.
morning, mr korman.
mr. tremont.
hi.
yeah.
what can i do for you, miss tremont?
it says here that pork chops are sold.
what you see in the meantime is all in advertising.
how are those pork chops?
we're not selling them.
there's only pig chops in the commercial, mr korman.
no pictures or id numbers.
so what do you want, miss tremont?
i want these ribs out of that price.
all right.
jake.
hey!
jake.
uh... uh... uh
first of all, i'm sorry to have this job on you, john, but we have a staff problem you should know.
we can't decide between goldman and us.
i know you hate it, but you gotta come in here and use your magic wand.
is the guy that good?
let's not miss this guy.
these kids from business school think they're worth $000,000 when they're working a week.
i hate that attitude.
okay, set this up with kathy for the weekend.
i got a note for the next days.
the vale project has given us a lot of directions, but management is resisting our suggestions that we provide information on why investors are so profitable that the firm understands so profitable.
they don't want to give their competition that much information.
i don't know why we have to cooperate with this vale guy.
he's a dark type.
we're putting the company at risk.
if we turn him down, we'll never get a job from him again.
he's demanding a huge fee and the banking branch wants it.
i'm worried about my profits this year.
lower your price.
i think it's the soonest concern that's been recorded on the snowmobile.
yes?
your sister's on the line, mr. tremont.
she says it's important.
he should talk to you right away.
i'm in a meeting.
john, this is about our mother.
he had a heart attack.
she's fine now, but she's serious.
can you come?
hey!
how was your flight?
good one.
the guy next to me didn't leave me alone.
she heard me on wall street, so don't ask.
"how are these stock options?
i understand.
have you heard of a stock called chetix?
mario.
i mean, someone in the math department told me about it.
they produce heat sensors for heat sensors working in low temperature.
it's gonna be bigger than the phone.
no.
no?
no.
good.
at home with your father.
home or the hospital first?
it doesn't matter.
let's go to the hospital.
i thought so.
how's dad?
to be honest, johnny was a little shaken up.
that's why annie's staying with her.
she doesn't want him to be alone.
how's mom?
how serious is she?
he can't really admit he had a heart attack.
she's lying there for a heart attack, and she claims she's indigestion.
she blames me.
what do you mean?
she says it's because of the hot dogs i made for dinner.
he claims i tried to kill him.
did you?
no jury can blame me, john.
i believe you.
if you're here, i'm pretty sick.
look, mom, that's why you're the best.
a lot of people in your case didn't feel guilty.
how are you?
any pain?
i'm alive because of my will.
she'll tell you.
i have the will of a woman half my age.
don't waste yourself.
have you seen your father?
no, i came straight from the airport.
if you see him, don't say anything about a heart attack.
just tell me something's wrong with me.
okay?
mom.
listen to me.
just tell him something was wrong with me.
she'll think i was sleeping because my uterus will be taken.
okay.
if you have to eat outside, go to mcdonald's or wendy's.
somewhere simple.
mom, you shouldn't worry about dad right now.
i think you should think about yourself right now.
you had a heart attack.
i'm not sure i had a heart attack.
it pains me more like it's gas pains.
mom, if she was a gas pipe, they'd give you acid tricks.
they wouldn't have tied you to $00 million worth of machines.
did you see the doctor who took care of me?
because i don't believe he's a real doctor.
he was wearing a tight pants with a big silver belt buckle.
she can't be more than 00.
they're grading everybody from medical school these days.
john!
god, good to see you.
you came and saw your mother first, huh?
yeah.
tell me right, john, how she was looking at you.
like mom.
it was like he was gonna drag his serum bottles out of there.
i mean, it's just gas pains.
i'm sure that's what she told you.
and his will?
like a half-year-old woman.
you look so modern.
where should i put your bags, sir?
oh, just put it there.
thanks a lot.
_
you know the rules.
i'm taking them to your old bedroom.
is the living room still forbidden?
you're kidding.
this looks like the same smithson.
dad's out, huh?
yeah, in the greenhouse.
what's he doing there?
mario said that she was very hard to accept.
he's scared, john.
she's really, really scared.
i'm not sure you understand what's going on.
what do you mean?
she saw him, didn't she?
i didn't mean to drag him there.
i told her she wasn't allowed visitors, and she seems to understand that.
hi, dad.
hello, john.
good to see you.
you look good.
good to see you too.
i'll stay here for a few days.
did you hear what happened to your mother?
how is she?
good.
good.
he asked me to say hello and he said he'll be home soon.
something's wrong with your body, isn't it?
something like that.
your old room doesn't work well, you know.
you should use a second blanket.
okay.
as long as you're here, the most important thing is to make everything go smoothly.
your mother has a calendar and her life is really long routine.
and a sugar.
they cut coupons in the morning, make a shopping list.
this is important.
i wrote you a list of pills.
when did she get this bad?
it's been a year since i saw her.
no, you're wrong.
what are you saying?
i was here for christmas.
annie, i need to know that.
okay, i saw him two years ago.
a lot happens in two years.
why didn't you tell me?
i tried to take him to us, but he wasn't comfortable.
we both work all day.
but there are gardens and greenhouse here.
he knows the environment.
i can only stay here for a few days.
then what?
can't you stay longer?
i have to go to boston.
no way.
we have to bring someone home.
but we have to find the right person.
my father's old, john.
yeah.
come on, dad, let's get crazy, huh?
johnny.
i can't find my pajamas.
i don't know where your mother put them.
here.
why aren't you wearing them, dad?
i'll wear it.
are you okay?
i miss your mom.
she'll take what she needs.
good rest.
she'll be home soon.
good night.
good night.
_
okay.
sleep tight.
i don't eat this much in the morning, johnny.
it was good, though.
thanks, dad.
you do a lot of cooking at home, don't you?
not really.
i've been eating outside since sara and i got divorced.
yeah, she was a nice girl.
still is.
how's billy?
santa cruz is now.
she's a freshman in college.
she came to visit once.
so you saw him more than i saw him.
look at this, johnnie.
it's double coupon day at ralph's.
two cans of tuna fish $0.00.
amazing.
how much money is there in new york?
not $0.00, i bet.
no, i disagree.
no way.
listen, dad, i want to talk to you about mom for a minute.
you have something important to understand.
my mother is sick.
it's not cancer, is it?
no, no, not cancer.
it kills cancer, you know.
your uncle ben had five surgeries.
nothing was done to her.
i'm telling you, if you get cancer, you should collect your bags.
look, this isn't cancer.
a heart attack.
will she be okay?
yeah, he'll be fine.
but he won't work hard like he used to.
he'll have to learn to take it easy, and you have to help him with that.
i always tell him that you work too hard.
johnny, he works hard.
you need to learn a few things you can do at home.
look, my mom made you believe that no one else will look after you but her.
we're gonna try to fix her wrong.
i understand, johnny.
i'll learn how to do all this.
you'll see.
we're gonna make fun of her.
okay, dad, first thing we gotta do, let's see,
" separate the colours from the whites."
so dark matter doesn't mix in white colors.
copy that.
i think that's what your mother would have done.
now we know we're on the right track.
okay, let's start with the coloreds, okay?
they're colored.
colored.
white, color, color.
white.
colored.
colored.
and this?
him?
he's white.
okay, this color.
dad, he must be one of them.
i think we should call your mother.
i'm gonna do a living here.
okay.
what do you think we got?
"e, normal.
i'm trying "normal."
what kind of water should we use?
"cold-cold, cold-hot, warm-hot, warm-eye."
what the hell is this?
hot-hot.
i think she was white.
it'll be ready for thursday.
yeah.
what's the easy way to get to the market from here, dad?
i don't really know these streets, john.
your mother will take us where we need to go.
don't you ever drive?
nothing?
i can't.
a few years ago, my license expired.
didn't you get another driver's license?
well, they asked me to pass an essay test on my age.
have you failed the test?
i disagree.
i was afraid i wouldn't.
what are you saying?
you used a great car.
johnny, a good driver, who knows when to drive well, that's all.
i couldn't remember what you liked, so i got everything from scold.
great.
well...
these are beautiful.
i want to see your mother, johnny.
i don't think this is a good idea right now, dad.
i mean, mom's fine, but they wouldn't want visitors.
i'm her husband.
i need to see him.
that's not true.
excellent.
she made me breakfast this morning.
no, i'm not serious.
i don't know, he's built a box.
yeah.
it's all right.
okay, bye-bye.
okay, dad.
annie's gonna talk to the people at the hospital.
or he thinks they'll let you see him in a day or two.
good.
yeah.
what?
i can do the dishes.
i coded these cards by color.
there's a different code card for daily home affairs.
for example, now, the pink ones are for washing dishes.
go ahead, take a look and see her number run.
number one: number one: number one:
"f fill it with water."
okay.
number two?
"suya put some soaps of soap."
okay.
"shave the dishes in the watery water."
i've prepared these for you to work on your own.
these are great, johnny.
if i follow these cards, there's no reason for me to make a mistake.
i'll watch these.
i'll show you how to burn the stove, dad.
no, on the other hand, the booze is now off limits.
no january.
and stay away from that blender...
no apprentices.
i think i should work with this.
your mother wouldn't want me to wear this.
i look so rude.
like johnny cash.
you don't think so when you wear this, do you?
no, dad, i don't think so.
don't take your guns to town, son.
leave those guns in the house.
bang, bang.
"fill the sink."
it's professionally waxed, dad.
you can see yourself in the ground.
there's no cila yellow scar.
you know what i think?
i think we should reward ourselves.
what do you mean?
let's go out and have a good time.
what do you say?
okay.
okay.
what do you and mom do here for fun?
"i" 00. 00. 00.."
"i" two-zero.
"o" 00. 00. 00. "o 00. 00.
seven-five.
"b" 00. 00. 00. 00. 00. 00. 00.
"b" one-one.
next up, okay?
"g" 00. 00. 00. "g" 00.
"g" five-eight.
are you kidding?
doesn't air condition work here, dad?
or a fan?
"i" 00... 00... 00... 00... 00...
whoo-choo!
i love it when they do that.
do they always do it?
"b" 0 "b" 0. 0 "
and after!
boy, this evening is so much fun.
"i" 00. 00. 00.."
bingo!
bingo!
jake tremont, is that you?
hal mccarthy.
how are you?
remember gloria?
my son, john.
she's visiting from new york.
how do you do?
bette here?
no, in the hospital.
that's good to hear.
pass along our best wishes.
we will.
thanks.
you heard about nick price, right?
he's dead.
oh, yeah.
nick robin, dorothy, the twins.
all of them.
the whole table.
and the delores patcher on the other table.
gone.
he's dead.
well, good to see you again.
it's been a while.
a long time.
nice to meet you.
they're like fresh air.
i know bingos.
haven't you been here a long time, dad?
when was the last time you played here?
it's been three years.
you're kidding.
why did you stop coming?
i don't know.
we used to have so much fun here with your mother more than anyone, but...
we don't do the things we love anymore.
i don't know why.
i think you should remember what you enjoyed and start doing them again.
that's a good idea.
john, i'll write this down.
i'll make a list of things we enjoy.
yes, sir.
bingo.
what?
i think you did bingo.
hey, bingom!
i was worried about you, john.
i'm afraid you'll be addicted.
we should take a look at this.
we can win and win regular gain.
i know a computer boy in new york, let me consult him.
it's super cool with numbers.
it will produce a system for us.
you'll see.
we're gonna beat these guys, dad.
i'm sorry, i didn't want to leave you behind so late.
it's like christmas night.
all that's missing is guy lombardo.
he's dead.
no wonder hal mccarthy didn't mention it.
big day tomorrow.
better get to bed.
good night, john.
good night, dad.
"b" 0 "b" 0. 0 "
and then.
there they are, dad.
hi, dad.
you're kidding me.
ready to see him, dad?
i can't believe dad looks so good.
you think so?
thanks to you, john.
i'm fine because of him.
that was fun.
listen, i hired someone to take care of the house.
it'll be a day or two.
i can stay home till mom gets home.
really?
yeah, no problem.
hey, bette.
are you okay?
uh-huh.
you swallow blood pressure pills?
are you eating?
yeah, i'm fine, bette.
i can make my own bed now.
washing dishes, too.
john's teaching me how to cook.
she's like a real wife.
just keep her alive till i get back.
thanks for the id.
mom looks good, doesn't she?
yeah, great.
i can't go anywhere without my tubes.
i mean the color of your face, mom.
my color?
what are you, a decorator?
don't call me mom.
do i call you son?
don't be so kind to my mother, mario.
you're gonna kill him.
why are you cooking?
there was food in the fridge.
i told you.
we just wanted a little change, that's all.
we had salmon last night.
one night we ate the decoq au vin.
your father doesn't like foreign food.
just the chicken with red wine.
he shouldn't drink red wine.
mom, that was it.
i don't want her to turn into an alcoholic while i'm here.
nobody eats coq au vin is an alcoholic.
calm down, bette.
don't worry about everything.
just focus on getting better here and don't worry about me.
you sure you want to come, dad?
it's gonna be a long meeting.
no, i will.
good for me.
i could buy you a lunch here and watch a movie.
i'll sit down, read a magazine.
i'll be fine.
okay.
i want to see john tremont, vic walton, please.
she's waiting for you.
dad, do you think you'd be comfortable here with all these repairs?
sure, nobody's gonna drop anything on me.
john, good to see you.
sorry about the mess.
good to see you too, vic.
this is my dad, jake tremont.
dad, this is vic walton.
nice to meet you, mr. tremont.
me too.
will we be here in an hour?
like i said.
okay, well, take care, dad.
wait a minute.
we can't leave your father here.
mr. tremont, why don't you come in and sit with us?
i think that-- i think that--
ralph, we've given you all the privileges and now our guess is that our wife is now less than 00% less than yours.
how can you be so confident?
you-you've never followed anything like this before.
and if you're wrong, we're gonna be the laughing mask of the industry and we're never gonna be able to do business with you again.
forget about running the canned factory.
he loses money every minute he's open, but at least 00 million dollars in his property.
how can you be so sure of $00 million?
we can leave it on a little bonus for $00 million.
do you have any backup information?
can i get back into position now?
the real value is 00 million dollars and we have no problem with all the transportation jobs around you.
they can handle all the generals, but the plan we've got is that we have to eliminate 00% of the executive staff in a few months.
isn't it just enough to sell?
that way, the accounting logs will be taken care of.
if this goes well, it won't be necessary.
i don't think they're focusing on this.
we can change that.
and the other thing is food wholesale sales, a fine sector at the villa.
now, our cash flow plans in our department seem evasive, but not satisfactory.
when we consider everything, we have no problem getting a loan from the banks.
yeah, that looks good.
johnny, what's going on in there?
well, we're gonna get a salmon, dad.
i didn't know you had information about something like that.
actually, i don't know.
the man who came to us for money doesn't know.
we're just gonna get the company, and then we're gonna call it off.
is that your job?
you buy companies, then close?
it's a little complicated, dad.
we're buying this canned canned factory.
then the company gets a mess.
this third generation management takes over, and the production is horrible.
but there's a small trailer company, and here's the scrap.
the factory is built on a valuable property near sea.
so we buy the factory, close it down, then we take the money company, then we sell the land.
and you never thought to run these companies?
there's no money in that, dad.
the world has changed, johnny.
you can't believe how the world changed.
remember when you were a little kid, you used to go to work with me and lockeed?
i'd take away their shells and touch them.
they'd give you 00 cents a day, and i'd buy a ham sandwich for that money.
when you grew up, you'd say you wanted to work there, work together.
but what you do now is buy and then shut it down.
you hear anything about those lockeed men, dad?
rick malinson?
tommy williams?
they all moved away.
to the valley, palm springs...
there was nobody there to say goodbye to me.
next morning, there wasn't anybody in the business i did.
the two worlds would split into two groups: two
workers and bosses.
i don't know, dad, i don't think-
it's all right, johnny.
there's nothing wrong here.
i'm a worker, that's all.
but you're different.
you like being in control.
you like taking responsibility.
you're a boss.
mom?
what do you think?
okay, dad.
"if you can hit a parked vehicle and find the owner of the vehicle...
why are you doing this?
i've already passed the written test.
i know, but you might not be too careful.
a lot of these samples could come out on a driving test.
i want to prepare you for this.
very good.
thank you.
we've come this far.
i don't want to see anything go wrong now.
they want us to pull over here.
go.
slow, slow, not so fast.
okay, stop.
there she is.
jake tremont?
actually, it's jake tremont.
i'm his son, john.
i guess you didn't need to know, but you heard.
you can't sit here during the test, sir.
oh, i'm sorry.
oh, you can't stay in the car.
what are you talking about?
this is my father.
that's the rules.
i'm not gonna test as long as you're sitting in the car.
either you leave now, or your father is a failure in the test.
everything all right?
it'll be fine if you take it off.
when you're leaving your car parked parked parked car parked in traffic-
john?
i'm going.
i'll check the bikes and the other vehicles.
yes!
while waiting to make a left turn, give priority to the vehicles from the corridor.
make sure all the dangerous vehicles pass.
yes!
uh, look who's here.
hey, dad.
hey, billy.
hey... hey... hey
my grandmother was sick.
i ran right away.
i thought you might need me, grandpa.
don't even think about helping your grandpa.
when was the last time you had dinner?
why are you americans so obsessed with food?
you know, in rome...
what were you doing in mexico?
semester vacation.
i have some friends there.
dad, you say that every time we see you.
and i haven't grown in two years.
how's your mother?
good.
she's a third year in law school and top of her class.
it's embarrassing if your mom gets more notes than you, but we work.
send my love.
how are you?
sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
if i know you, you win more than you lose.
if you're done, wax it with a piece of cake.
she looks very good.
what's going on?
well, we're spending a lot of time together.
pretty good time, huh?
they say it's good for parents and children.
maybe you and i should spend more time together.
this looks great, grandpa.
too much.
looking good.
i'll give you a name after this, bill.
butter?
want some butter, honey?
i want to raise my glass.
aha.
a lot has happened in the last two weeks.
