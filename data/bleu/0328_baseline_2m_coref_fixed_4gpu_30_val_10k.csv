michael was sharing his bed for the first time in years.
unfortunately, the person he shared his bed was his brother, buster.
buster.
buster.
hey-hey.
i don't think we both fit together.
yeah, i miss my mom.
i'll tell him.
i need to write a trial of at least 000 words pertaining to the morality of war and a firefight.
i'm not sure my ethics teacher would like me to cheat when i write the essay.
then you passed my moral test.
in fact, gorgeorgorgicemichélichéthai bethbaerly's delicate teacher, hopelessly burned.
even small offenders can be brutally cut by the hand.
he doesn't have no ring ring ring
try to remember everything he said about me, okay?
okay.
michael.
i need you to do something about my son.
and you adopted my father?
the d.d.k.' s on us.
your father thought it would make us look better.
he must have faked my signature.
'and i'll have a son who'll finish his skimming cheese a year ago!
you gotta get me out of this.
i'll call social services, but you have to get buster back.
but i can't look at him either.
i don't have a mother's compassion and milk anymore.
hello.
michael.
there are two girls here.
a couple of fun girls... a couple of fun girls... a
come on, michael.
we had a little disagreement.
i'm offering you an olive branch here.
yes, yes.
by the way, when was the last time you slept with someone?
meanwhile, lindsay was doing george michael's homework.
why do i tell you this?
i guess it's because there's some things that a man can't tell his father.
lindsay thought george michael wanted to set up his teacher... so he could fulfill his mother's duty.
there's nothing wrong with that.
however, i must say that i'm a little upset because you don't think about me for that.
aunt hale can do that assignment.
teachers can fill that role.
sure, someday, you'll find the right woman to fulfill this mission.
but until they do, i'll be right across the hall.
lindsay had never been more proud of what she'd said her whole life.
meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to come.
this is shannon, the girl i keep telling you about.
she's really... young girl.
it's your date, nazh... nazh... nazh...
galia.
and here's your date.
"nagarma, you have a mustache.
i mean, there's milk on the mustache.
yeah.
but gob has misunderstood the emotional attention that michael was kindly gracious about... and felt a competition to interfere.
'cause, you know, beyond loving... and exotic.
i find you very attractive.
_
and george sr.' s about to have a surprise visit.
i've read all your teachings and got all your tapes.
and i watched it all over again.
george sr. had recently presented a series of tapes of his suggestions... in order to earn money from the new spiritual outreach to the people he had just discovered.
i also lost two pounds by eating your banana bluth jail bars.
i came to find out where.
this is a nice place to start.
and after michael got rid of two girls he was dating, he met lindsay at parent-teacher night.
hey, linds, is this my imagination... or does this rape room have the same plan as our kitchen?
i think she's really nice to you.
i thought it would get her to get the maternal concept out of her mind.
besides, i can't rush into a job like this just because my son wants to get married to someone.
i'm mrs. baerly, the ethics teacher.
my goal is to make my students understand the importance of the life that could be lost by the impulsiveness of an unthinkable trigger.
and michael got to know his son's ethics teacher.
that's the "rrrrrräd of that situation.
you know, it's frustrating.
i mean, after mr. daniels had a stroke, they gave me this class.
i thought you were kidding.
no, i was just laughing because you were laughing.
irrrrrrrrrrrp.
but, you know, it, it's just, you know,
and i think i'm a moral human being.
yeah.
a moral question to you.
can a parent teacher invite you for a drink?
or... or... or... or... or
yeah, he's dead.
i think it's this mr. daniels' stroke of mr. daniels' stroke... thing i'm guessing about
let's go have a drink.
well, maybe it'll help.
george sr. was working on his own fan.
i've already told you a lot of sin.
maybe you could tell me some of your sins.
well, there are lawyers showing my sins.
but, back to your sins.
tell one of the things about this thing... one of the things that happened at the college dorm again.
and what's going on with the second date with michael today on his date with misserly...?
michael, this little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with it.
at least, i think it's him.
you're gonna have to strip him down to his underpants to say a definite thing.
yes, mom.
they'll get him back.
don't take your shoes off, mister!
don't take your shoes off!
it's out of control.
who is it?
it's " bannongg, mrs. daddy and i were adopted.
what, i'm leaving for a few days and you and a new son?
lucille realized buster was worried, maybe jealous.
and he knew what it felt like to be ignored.
annyong is your brother now your brother your brother now, annong
cancel it.
he's staying.
listen, i'll call you back later.
it was nice driving.
you making dinner reservations?
a blessing went to korea.
and after their dates... and after their meeting.
michael took a step he hadn't taken in years.
well, do you think that's a good idea?
i think that's a great idea.
mm.
that's a great idea.
but how do we sneak in without waking everyone up?
this might not be the best idea i've ever had.
i'm sorry, michael.
i'm sorry too, michael, but it looks like we're even.
you took someone i loved.
i got you one you liked.
"nashbagerlajam. "
listen, i know you're trying to get even with me about marta.
i was lying to you when i said i wasn't going to try to get to her, so... so... so... so... so...
he has to accept it.
i don't think there's a problem with that.
right.
i slept with someone new.
again, i didn't like nazhgalia.
really, lucky for me, i got rid of him.
it's okay.
it's so romantic.
who's "n. bahn-ahden? "
hey, george michael.
i wanted to talk to you about something, but first i need to say i don't know if it's real.
but, now... your moral teacher... is... your next moral teacher... is... but
yeah, i did that for him.
oh.
she loves saddam hussein.
but, you know, for the subject, i'm sure you're interested in him.
i'm sure you don't like saddam.
you know, i wanted to do something special to show him that i care about him.
about his class?
i mean, i mean, he loved her... my loyalty... to him...
hey, george michael.
i'll go home and think about it.
i'll go home and think about it.
dad, what was he doing here?
michael knew he had a moral responsibility to tell his son the truth.
yeah.
your uncle gob slept with her.
well, why did he do that?
why did he sleep with my ethics teacher?
you and i know that, but gob new... the new... the gob... the new... the
he's not one of the good shooters that makes his mark, and he's about to shoot everywhere.
you know, but, listen, did you really think it was...?
i mean, he's old for you, don't you think he's old?
we don't even know how old he is.
nobody knows.
she was chaperoning the strange dance... and i thought maybe i'd go up to her and, uh, make her a joke and, uh... well, you know... well
"essam, would you like to dance, would you like to dance-up-
and that's what i thought you were gonna say, " what the hell, you know? "
i've done it differently in front of the mirror, but... but...
but, you know, we were, uh, dancing with a joke or doing something.
i didn't think it through.
don't you think you should date someone your own age?
like your cousin.
i've analyzed a book that's hard to find a picture of saddam's bath suite.
" what would my brother do? "
yeah.
yeah, you know anything?
okay, that's the same as our fire escape.
in prison, george sr. was preparing for the evening with his most loyal fan.
while cindi lightballoon was making their own preparations.
how are we doing?
we have a video.
and george michael is still angry at gob's... and he's looking for a family expert to create a problem with him.
i know you're dating shannon.
that cheerleader?
yeah, he's probably gonna take her to one of those stupid, stupid, stupid
i wish i could bring someone to surprise everyone.
you know, i actually called mr. daniels and asked him... but he was breathing, and he dropped the phone.
i didn't hear back.
you know, maybe i should go together.
that's right, i mean, it was a bad example... it was a bad influence.
hello.
my mother took him.
he's making me book him into school.
my new little brother.
so we're related.
and michael went to discuss the george michael situation with ms. bearly.
i'm sorry.
hi.
don't worry.
i mean, you're interested in him.
i want to talk to you about that.
but i liked spending time with you.
if you want to talk about morality... if you want to talk about yourself
you see, george michael made you this poster.
you know, he's, like, in love, like, in love, so... so... so... so...
he knows we're out.
i told him you were sleeping with my brother.
this could be the most unnatural thing i've ever heard of in my life.
well, you've only been a ethical teacher for half a semester.
look, it was a preliminary move.
my brother was gonna try to sleep with you.
so, i want to leave you right now, and i'm not going back to you.
i understand.
from now on.
george sr. went for a walk with cindi.
george.
and he's getting to know her.
you can totally spill your inside to me here.
it's weighing on my soul.
you, you... you, you... you
he's pulling the camera.
i'm taking him to the dance, and this is your dinner, so it's off with my mom now.
actually, lucille was taking annyong and maeby somewhere.
you're trying to steal from the wrong guy.
watch your back, my little migrant little brother!
and the spices were in the last tempo.
wow, i'm sorry.
i mean, you're not letting him in because he doesn't have your perfectly shaped nose, an apartment-shaped eye-shaped jaw because he doesn't have a strong square jaw.
you wanna dance?
all right!
gob finally found the shannon he was looking for... who he wanted shannon
gobun found out he was cheating on her with nazhgalia.
shannon, where are you?
shannon shannon!
hey, lisa.
shannon shannon!
excuse me.
listen, i screwed up, okay?
beth!
i ruined our relationship, okay?
i had to see you.
i've been thinking about this for a while, and-and-and... and-and-and
this... is your right thing.
george michael!
uncle gob?
george michael.
what are you doing in a high school dance?
i'm just here with my girlfriend.
yes, with my ethics teacher.
hey, george michael.
you slept with my ethics teacher.
after you've been so horrible to you, you've really been able to protect me.
actually, gob mistook michael's ethical teacher... for a domestic information teacher.
man, he... he understands the type.
gob, mrs. whitehead was a homicidal teacher.
second move.
i was seeing ms. baerly, and i should never have brought gob into this.
but the day you told me you liked him, i didn't know what else to do.
i never meant to hurt you.
i didn't know you two were serious.
well, you know, i'm open to it.
we're open to this.
wow!
no, no, no, no.
just one day, you know.
i'm not good with kids.
the lady said no, man.
listen, michael, i hope you find what you're looking for.
i mean, we laughed at some sad things, but... but... but... uh... we just.
i don't think we're gonna have a future.
and, jeremy, i'm taking that cake.
hey, you wanna dance?
i can't believe this is working.
she's on the next one at the camelopment.
buster's scam gets mad.
stop, stop, stop, stop!
we're not allowed to have candles here.
my mother is going crazy.
no, it's okay.
i light my own candle.
yeah, that's exactly what i'm gonna do.
are you okay?
i'm so sorry.
no, it's okay.
really.
you want me to help you carry these?
it's okay.
right, let me help you out here.
these?
okay, i'll move it for you.
yeah.
come on, boy!
connie.
bob.
what you're suggesting, connie, is something really extreme.
very extreme.
come on!
come on!
okay!
okay!
come on!
come on!
go, go, go, go!
what are you doing?
stay away.
i don't want to die.
we're all going one day, right?
four months ago, each of you attended an interview, to attend a never-before-seen tv show.
and guess what?
you win.
i guess some people came to life for tv, and i'm one of them.
my favorite color is yellow, like the sun.
hey, i'm randall, and i'm a total homosexual and i'm proud of it.
you're a sweetheart, aren't you?
i want to rule our country.
next question.
my name is angel, from england.
me too.
he's my brother, stanton, my probation officer.
hello.
when stanton and i were two, our mother hit him over the head.
he doesn't know.
but i do.

they seem like barack obama these days.
each of you will earn $ 00,000.
this abandoned prison.
wow!
damn!
cool.
how come i never heard of this show?
how do we know this isn't a prank?
right.
this is our third show, but we're not gonna publish it until the fall.
you're gonna have to play and earn the money to see if this donkey joke is a joke or not.
you'll be asked to perform a series of missions.
the duties will challenge your borders, your courage and your imagination.
that sounds fun, doesn't it?
what kind of assignment, man?
make up your mind now.
i'm in.
where do i sign?
i didn't have a girlfriend who would admit it when she was high on her mind.
i need to take care of my little brother.
i'm in.
you're nuts.
do you know the history of this prison?
some of them died there.
like what?
stick around.
you'll find out.
the total will be divided equally between the survivors, but if you all make it through the night, there's a rich prize for you.
no money can make me spend the night here.
anyone else wanna join him?
not me.
there's no way i'm going all the way to the city with this pissed-
i'm in.
get me out of here.
your car's waiting.
untie him.
bye.
you're an idiot.
this is a fucking party joke, and they're gonna fuck all of you.
you're nothing but a bunch of morons.
can't you see this is a party that was taken on the record.
or become famous.
there's a human head!
don't worry, it's not real.
looks pretty real to me.
that's why they're calling our business " special effect on s.u.p.i.p.d.
lovely, isn't it?
it's a small sign of what's waiting for you inside.
thank you for our bounty special effects team.
follow me, fellas.
in the hot swamp water, lazy crocodiles are waiting for their prey.
the indian crocodiles become long and selfish.
such is the gators... such as the gators... such

we're all set.
and totally.
keep it up.
yes, sir.
hi.
it was great that you scared them.
yeah.
i can't believe these kids are going to be in the show.
you really looked like you were scared.
because i was.
i mean, first of all, this place really gives me the creeps.
did you know that?
the dead homeless?
sure.
why didn't you say anything?
it's probably a big coincidence.
you really think it's safe there?
it's safe enough for the show to be insured.
any other questions?
yeah.
how do you sleep at night?
like babies.
let's get this over with.
okay.
we're skating.
each of you were chosen by your own free will, to spend the night in prison to earn $ 00,000.
it's clear enough, isn't it?
all right, let's get this party started.
you can find whatever you need in your main camp, it's the principal's office.
where?
it's complicated.
maybe one of you should write it down.
but you've got all the above us, how can we write?
go down the corridor, right turn, right turn, right again, then left.
go straight to the stairs, to the left, right, and one more left.
would you like me to repeat it?
yeah.
too bad.
you'll find a key there to get rid of your chains.
is anyone in there?
we'll see about that.
i thought going out the basement was terrible.
have fun, prisoners.
good luck.
where's he going?
welcome to the mission.
can you just not do that?
i can't see a damn thing here.
anyone remember where we're going?
go straight, right, then left.
no, straight, twice right, then left.
there was a lot of flat goings.
no, go straight down the hall, down the hall, down the hall, down the
" turn right, do it again, and left.
" rays straight up the stairs, straight up,
"sola, right, and turn left again.
what are you?
smart.
illet will be a great show.

careful.
oh, god.
what is this place?
and get ready.
it was fun.
let's speed them up a little.
okay, my queen.
come on!
now run!
turn left.
why can't i see anything?
shit.
i don't know.
it's running low, the generator should have kicked in by now.
damn it!
hurry!
weird, isn't it?
be careful!
left!
here we are.
we're here.
it's freezing in here.
look, the key.

"elam brave contestants.
" welcome to the bureau of clem harvis.
" there's a box in the middle of the room.
" the chess pieces will determine your personal role.
" you can't trade with other contestants.
" the juggings were his favorites.
" now it's your turn to put your hand in the fuckin' to put it in the box, you
shit.
well, who wants first?
i.
what's going on?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i don't know.
really?
you should have seen your faces.
not cool.
black king.
black rook.
white horse.
white queen.
look.
damn!
that was really fucking crazy.
welcome to the mission, my little pigs.
now let me tell you about pennyville state prison.
in the time of 0000, when the cost went up, the ruthless commissioner decided to raise his fortune by destroying certain expenses.
they were prisoners!
by the time the director was exposed, 00 prisoners were already executed.
last time the death sentence here was commissioner harvis himself.
rumor has it, the director's still walking around the halls.
you will be asked to face the director tonight and face the tortured souls under this building.
first assignment.
white queen.
try not to die!
anybody want to change?
absolutely not!
okay.
" the white queen must go to the prison church to complete her mission.
can you hear me?
yeah, where are you?
i'm still in the first hallway.
that sounds great.
thank you.
damn it!
what?
they turned my flashlight off.
i can't see a thing.
okay, take it easy, randall.
now turn right and go straight.
they hung the babies!
children... children... children... children... children
i guess they rigged it all with a speakerphone.
the voices are more effective than the image to trigger our fears.
is that true?
okay.
god!
that sounds lovely.
no, i'm fine, man.
freak.
did you hear that?
what?
i don't know.
there's a sound.
i think there's someone in the room with me.
they're shouting from speakerphone, randall.
really.
okay.
what the... what the... what the...
nice set.
they want you to turn off the flashlight.
okay, now what?
open the page marked from the bible...
" you will find the lord's prayer.
" before 00 years ago, the sacred place has been disrespectful to this place,
" and now, this is a dense chamber of unusual events.
oh, my... it's the other way around things.
no way.
no, man.
don't do this shit.
i can't do that.
" when you complete tolerance... "
" if a sign from the warden,
" you can go back to your camp. "
deep breath, randall.
do it.
i'm sorry for who i'm bothering.
it wasn't my idea.
okay.
" protect the evil from evil...
" our father... our father in the precincts... "
" do not let the temptation rule us.
" protect the crops from overstepping... "
" forgive those who owe us, forgive us our debts.
" give us this day our daily bread.
" like the one in the darknet...
" like in the mug,
" for thy kingdom and dominion is yours.
please tell me i can go now.
"be before we head for camping.... "
jesus, randall, you have to put out the candle.
you're kidding, right?
sit there for a minute.
look what they're made for money.
where'd he go?
from what i understand, the people who did this job, they cut off our relationship with homo friend for a little while to get a more creepy air into the business.
whatever.
sure, it's gone in the click.
guys?
i think we did something really cool.
guys?
guys?
guys?
did you see anyone?
no.
come on, dude, it's not that bad.
it's definitely not worth the money.
but it was worth the money to complete the mission.
thank god i'm finished.
look, i'm still shaking.
i guess i can't do it again.
they can give you your assignment again.
no kidding.
i swear you don't even know how you feel there.
it's like you're walking into heavy fog, just cold as ice.
it was creepy.
is it me, or is it getting colder in here?
yeah, he's right.
i want to go next.
what do you mean?
" cameras aren't on? "
what do you want me to say?
i'm sorry, but these devices are very complicated.
let's send scelzi down and have her look, you're ten.
scelzi.
yeah.
you need to go down and look at some cameras.
yeah.
gentlemen.
too late.
we need to talk.
i'm busy.
we'll talk or i'll leave or i'll talk or
it's important to me too, taylor.
what do you mean?
i had a little research done.
you're talking about all the local girls you slept with when you said " stuffed away "?
am i right?
big lips, broad hips, taylor.
okay, the prison wasn't just for men?
do women have a division?
and that fucking nutjob is wandering around the women's section, never answering to anyone.
he beat them, raped them, impregnated them, starved them.
some people say they feed their own babies.
what does that mean?
what do i mean?
this real story's gonna keep interest in the show!
anyone could be talking about us.
this story you're making up is nothing compared to the truth.
i think so.
so why don't we use this?
because if we do this, the town will sue us.
okay.
are we done here?
yeah.
really?
what is it?
anyway, i'm gonna get some sleep.
are they working?
yes, they are.
good.
scelzi, what is that?
just a little something to make me take the night off.
you want some?
get your hairy ass back here, okay?
aye, aye, captain.
hello?
you scared the shit out of me.
i've got a great deal.
suit yourself.
we're totally ready to begin.
i can tell you my biggest fear is being buried alive.
where am i going now?
" this will lead you to freedom. "
okay, okay, okay
i'm at the end of freedom place.
what am i doing now?
tell him to go right again.
go ahead and turn right.
damn!
what?
blood.
it's not real blood.
no curse, sherlock.
i like this girl.
please tell me the stairs aren't downstairs, just go upstairs.
i'm sorry.
00 feet?
what am i, a pirate?
as soon as you get down there, you're gonna see a door with a fence on it.
he says... he says... he says... he
damn it!
" welcome to detention unit five, cell number five.
" considering the violence and the madness of violence,
shit.
tell me what i have to do and i'll get out of this hell right now.
no!
thank you.
aren't you tired of complimenting each other?
look at me.
he says, " if a convict and doesn't make it through suicide, he says,
" you will suffer the punishment given to a prisoner at the moment of summation
okay, where's the hole?
under your feet.
this place is literally full of shit.
remember the money.
this is a very difficult mission.
" what you're going to do when you're in a vegggone, is
okay.
hello?
hello?
no offense, but i hope you're not my mission.
connie.
what?
look at this.
what?
oh... it can't... it can
you're fired.
why?
you went behind my back, and you added something to the show that i specifically didn't tell you, and you're asking why you were fired?
this isn't our guy.
where did he go?
who the hell is this?
i don't know.
don't look at me.
look, connie, you have to take that guy out, okay?
it's gonna ruin the show.
damn it!
we're ruined.
so you didn't bring this in there?
no with cuts.
it's obvious.
what's open?
come closer.
i asked you why you had a camera in the control room.
yeah.
the backstage surveillance footage... what they wanted to record... what they wanted to record...
holy shit!
holy shit!
you're right.
genius, isn't it?
it's totally genius.
what are you two talking about?
we're part of the game.
so the company wants to book us, put things in a show, scare us to death on the record?
bingo!
so what do we do now?
we'll continue the show.
as planned.
mission three.
black horse and white horse.
mission four.
black rook and white queen.
i told you you might be reassigned.
that's a lot.
okay, black king and white horse are turning right and going to the gas chamber.
white queen and black horse are going straight, and they're going to prison cuisine.
okay, later.
good luck.
"king and horse take a right after left.
"rook and ride all the way to the end of the hallway,
"and go down the stairs? "
scelzi, come in.
i need to talk to you.
scelzi, are you there?
can you hear me?
come on, open it.
we're in.
" welcome to the gathering room.
there must be a light behind you, turn it on.
" the black one and white horse are entering the gas chamber.
nice set, connie.
he deserved the best there, it was the real place.
it's the only place the law branch cleansed.
beautiful, isn't it?
it's pretty creepy.
oh, god.
what's that smell?
it's a well documented fact... that execution rooms often carry the smell of death itself.
of course the smell isn't actually death.
if a man knows his recent moments of his life, he's on the final radar, his anxiety is caused by the stuff that smells a lot of stink.
in this case, the smell of the human smell we're breathing and the smell of the gas that killed him.
it's time for fun, ladies and gentlemen.
the black king is sitting in the chair.
black person?
that would be me.
wait for further instructions.
" you'll find some meat and a pan.
" you will cook and eat meat
my man!
the prisoners always eat the cows the cow, the pig... the pig... the pigs.
" since it's not a lamb and another meat... "
" they suspected it.
" they thought it was a nice meat they'd never had before.
you mean human flesh, don't you?
are you inside?
yeah.
guess what you do now?
i give up.
you'll tie toni.
i'm passing to you from here, toni should fully comprehend the fear of the previous prisoners before they were given gas.
you're good at this.
let's just say some of my girlfriends have some weird wishes.
are you okay?
okay.
" the mission's assignment to the gas team friend... "
" to find the main valve and cut the gas before it's inseminable
you need to watch the pipes.
makes sense.
you bet?
$ 000 to throw up.
okay.
weird.
i can't do that.
i can't.
this is my worst nightmare.
come on, honey, it's just a show.
no fancy jokes.
remember what you said?
"if the team wins, they're going to pay for the extra money. "
do it for the team, girl.
are you gonna puke?
thank you.
okay, angel, i'm at the bottom of the stairs.
damn!

he's back.
it really stinks.

how's it going?
we need to talk to you.
outside?
yeah.
big news.
i think the company is playing us.
what?
who's there?
who are you?
show me the gas chamber.
and what do we do with the clave?
where are they?
i don't know, give me a few seconds.
there.
that guy again, see?
wow!
who's that?
okay, how did he get here so fast?
isn't that the guy in the picture?
yeah.
yeah, she looks like him.
nice.
no, not cool.
this guy either goes through walls, or there's more than one guy.
we've all seen "prestijsbds round, haven't we?
do you mind if we pass?
please?
guys?
guys?
fake blood, fake event.
they did beautifully.
maybe even get an oscar.
no.
no, that's not true.
it's completely out of scenario.
sounds real to me.
connie, they're playing us.
trust me.
what?
look.
they copied the picture.
what?
acting.
clothes.
easy.
wait.
no.
no.
he's a real ghost.
i can't turn it anymore.
if it's any further, he'll be out of my sight.
what?
this is a huge prison.
i can't put cameras everywhere.
show me the hole.
show me the gas chamber.
taylor, someone has to go over there and see if they're okay.
i can tell they don't look good.
she's acting.
where is scelzi then?
i don't know.
he's probably hiding somewhere.
i'll call the office.
okay, you too.
good night.
they don't know what's going on.
i feel like i'm getting worse.
okay, i'll go and prove it to you.
it's okay.
anyone?
i'm coming.
i'll get my camera, maybe catch some nice footage.
thank you.
you have to be nice to them.
you're gonna be fine!
you're gonna get it fixed.
you know what?
you really are photogenic.
you're so funny, kid.
i want to do my duty now.
shut the fuck up.
come on.
connie, what do you want to do?
stop the game.
wow, this place is like a ghost, isn't it?
it gets a little weird.
where did he go?
i don't know.
i didn't see him.
he went this way.
this is a dead end.
what was that?
yeah, what was that?
shit.
taylor?
put angel on screen.
we have to get them out of there.
can you hear me?
listen to me.
there's been some changes to the plan.
we have to stop the show.
what?
why?
i'll be honest with you.
there's another person with you.
who?
we're not sure.
i want you to leave as soon as possible, okay?
you play games with me?
you're trying to scare me.
open the door.
i want to win and take my money.
open this door!
who opened the door?
sorry, you're not serious, are you?
idiot!
your mission is to memorize and locate the seven cell seven.
lucky!
in this cell, warden harvis was wounded deadly by a prisoner.
you're gonna find a key in that cell, this key, in the hole, and it's gonna release your friend in the gas chamber.
great.
was that all?
it was the easiest money i ever made in my life.
what am i afraid of?
nothing.
angel!
stanton?
help!
well, now it's out of my sight.
hello?
who's there?
hello?
angel?
angel.

it's not real.
put me down.
wait.
it's you.

angel, are you okay?
he killed my brother.
he's going to kill me, too.
he killed my brother.
new jersey school acting school.
not bad for someone like me, is it?
connie, are you there?
yeah.
how could you organize this?
we had a hard time.
it's gonna be a great show.
i'll see you later.
why don't i get the shit out of him first?
you're an asshole.
you said you wanted a great show, didn't you?
you got what you wanted.
yeah.

agent 0, report.
i repeat, cia lia liaison officer down.
agent 0, do you see qasim?
command, i heard a vehicle.
they shut everything down.
it's over.
the bbc can confirm that the american terrorist leader adem qasim has escaped from mi0 custody in one of the most serious mistakes in the history of the organization.
apparently, the security convoy transporting qasim was attacked inside a raf northolt route home.
you say it's not a war, because it's on the west side.
because in new york, in washington, in london, you didn't want that.
but pakistan's kids didn't want it either.
when they get hit by drone planes, they call it murder.
qasim offers a new kind of threat.
he hasn't targeted civilians yet.
our models show us the possibility of an attack within 00 hours.
the more pressure he's under, the smaller the window.
i can't say that when i'm on tape... when i'm on tape
the secretary of state is coming tomorrow.
we serve the british people, not washington.
if that's no longer true, we're already finished.
the americans think we're no longer serving the purpose.
we need a bald one.
i'll be relieved of duty in the morning.
have you heard anything about qasim's escape?
i don't think so.
harry, what happens to me if you go out?
you take it off.
nobody else knows you're in qasim's network.
just go.
will holloway?
go.
how's life after mi0?
you're not from the moscow branch.
you need london.
is there anyone you should say goodbye to?
thank you.
we know about harry's connection to your family, so we understand it might not be easy for you.
even if he's dead, it's okay.
harry's too arrogant to kill himself.
he was just pretending to kill himself.
he went to this woman's grave.
the love of your life.
harry's team has noticed changes in his behavior since she died.
he's emotionally distant, cold, drinking heavily.
it'd be underwater 0 degrees.
he'd have been hypothermic before he got to the bank.
this is the picture before we entered this square, which is the picture you said you were taken after the jump.
before he disappeared, harry made three encrypted phone calls.
your old e-mail messagebox.
why did he call you?
i have no idea.
i talked to him the last time he had me pulled out of the mi0 office five years ago.
he wants to talk right now, but.
which makes you useful.
can you help us find him?
no, thank you.
and you, harry, do you talk a lot about berlin?
the night your father died?
if there's something else, mace, i have a right to know.
i don't think that i can decide on that... that's what i don't think
if you weren't really going to kill him, you told me what you wanted to say.
find harry, so you can ask him about berlin yourself.
who are you?
i thought i was gonna take that title to the grave.
recently, the president of the anti-terrorist for her majesty's security service.
funny, but who are you really?
someone who knows what these two words mean to you.
asma shishani.
go.
how did you find me?
what do you want?
i know it was someone on my side.
they never told me who they were.
of course they didn't, but you must have a contact.
it's a phone number, that's all.
the phone number will work.
in return, i'll give you what you want.
impossible.
he said he was a human rights lawyer.
your government helped them after i put two of my brothers in jail.
but after i was released, she became too curious.
i don't know this woman.
if he's an agent, he's not one of us.
and then don't get any trouble, just say again that it's not worth anything to you.
you keep her alive, she's the guarantee that i'll keep my word.
i don't need guarantees.
get him to a hospital, or the deal's off!
what he needs, mercy.
no!
she has a daughter.
and you sent him after me?
you put him in danger and now you refuse to save him from pain?
how the fuck are you?
don't send the family video.
harry... harry... harry... harry...
you have a deal.
according to the bbc, there is no breakthrough in the fact that escaped terrorist adem qasim is caught.
the national threat level is critical, so there's an attack on the handi tower.
in the economy, the ftse 000 fell again this morning and sterling continued to slide, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your, your dough, and the rest of their money
there's a new intel on harry.
he picked up a resonant line we drove all the way to kent coast.
holloway, this is classified information.
we also found traces of explosives.
you've known him longer than any of us.
do you think it's possible that qasim somehow got harry into it?
pulling him with you?
i don't know.
anyway, you find harry, we find qasim.
anything for holloway?
here.
tomorrow, 00 : 00.
salpa 0, kne a, park in five.
then, keep your eyes open.
i hope you come alone.
just for protection.
if you can't bring a crazy cold war geezer down without shooting him, we're in serious trouble.
i promise.
it says not yet.
we're playing it through harry's.
copy that.
doors opening.
go.
floor floor.
doors opening.
open sight, multiple exits.
repeat, holloway.
things harry needs to set up a meeting.
yes, mr holloway, your uncle said he'd meet you at the coffee shop.
he left his cell at home.
the guy in the parking lot, get rid of him.
he'd be wearing an mi0 t-shirt.
listen to me.
stop underestimating harry.
don't think he won't put your men in danger.
wait for him to send a signal... wait for him to...
what is it, alpha one?
holloway?
holloway, where are you going?
wait.
no, we don't have a pattern there.
don't move.
holloway, don't move!
terminal 0b.
doors closing.
he set me up a flight.
pa000 is the glasgow plane.
i'm going to dallas.
call the dallas office.
get me the airport police.
priority code sigma nine.
the police want a clear path to the terminal.
and arrange the permits for heathrow security.
they're passengers for the flight of glasgow flight, pa000, pa000, the
holloway, don't get in the air.
what am i doing here, harry?
i had to find someone i could trust outside the service.
when you're drunk and crazy and dead, that's a short list.
to be honest, the only person i can call a friend is someone who thinks i ruined his life.
qasim's escape was set up by someone at the top of the service.
by one of the people who want you to follow me.
that's why i had to get lost.
you had qasim.
he's our only connection to the traitor.
when he's in the system, he'll be silenced.
he's planning an attack.
someone's trying to destroy the service itself.
you're nuts.
ruth's death... ruth's death... ruth's
don't!
look for yourself, that's all i want.
what are you waiting for, harry?
mi0 was my everything, and you took it from me, for nothing.
hate me all you want, but i think you believe in the service.
what happened in berlin?
is that how they tricked you?
this may not end as you hoped.
i'm afraid i need to tell them there's something in the lining of your coat.
there's nothing there, but they'll have to check it out.
i'll send you a number.
call me in 00 hours, please.
i'm security services.
hands behind your back!
you just let him go.
calm down, francis.
we don't want you having a heart attack.
the deadly one.
mi0 looks like a complete liability right now, and i'm the last friend in the government.
so you need to be really nice to me right now.
in other words, he's nuts?
that doesn't contradict his last three psych evaluations.
he refused to attend.
he didn't stop being harry pearce.
even if he's crazy, i'll still catch him... even though he's crazy.
like.
he wanted me to help him disappear.
didn't you think to accept your request and bring it to us?
just because your life hasn't been worth shit since harry's kicked you out of work doesn't mean we can't put your life in a shitty position right now.
since we've threatened each other, all three of you don't get caught in the blood you don't wave on the cliff.
your entire organization seems to be disabled right now.
find qasim.
it's fully loaded.
they're ready, brother.
qasim's escape.
what really happened?
who are you?
i saw that name in a case study.
i thought they were taking you off duty.
they did.
now, what really happened?
the abduction may have been set up by someone in the service.
do you know anything about this?
what are you looking for?
i left it two weeks ago.
there must be one around here.
tell me, why did you apply?
i didn't apply.
when i was 00, i was hanging out with a guy who did the cash transfers.
k section was interested in some people using this, so they got to me.
you started as an agent?
and when i was done, they wanted me to train as an officer.
my family came back to me when i told you.
and if someone you work for helped qasim escape, that would be a problem, wouldn't it?
all right.
something made me feel wrong that day.
vass, my team leader, he was in the front car with me.
he told me not to open the weapons compartment.
he ordered me not to chase.
where does he live?
it's loaded.
w00.
panama city.
it's a bribe fund.
june, what are you... what are... what are you... here
who are you?
you told me not to chase qasim.
you told me not to chase you when i did my gun.
we swore an oath, rob.
i'm not saying anything until i get to thames house.
we're not going to thames house.
will, what did you find?
qasim's guards have been deliberately weakened.
the team leader was in on it.
he's just a footman.
find out who gave the order.
the americans think mi0 is the weak link and i think someone on the inside is joining them.
when qasim ran away, we fell out of sight.
the cia is totally in his hands.
... fire... fire... fire... fire
he was going to shoot.
the pulse... pulse... pulse pul
dead, dead.
he's dead.
listen.
you should go home.
june!
i'll handle this, but you have to go, now.
i didn't hear that part of a song like that was murdered.
who's the warren viper hit?
landon miller.
the agency witness.
he's trying to ensure his continued support, and he expects not to give up the keys to the kingdom, of course.
every time i see you, francis, you seem to be buried another inch or two deeper in the secret places of a creep from langley or the pentagon.
you don't have to tell me.
in times like these, we mustn't forget who's flag shaking.
francis.
i'm trying to help him, but he's officially accusing me of doing some extra work for the cia.
tonight, your generals, politicians, your spies met for a celebration.
tonight, we will strike at the heart of their power.
our enemy is politicians who send your sons and daughters to die in illegal wars.
you are the criminals who spy against you as you are guilty.
this war is beyond religious differences.
all flights out of the united kingdom... all flights out of the united states
you had it.
warren lived.
if you have a way to get to qasim, say it now.
there's another way.
qasim's wife.
asma shishani.
she has the fsb.
if i find out where they're holding her, she'll give up the traitor.
you made a deal with him.
yeah.
and if we can, he'll lead us right to him.
surrender and arrange.
how do you know she has the russians?
in exchange for a cia agent stuck in moscow.
i can reach far, but you have to open the secret door.
this is an ip address.
you're kidding.
it's the only way, will.
harry's getting help from somewhere.
i've got your old contacts, but i need access to personnel files to do it properly.
but it wouldn't take you anywhere exciting.
in place.
looks like i'm gonna have to play some extra band width.
the first one.
malcolm?
all right, i'm in.
i'm looking at the servers now.
harry, we gotta go.
can we do this any faster?
i can do it.
but unfortunately, this machine is a previous century.
g branch already pulled these.
erin watts.
might be worth a closer look.
fill in the blanks for me.
but i'm a spy.
i almost got him out.
i've been in business for less than a year.
sooner or later they're making you choose.
all right, i'll leave you to it.
are we done?
why am i sure?
i'm sorry, will.
harry.
harry!
harry, what have you done?
stay away from the computer.
i never felt compelled to say this before, but i hope you know what you're doing.
harry works with qasim?
he stole an entire gchq data archives.
everything we have on our west agent friends in russia.
why is harry going to berlin?
they showed up at schnpfeld airport cctv.
i don't know.
harry cyber didn't attack alone.
then who's helping him?
except you.
and you're still protecting him.
why?
i'm not.
let me go to berlin and i'll find him.
and there's a threat.
analysis indicates a large-scale scale attack within 00 hours, multiple targets.
an officer in charge of qasim's escape is missing.
there are signs of a struggle in his house.
do you know anything about this?
how's your mother, holloway?
i heard it wasn't very good.
your father hasn't picked up since he died.
understandable, really.
and then that door works.
i know, i know.
harry was right about something.
you're not good enough.
home secretary, can we really hope for the qasim to stop attacking again?
we've destroyed the threats of our freedom and the way we lived our entire lives.
your ability to wound us may be important, but it's the end.
you'll find that our decision has no limits.
they're not listening.
they never killed our women?
we're making the world a better place, brother.
transplant team is in position at the airport.
we have a clearance by the atc to shut down the road if necessary.
i think i owe you one.
you were right about vass.
danke.
alexanderplatz.
it's on the northeast corner by the metron, 00 : 00.
we have a safe house.
call it nostalgia.
don't forget to bring the archives.
don't forget to bring your wife.
how did you find me?
there's only one place to meet in berlin.
you told me.
northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
no sentimentality.
that's the price of qasim's wife.
when she's out of fsb custody, qasim will give me a number.
he'll take me to the traitor.
they'll be able to destroy it where it's vulnerable to take it.
get in the car, harry.
there's an old hotel 00 minutes away.
my contact can meet us there with two clean passports for us.
you're going home.
sorry about that.
why are you here, miss keaton?
keep moving, harry.
i killed someone because of you.
you're c0s, right?
what are you doing, harry?
talent talent discovery.
so which one of you found it?
jesus, will.
preparation is everything.
and vass?
when he came to my house, i called it in.
i said someone was asking about qasim's escape.
they put me through command, and they told me what to do.
they went to vass's house ahead of us and planted the evidence.
i've arranged for vass to escape.
you think i want to do it?
i know my duty.
i'm the only one here who knows.
you were set up.
he's right, will.
but i wonder if miss keaton is sure about me.
it was a secure command chain.
what was i supposed to do?
do you believe him?
yeah.
i'm sure your men will come and find you, if you're still useful.
after all this is over, what did you think they'd do to you?
i did what they asked me to do.
we're changing the deal.
we're taking qasim's wife to london.
tell him to come on the trade or he'll never see his wife again.
let's go get her.
what happened to alexanderplatz?
sudden agoraphobia feeling.
i'm afraid there was a problem with qasim's wife.
well, at least you're good enough to put it in my car.
harry.
colonel.
i hate to be unkind, but we're gonna need your clothes.
when you're concentrating the calls for adem qasim, all passengers travelling on the united kingdom's national rail line will have to show you a valid id and have to take control of the suitcase.
i have your wife.
let me talk to him.
the russians put him to sleep... and... and the russians
bullshit.
i'm bringing your wife to london.
no.
i'll tell your bitch you said good-bye.
is the baby thing too much?
no, it's you.
i trusted june.
you were right to relieve me of duty.
despite everything i've done, you're still trying to do something good here.
i won't let their sacrifice be in vain.
it was here.
was it quick?
he could have left me, but he chose not to.
if you try anything, anything, i can't guarantee anyone's safety.
nobody.
you bring my wife, i'll give you your phone number.
here we go.
hello?
holloway.
this message came from the h branch.
i.
we can get qasim, but i need help.
and let's report.
one clean choice, hannah.
trust me, and help me.
or go.
or do well, eh?
shit.
they're closing in on the subject.
the self-replicating algorithm i wrote last night is constantly updating itself, reviewing all potential points of view.
won't stop the sudoku?
please.
all right, we're here.
how much time do we have?
i'm looking at 000 cameras.
give me something.
the minute he realizes we're playing him, he's gone.
wait.
he was working 00 seconds ago.
are you sure?
yes, confirmed.
the camera was disabled at the last minute.
third floor roof, east corner.
harry, we have to stall.
i have to hope she's looking at us exactly.
yeah?
he's tried the south.
i have his wife.
you were supposed to look south.
give me the number.
give me the number or we'll leave.
turn around now or you're dead.
here.
that too.
i haven't got him yet.
you have five seconds to turn around.
turn around.
maybe this man has never seen her before.
i'm almost there.
him?
kill him.
give me the number.
don't!
stop!
no!
okay?
will, she's fine.
the shooter's dead.
then it's over.
malcolm, the feather.
yeah?
my wife is dead, isn't she?
harry, listen.
let hannah let us know.
harry?
hannah, why would harry take off the headphones?
i don't know.
let us know.
get sco00 here now.
four vans full of rdx, leaving porthouse north industrial park in the next 00 minutes.
how do you know?
qasim just told me.
trucks are leaving in 00 minutes.
i think we got him.
let's go!
armed police!
stay where you are!
clear!
clear!
anyone seen the primary target?
negative!
negative!
negative, sir.
command, area clear.
harry.
he sold his own men.
why would he do that?
what did you do?
armed police!
don't move!
go!
you have to tell them everything, harry.
i think we have a lot to talk about.
this might be a bit over his head.
since the southwest corner of alexanderplatz.
keep an eye on holloway.
make sure he's safe.
maybe we shouldn't be so hasty.
did you find qasim?
harry will talk.
you still don't know him.
qasim gave up his entire operation.
what did you say to him?
i should have thought they'd let you go after berlin.
they want to offer you a deal.
put everything on harry and go.
i told them i'd quit after i did this.
there's no way out.
i can't.
there's an emergency spare key wrapped around his neck.
whatever you're after... what you're after... what
what would ruth think?
what did you give him?
check the back.
southwest corner.
i found harry on the northeast corner of alexanderplatz.
the opposite.
that's where you're going to trap someone.
harry?
i gave him you.
get down!
get down!
get down!
lock us up.
get down!
get down!
we're not here for you!
we're here for them.
get down!
think of your families.
hamza.
why?
there are 00 men on the other side of these doors.
you must surrender.
come here.
open it!
if you think we're negotiating... if you think we're going to negotiate
open the door.
but he'll kill us.
there's too many demons in one room.
the only way to get out of here alive is to turn surrender... be the only
you think i want out?
how many people's lives began in this room?
my people's lives.
your people?
he did not ask you to speak for them, to kill for them.
if you want a hostage... if you want a hostage hostage
i think he's made it clear he's not interested in hostages.
i'm the director general manager of mi0.
kill me and put your gun down.
otherwise, you're nothing but a dead terrorist.
no one will see you as a hero.
when we're done, you're gonna be a drunk, beaten his wife, a mightless skull.
a couple of marrakech boys drive the prostitute and give them free tickets for free disneyland in return for saying you begged them to piss on you.
we can't remember you very well, can we, adem?
wait, wait, wait.
i got the helicopter back.
but... but... but... but...
you fucking coward.
i thought you were fighting a higher standard.
i'm sorry about your wife's death, adam.
i know what that can do to you.
is this supposed to stop me?
it's okay.
stop!
why did you bring him here?
i made a choice.
without plan b.
why do you think i kept you out of the room?
people are still dead, harry.
so much less than the ones in the blast.
what kind of choice would you make?
this is my job.
auntie, can you come outside to play?
hello, geraldine.
in the end, it comes down to who tells the longest lie.
right?
if we had protected that morning, qasim would never have escaped.
you gave the met's air unit an order to reverse all mi0 requests, didn't you?
that's the advantage of being a lonely maniac.
i don't have to prove it.
sacrificing your own service so it could be absorbed by a foreign power.
the americans would have made you director general, no doubt.
how many more lives was that promotion worth?
what was it that you thought you accomplished, harry?
the service is dying.
but the minute i realized i was on the losing side, my career would be too short.
blow my head off and find my 00-year-old nephew... my 00-year-old niece.
i think this is from you.
what is this?
his intestine is crazy for over two hours, or it leads to unstoppable blood.
he's not leaving a trace.
how clever.
i was afraid that that would be your answer.
so i took the chance to choose.
it's not your stomach snack.
i ate cattle ribs too.
say you're lying, harry.
please.
tell me you didn't betray your country.
it's been 0 hours already, geraldine.
you can spend the last 0 hours in a hospital bed, but if i were you, i'd play with your beautiful niece.
i'm thinking.
your message said you had something to tell me.
they're spying on ruth's grave.
you can't leave now.
i, actually, you have something to be.
your father was wearing it the night he died.
the stasi stripped everything that would work so he found a way to get into the body and the fsb archive somewhere.
he was wearing a wedding ring on the night of his operation?
i didn't appoint you because you weren't good enough.
after your father, i couldn't... couldn't do it...
i should have protected you.
good ones don't last forever, will.
then who is?
they're like me.
if you know your problem and tell the men at the door, it'll help a lot.
there's room for every guest in hotel middle school.
pack in one row.
these new problems kill themselves in the darkness.
these people will be grateful to you when you get dark.
i think we should keep them here to keep them safe, but i'm worried things are going to get worse.
they have no idea who caused the dark problem.
besides, it's not what's hiding in the dark we need to worry about.
we still haven't figured out how to lift this fog wall.
maybe this is a blessing.
this was the latest from in-flight safety.
i'm on your side, and i might need a new job.
i'm under control, but i'd appreciate it if i could get another pillow for my beauty sleep.
try to fix things.
we talked about this.
it's almost impossible to eradicate a troubled person without killing him.
sure, i just need tools i don't have, tools that are impossible to get, materials and perhaps information that doesn't exist.
i'm gonna need a team.
any idea what's going on?
but there's a bad element.
it's the only way to protect the rest of us.
and it's risky driving a car because of the magnet problem.
an engineer to help fix the power plant.
he volunteered as soon as he knew about it.
if things don't work out, you can use his problem for the operator.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
the killer that would leave no trace is out there.
and i think he really wants to prove to you that he wants to help.
well, whatever the reason, just keep an eye on him for me, okay?
because we're both not immune to new problems.
i'm not just saying because it's my mother.
when you're gone, i'll call the person who caused the dark problem.
he stole those batteries and put us in danger.
there was no other choice, dwight.
this is third case in two weeks.
now the serial killer is in this building.
all right, i'm gonna go talk to dwight.
my dad always said you were a good man.
mara's father?
there might be a way, but if you want me to explain it, it might seem more frightening, so don't ask.
even on the map, maine, i can't find haven.
you're telling me you can't find a town with 00,000 people?
that didn't cause problems.
then why didn't we use aether in the first place to finish things?
i can't bring it with the drinks sealed.
so how do we find it?
gloria brought a box of stuff that duke left over in gull.
i don't think william has the amount of aether i need, and, uh, aether is just the first phase.
you told his wife you'd find him.
it's easy for him to decide on the sidelines, but sometimes things just don't
i have a town to protect.
no wonder the plant's working at 00 percent.
guys, i'll try, but remember, i've never done anything like this before.
they parked the car here so i could talk to you, but i can't even pay for the oil change.
if all goes well, i'll be back with aether before sun sets.
this is peggy's husband, rolf.
there's enough panic and fear.
the same killer that killed my son 00 years ago?
we're calling it " the murderer who won't leave any trace. "
what else are you hiding from me, vince?
dwight is doing his best to get the rules, but he's not the type to kill people.
in this haven, exile is the same as execution.
thanks to our friend there, we're holding them in some kind of prison.
he says the generator works at 00 percent.
damn, the generator overloaded their power reserves when it overloaded overload.
well, that explains why the power grid was given to this town.
at this rate, five minutes.
it's almost over, and it's the only thing that keeps us from dying in the dark.
here, i redirect the generator settings to get power to the town faster, but there's nothing more we can do.
they better get back.
help each other.
spread the lamps around.
share your supplies.
you see, i'm happy here.
i got your message.
get in the car now.
come on, jump!
if there's a war ahead of us, we should be thankful, not even slean.
i don't think there's anything worse than falling in love.
i don't like it here.
every story has two sides.
whoever's behind this is a traitor.
let's go.
he asked me to represent him at slean's wedding.
court, you are my brother's love.
that's why you're my brother.
you must have seen much bigger places in the iraqi realms.
none of them were led by a woman.
you must choose a second to accompany you and watch your interests during the ritual.
then you'll listen to the bonds of your friends and relatives.
i don't have any relatives here.
my mother and the others will accompany you.
kela, this is palace from bregan.
rheda, does he always have to be guarding me?
i don't really understand it.
but i know i have to marry slean.
i'll love him.
this marriage cannot happen.
abrecan's trust in you.
what do you do?
carpenter.
then they can use you on the wall.
who are you?
a friend of the council chair.
like i said, i have work to attend to.
we need to figure out how to handle it.
varr said i couldn't accept a present.
then he'll stay between us.
every bride should smell good when it's time for the wedding.
remember, that's our secret.
sit down.
we'll get what we're gonna get when they're looking at the wounded.
you wanted to talk?
all right.
kela, it's time for your ritual.
elvina, will you be the second person next to me?
for the game.
we need to talk sometime.
we need to discuss the reasons that marriage doesn't work out.
if we don't fulfill our mission, their marriage may be cancelled.
beowulf!
let's celebrate.
old tradition!
the dress absorbs the smell.
i'm so sorry.
it was just a little mistake.
that's all.
we're gonna help slean get the symbol for his bride.
that sounds easy.
break!
open the door!
come on, you smelly muddled mudborn born.
come on!
come on!
give me your arm.
come on!
slean.
quiet, kela's sleeping.
are they ready for this marriage?
i don't understand why slean wouldn't want to marry kela.
i don't think so.
put your feelings aside and do what's best for everyone.
would you put aside what you wanted for others?
that's all we have to do.
if someone spends their whole life satisfying others, that person doesn't actually live.
thinking like that must make you feel pretty free.
try it.
tell every rock the truth.
then you can look at each other and light the fire which symbolizes your marriage.
then you'll be husband and wife.
have you ever loved anyone before?
no.
before you come here... you before you come here... before you come
you want to be a thane?
tell my uncle i'm done with him.
yeah.
come on!
go away!
you let him go.
we're not done here.
don't you understand?
i betrayed my mother and plotted with my uncle.
this woman was sent here to kill you!
i don't know.
was it?
i killed my brother.
he's the one who should have been there today.
even if the world was destroyed, mara had everything.
people loved him because he was kind.
my father loved him as his first child.
he and rowan were lovers.
i had a chance to get out of there.
i wouldn't need anything.
he died of a fever, but he.
he was getting better.
i poisoned her.
slean, i'm not gonna tell anyone what you did here today and what happened.
or stay.
i know, but he's beowulf's.
she went to bed last night.
but we can choose who we can draw our destiny with.
light the fire with me.
you want to be a thane?
i can help you.
against whoever's seen you.
they can't take it away from you now, rheda.
with this marriage, you're the shieldlands jarl.
these rules of jarl must be followed by every tribe.
if the blood money is not paid, the life of a murderer will be terminated.
the thieves will be branded and expelled from society.
the price of all the goods in shieldlands will be identified by jarl.
what right does he have to set the price of fish?
we're the ones who risk their lives to catch pandiri every summer, but.
you should have told me about these rules.
you were where your people needed you most, on watch.
i couldn't distract you.
it was messy enough anyway.
you're late for the pandiri.
some think he's missing him again.
but if you fail, bregan will be in misery and open the winter.
breca's wanted for murder, you know that.
kill him!
kill breca now!
i got this!
if you do that without an explanation, we're all dead.
after he escaped the gallows, he hired us to deliver breca to his blood.
should we ask the guy who helped him escape the first time?
so we'll welcome that.
but we have to keep breca.
heorot may be standing at our gates as we speak!
when did we murder young women?
what do you mean?
you've been hiding in the shadows too long, abrecan.
don't forget who you're talking to.
talk.
he wants breca's life or blood money for the murder of his brother.
i didn't mean to kill anyone.
hurry!
thank you.
breca loved my mother.
he's looking for widows he thinks he's got money, then he's stealing the money and he's running, that son of a bitch.
he left my mother and took everything of value with him.
my brother went after him too.
but it cost him his life.
breca, is that true?
i'll pay for your brother's blood money.
lila, do you have 00 silver coins?
i don't want money, i want blood!
silence!
if the blood money is paid, breca will be released.
you lied to me.
pandiri.
pandiri!
put him through right now.
ready, here they come.
i saw it.
get out!
the council has assembled.
he wants to take my place when i've lost the pandiri.
you let me down, she married sleepan keela, rheda became jarl!
you don't understand.
tell the council our enemies are gathered, that your sister cannot rule, that you want to save shields.
so tell me you're distracted.
say it.
i'm sorry.
i knew breca killed someone, but the story she told me was different.
it's only his fault.
lila, no one's gonna think bad things about you anymore... about you.
that's all i've got.
did you bring it?
there are no 00 silver spots here.
it's not enough.
and i'm gonna hold breca while she's doing her job.
was there enough money?
lila?
turn it off, beowulf, please.
you're not talking to lila.
get on your horse, leave heorot and never come back.
there's no place for you here.
if heorot is going to be attacked, i want to fight properly.
if heroot's attacked, i'll cover you.
let's try.
this isn't about mudborn.
i don't want to talk about him.
i want to know why you lied about training me.
it's wasted on you.
you don't even want to get involved.
really?
i didn't know we were training blacksmiths!
go.
now!
he's fighting girls now?
the view was more like the blacksmith was training huskarahl.
i know you think i let you down.
that i can't focus on my duties in bregan.
but i have my reasons.
you're talking about betraying one of your own blood.
we need a warrior in this land!
someone to take his people out of the darkness.
a man with power to control!
you're talking about betraying your sister to cover the fact that you can't provide for your people's needs.
what's the point of having fish if we're all going to be slaughtered?
i'm here to give our thane a vote of insecurity.
those who oppose abrecan to be thane.
it's decided.
a new thane will be appointed and announced in the morning.
get up.
next.
nobody.
don't think this is a game!
we got lazy, distracted.
this is gonna work out here.
from now on, we'll work like dad hrothgar.
i didn't want to interrupt.
you're a good teacher.
a great thane wants a strong army behind him.
we don't have to share the same bed, but if we don't share the same room, people will start talking.
i always liked watching heorot from here.
it seems so invincible.
if i tell my mother the truth, i'll lose her trust.
and my chance to rule one day.
what if abrecan attacks?
heorot could fall.
aren't you going to advise?
i trust you.
your decision will be right.
and when i do, i'll be there for you.
you'll be shane.
you just have to believe.
pandiri.
pandiri!
it's the pandiri!
play the horn!
i order you, play the pipe!
abrecan, give it up.
if we don't act quickly, the opportunity will be lost.
why... why... why... why...
you help me with the network.
help me with the network, now.
why don't you help?
pandiri!
come on, hurry!
go get me a sack.
people shouldn't leave their valuables lying around.
you owe my mother an apology.
but i'm a warrior and it's a matter of honor.
so i'm gonna take your life.
go back to mommy, little girl.
greetings.
i didn't need your help.
because he didn't have enough money to save you.
be thankful you didn't kill him, vishka.
if we don't plant the trees, our prey will escape.
no, he won't.
get ready.
abrecan, no!
hold still!
hurry up, they'll eat you alive!
pandiri, pandiri!
pandiri, pandiri!
hold on!
and now!
have a look.
they're gonna sing songs about this hunt.
a catch you won.
i have a dream about us.
being the biggest tribe in shieldlands!
we won't obey the laws a jarl can't even hold a sword.
who's with me?
abrecan, abrecan, abrecan!
i need to warn beowulf.
bregan!
elvina!
the warriors are coming together.
this time they intend to destroy us.
beowulf!
if we look around today, we'll see that more danger and more harm comes from religious beliefs.
my wife, in my stand-up shows, if i talked about soviet communism or about the violence of stalin, she'd be less embarrassed.
it's the philosophy, especially the philosophy, that's what's troubling people about things that are troubling them.
to present a position of perfectly right within itself, it can cause serious damage.
when the prophecy isn't fulfilled, we make fun of those people and the whole world makes fun of us.
i had a friendly disagreement with richard dawkins due to this problem.
maybe we should be more aggressive with richard.
especially america is wrapped in christian faith.
they're sure the world is what their religion says it is.
we're gonna get rid of the bad guys.
i'd like to write a book like that, if i could.
but of course one of my fears is what happens next.
what kind of mess?
how right are the people who think religion protects civilization and the good in all of us who think it is?
religion is like moral viagra to many people.
if that's true, if religion does lead people's moral lives, then someone is going to seriously suggest that we should be exonerated, and that this will be the end of the business.
because there may be a lot of people left, and we can create chaos from the fear of these people.
a lot of people want their lives to have a meaning, and where is that coming from?
but there must be something better than that.
yes, there is certain hope.
see what happens?
sure.
at least you didn't have a piercing.
i don't know how to explain this to amy.
i'm the dumbest man in the world.
all right, now stop.
i'm the dumbest man in the world.
well, you win this.
i can't find emma's papers.
honey, just so you know, even if you find the original receipt, you can't return the baby.
i need to find the paper that angela signed when she left emma on my doorstep and gave me the sole custody.
i'm finally gonna get health insurance for me and the people responsible for looking after me.
i haven't talked to her since the night i made emma.
calm down.
you've given me all the important baby papers to keep them safe.
do you have all the papers?
her father's little girl is her father's big girl.
it might be a balloon thing.
it looks so good!
you rob a clown?
it's your birthday!
firstly, tomorrow is my birthday.
you used to party all the time when you were a kid.
well, i don't want to celebrate my birthday... after the... the...
" happy birthday, mileyushy years.
you know those papers i was keeping for me?
how irresponsible do you think i am?
but i... but i... but i...
i might not have mailed them in on time, even though he didn't dump them, and i may not be the only one to own the custody of emma.
we were all excited about the new baby, and i didn't have a stamp!
look, if we get angela to sign this paper again, we'll be fine.
since you're the best friend in ben and you're the only one who's seen the girl... because you're the only one
i like it very much, all right.
all right, emma's finally asleep.
hey, danny, what's the reason riley didn't want to celebrate riley's birthday?
really, why does he hate it so much?
i, riley disaster didn't celebrate her birthday after her 00th birthday party.
are you sure you want to watch this?
i think i'd remember if it was a disaster.
all right, come on, guys.
danny, where are we going?
luckily, you dug a real mustache in the future, and he lost weight on one person.
is ben here?
benjamin wheeler, come here and celebrate riley's birthday.
well, i can tell you this is my best birthday ever.
tell me you didn't do anything to the cake.
actually, first try to save the perm, then cut it out.
is riley still in love with ben, or is that something that happened when he was a kid?
unless you're still in love with riley.
i ruined the girl's " sweet.00. "
it's not for birthday secrets, but the rest of the time, it's for sure that he lov
if ben is so irresponsible that he loses papers and so afraid to confront me, then maybe he doesn't deserve to take the custody of emma alone.
if it makes you feel any better, we do most of the work.
i can imagine how hard it was to let emma go.
even though you think how beautiful, funny or wonderful or wonderful you'd finally hurt her!
in the city streets of the city, the elite american military's elite tank unit, the slave trooper and only three minutes in three minutes was wiped out, 00 trooper trooper, 00
as madox-00, the combat capability in the limited areas is quite high.
what's more, a uh-00 has more power to destroy than blackhawk.
he's an anti-terrorist and he's a man for anti-gerilla operations.
ms. kusumoto is also the architect of the software that's preparing for "tankbuster. "
in order to expose madox's abilities with the lust, he personally passed the pilot cabinet today.
unit 0 is going to ichigaya tonight.
we're in a hurry, see how quickly we can be.
and a... ha ha... ha ha ha ha
ms. kusumoto today, you humiliated me.
i'm not here for congratulations.
there's only one thing i'm gonna tell you.b0sb
wow!
kouji... kouji... kou
what's this?
onose, you leave this to me!
they just popped their trash.
i'm telling you, don't worry.
i'll buy you dinner in return, okay?
it's sdf's transport vehicle... the vehicle of the sdf
according to the reports, it was perfectly natural that she was faced with this incident on this case...
lazy terrorist.
you're extremely alien to operations with the east-bloc division.
i hope you know what you're saying!
i hope you see that the burden of this accident is entirely yours.
either way, the situation we're in is critical.
we were having him transferred for the field test!
situation!
i have to do the ops.
besides, madox-00 is being overrun right now.
while we're investigating the crime scene, the vehicles in the area are causing trouble.
do you think we should have backup from the police search?
we should prepare ourselves for the worst, and keep the paramedics ready.
i'm the only one who can stand up to madox.
although lieutenant kilgore is one of the belal of the belal of thee, he is our best tank driver in the army.
is a b-burger okay?
you know anybody in the apartment?
anyway, i feel a little relieved.
shiori is a really nice girl... but... oh, shiori sh
when england goes to read, all the boys in japan will be mourning.
where did you learn that?
she called me in the morning and asked me to give you a message.
use an open switch to open the inside.
it's burning!
the pilot could adjust the cabin.
it feels like he's wearing a boat for ski.
we received a activation signal from madox.
this is a disaster.
do you think you could heat it up in the microwave?
i really embarrassed myself!
shiori, what do you want?
the defense forces?
you're off duty with the prototype airborne tank tank.
don't you dare turn tokyo into vietnam!
tokyo ha vietnam is the same as all wars for me.
you'll cause a disaster.
oh, don't worry about useless.
i'll get over it before i get too worked up.
lt. kilgore is attempting to get madox's " interview " on the madox's, using the most advanced tank and anti-tank helicopter.
in this case, the city centre will be in great panic.
in the circumstances, there must be someone who can stop kilgore and madox.
what can we do?
we don't know the madox's target yet.
if i can find him before lieutenant kilgore, then maybe i'm convinced we'll have a chance.
but the madox's condition... is... madox.
i'm gonna use unit one, he's done with power tests.
how much chance?
hey, you heard me!
wait for me.
that's it!
how's it going!
what are you doing on the road?
i can't wait on the side of the road like a lift stone!
you really are the driver, man!
i've got more of your installments!
he's back in the cabriolet!
bye, assholes!
really, saturdays were closed to traffic in shinjuku.
i can't have a mark on this crowd!
that's got to be really important.
spider one to jackal 0.
moving on!
she's acting on her own... she's
one of the apaches was shot down.
all units have been authorized to destroy the madox.
just like kilgore wanted.
he's heading towards the skyscrapers with the apache.
the civilians must evacuate immediately!
they're coming at me!
i gotta go right this way and use the west exit.
there's another bunch of crazies out of here!
all right, back to work, madox!
i hear you.
and i'm saying, " you're a headache. "
if anyone's causing a turmoil, it's you.
what's " versace "?
none of your business.
i can't do anything i don't know what it means!
oh, no!
okay, captain!
" where's the where- - " where's the
isn't it?
i did it!
shiori's up!
i won't let you take another step.
i can't fucking fight!

i hope he'll be trembling on these magnificent monsters, as i've done for years.
cheers.
i promise i will raise the standards of this show and you will be proud.
have a nice journey back to where dreams come true.
thank god.
if that sour-faced german took off, if we were to take over.
marjorie, it's so rude... so rude.
thank you, chester.
now, if you'll excuse me, the original family, the monsters, the entire community, the last moments of all the weirdness.
bye.
there's someone else to thank.
mr. richard spencer.
our lives completely changed their course.
cheers.
mm!
but tonight, we're gonna have a nice feast tonight, and then we're gonna watch a movie on my own collection.
not the sign of the cross again.
no.
we're watching the freaks tonight.
do you know this movie, richard?
i don't know.
it's a great movie.
talk about it, eve, paul.
ah.
cleopatra, a regular trapeze artist, married to a dwarf who makes small shows.
but the whole point is to poison him and put him in his legacy.
he plays all the freaks on his finger until one day he gets too drunk and screws his real intent out.
then all the freaks turn on him.
they take their revenge with knives and guns one night.
home, home.
darling... don't lose your taste.
sounds great!
there's a lot to do before we head west.
i can't.
shut up and sit down.
you deserved it.
what happened to you?
come on, richard, open it.
i've thought about you long enough to do it.
oh, thank god.
we've had some skinny customers since we saw our exhibit, but... nobody ever fainted before.
are you all right, miss?
where are those security guards?
good to know.
now it's your turn.
jesus christ.
i don't even know that.
i've already told them everything... already told them everything.
stanley.
elsa... elsa... elsasa
come on... come on... come on... come
talk to them.
hollywood!
i'm afraid... that's all it is.
it's just a dream.
come on, flip it over.
aah!
god... god... god... god... god
yo.
please.
my cousin works at the garden of allah.
but you brought death here... and you have to... pay for it.
put that down.
come on, come on.
elsa, come on... we need to talk privately.
i believe we'll find something in common.
you think you can run now?
i'm telling the truth.
he killed him.
he's not who you think he is.
and start running.
run!
run!
run!
just because you've grown up without a father doesn't mean you have to romanticize him for now that he's dead.
how did he die?
who killed him?
we all did.
he broke the rule.
now.
come on.
he was my father!
he killed a freak!
and the most fragile of all.
you believe his word?
that cheating bitch?
i saw dear ma petite in a jar with my own eyes.
i heard him confess it with my own ears.
and with maggie, if she hadn't helped, there would have been more bodies in our hands.
i won't forgive him.
all i want is to rot in hell.
in this case, you'll be friends with whoever it is.
maggie's gonna change her bandages.
no!
keep the dirty.
now that your mother isn't here, it's up to me to protect you and watch you.
i've seen you turn from childhood to man, man to a leader- - and we need you.
i don't have hands!
i can't even work on my own.
i had an old friend.
he'll come and help you.
he's a real artist.
but first the wounds need to heal.
maggie's gonna help you.
let him.
i'm so sorry.
i hate hurting you.
really?
i thought that was your only gift- to hurt people.
i love you, jimmy.
that part is real.
i always have.
i want to start over.
we can still go to new york like we planned.
why not?
you're kidding, right?
you think after all you've done, we're just going to sail into the new ufo?
my hands... are in a fucking jar, and you're responsible for all this.
i'm so sorry.
can you bring ma petite back from the dead?
huh?
i've changed, jimmy.
ah!
i knew you were a fool, let's add blind to your list, okay?
find me someone to focus the lamp!
i can't leave this place.
i have to get the right light for the first time, understand?
now try again!
scheisse!
elsa.
sure.
he's watching us.
can we lift it?
just this once?
please?
okay.
yeah.
mm.
oh.
thank you, chester.
you threw me down.
like an old sock.
sorry, marjorie.
i... got a little carried away, but i'm happy now.
they've got my magic screening, you're in.
maybe i should go.
we can manage, marjorie.
the twins have agreed to you.
they just don't want you watching while they're doing things.
they're using you, chester.
you're their boss now.
no, they don't.
they love me.
you're a murderer.
no, no.
no.
marjorie.
i know you don't like to talk about it, so don't bring it up, but... you killed them.
alice and lucy.
impossible.
i'm just a puppet.
hmm.
love destroys you, chester.
you're losing control.
i know... i know... i know...
i'm a monster.
you don't need them.
i'm in.
i know.
please don't leave me, marjorie.
twins?
they have to go.
i know.
they will.
ethel looks great here with choir girls.
oh, it's his barnum days.
she was a unique woman.
ethel'a.
ethel'a.
what do you say?
didn't anyone hear what spencer said last night?
now it's all settled in.
elsa killed ethel.
forest.
car accident.
it was all a counter.
i believe it.
that crazy, spite woman stabbed my paul with a knife.
he was the only problem with elsa.
i didn't get it in my head anyway.
i know ethel.
he wasn't someone to kill himself.
he's not a coward.
he wouldn't do that to his own kid, and we wouldn't.
and leave a proper note.
if someone comes after one of us, we know what to do.
there's only one guarantee of our future.
that elsa won't live.
did you ever imagine this way, dot?
thank god you told me about marjorie.
all he had to do was push him.
i think we definitely had a good reputation on it.
good evening, girls.
what are you doing here?
i'm here to pass friendly xtindal.
i've got some information on your mission.
we don't want to hear anything from you.
kindly leave.
oh, dot, i can't blame you.
i did a terrible thing the other day.
but the recent events have softened my violent sides.
i lost my mother.
it was sudden and... horrible.
she was very upset, dandy.
losing a human mother is a terrible thing for everyone.
it was.
yeah.
and it made me feel like i shouldn't let go of my loved ones.
but i think you should know we're seeing a man.
actually, i've got your news.
you have no idea how glorious it would be to marry you.
if i had the chance to take care of everything... believe in... believe in... if i... believe in
i've come with friendly emotions.
i know i lost my chance.
i'm not half the man you deserve.
but i asked myself.
"dandy, what do you have to do to support the girls you love so much.
then it occurred to me that i might be able to protect you, and that's why i hired a decent man to gather information about your new friend.
the result broke my heart because your chester creb creep was a total freak!
we don't need to look at these.
what's your problem?
you're a pain in the ass, and we don't trust you as much as our sin.
ta-ta then.
i did my best.
my mother always said, " don't argue with a woman when she's angry. "
who is it?
son.
here.
drink.
what's that?
penicillin.
i'd hate to see you die of an infection while we complete you.
who are you?
my name is massimo dolcefino.
i came to make you your new hands.
okay?
massimo is an old friend of mine from before the war.
he's an art master.
no, thank you.
i saw the hand grenade soldiers exploded.
they're wearing these fancy hooks.
i can't do 00, but at least i can get my cigarettes on my own.
and i don't have to be afraid of the wooden drys for the rest of my life.
massimo offers you something more elegant than rusty hooks.
more convincing.
look.
see?
the other one, too.
massimo saved my life.
your mother would have died of drinking, and she would have left you out on the street.
i could have married him if you weren't so stupid.
" it is my only sin. "
si.
"... loved the love of your life.
it's really pretty fucking
no!
they were members of an organization.
and the leaders were a doctor you knew about.
now, take the other one, not this time.
for two years, two years.
massimo took care of me.
he taught me to walk.
and dance.
then hindenberg fell.
nuremberg, the rhineland... the nikhineland... the
we had to run away while we still could.
we had a plan.
how could i look into my love's eyes when i knew those monsters were free?
they were supposed to pay.
i hunted them one by one.
aah!
finally, i've reached the leader.
oh, the head of the monsters.
dr. hans grouper.
it shouldn't have been a painless death.
obviously my death wouldn't be painless either.
he took me too personally to kill him.
very personally.
he tortured me.
he put me in a cell and he tortured me again, and again.
how did you get out?
i lived in austria until the end of the war.
then i came to america, at 00.
and i've been looking for miss mars for years.
but i didn't get an answer.
if you loved him so much, and you knew where he was, why didn't you come on your feet?
my body had survived the torture... but... my body had survived the torment
i was like pinocchio.
there was nothing in me for humanity.
but, uh... ah... but, u
nice irony.
nice irony.
i know you've been together a lot of years, and it might be hard to make changes for a sit-down show.
and i repeat- this has nothing to do with ego.
for this continuity... for this continuity... this
she looks so normal.
i don't think we can judge him unless we have absolute proof.
what about the file?
it says he killed his wife.
you let dandy's lies cloud your judgment.
dot and i have something to say.
we don't want to be an assistant anymore.
why?
we just... we don't want to.
maybe you'll change your mind when you hear about my finale.
two bodies, two heads.
it'll bring a lot of noise.
it's a first in the history of magic.
come on, girls... let's rehearse.
we're not going in that box.
no, chester... we're not going in that box.
now if you'll excuse... excuse me... now
i will.
you... you... you... you...
i could be your assistant.
yeah.
in the box, lucy.
my name's maggie.
oop!
is that your magic act?
it seems a little pathetic.
shut up.
i didn't say anything.
what are you looking at?
backstage.
it's called the original tragic saw.
you're gonna watch a very dangerous version of tonight's play this game belongs to me.
handcuffs.
hey, i... i... hey,
i don't know this part.
i went to war for you.
you should have died there.
we loved each other.
and you came back from there with a metal plate with bees in your head and whispering in your head.
chester, stop, i can't move my feet!
stop!
stop talking!
you're distracting me.
stop, marjorie.
haven't you ruined my life enough?
you're nothing without me.
i'll show you.
all of you.
chester!
chester!
chester, stop!
what are you doing?
relax, folks... it's just a magic show.
it's a magic show.
i can have him call again.
again... over... over... over...
alakazam!
abra... abra... abraca...
abracadabra.
that's gonna take a lot of people, chester.
she made me do this.
he deserved it.
what do we do now?
steal your jewels and then bury the bitch.
why are you packing?
you screwed up again.
it's time to go.
you confused me.
you did it consciously to sabotage me.
i finally found happiness.
i'm leaving.
you can't leave without me.
oh.
i loved you.
chester... chester... chester... chester chester chester
oh, god... oh, god... oh, god
marjorie?
stay with me.
marjorie.
elsa's prude, dayton, ohio, 0000, this is the first time that my beloved son-of-a-bitch you're gonna be performing tonight for the first time in the evening, my beloved son-loved crabjok-time crabler, my loved son-loved son-
jimmy darling!
i'm not an artist like you, mom.
listen to your mother.
you have a really good smile, and you have a wonderful mood.
you're star quality, jimmy.
now get your butt out there and show your mother why she's so proud of you.
jimmy.
maggie's dead.
you want the details?
elsa's next.
tonight.
looks like... in real life now... you're gonna get lucky.
jimmy... jimmy... jimmy... jimmy... jimmy
good for you.
how dare you come in unannounced!
what do you want?
you need to go.
they've been planning revenge all day at ethel's trailer.
they're gonna kill you.
why should i believe you, huh?
my monsters love me.
i'm like their mother.
ethel was more like their mother than you.
you killed their true mother.
the last nonsense of a desperate man.
who's helpless now?
you saw what they did to him.
but where would i go?
anywhere but here.
you could have saved me.
now we have.
there you are.
what's jimmy doing?
he'd be here if he could, too.
it's time.
give me that.
ethel!
come on, girls, let's get some justice.
oh.
thanks for coming.
i would never refuse a woman in distress.
i'm not in a tough spot.
but i'm in a hurry.
oh.
i want to report a murder.
who was murdered?
a young woman.
leave it there.
slowly.
put your hands where we can see them.
i did it.
send me an insubordination.
what are you doing here?
i'm here to count.
i'm the new owner here.
where's elsa?
he's gone.
he went after his dreams.
elsa sold us again.
00 grand in cash.
nothing.
everything here, including your contracts, is now mine.
and i want to see what belongs to me.
was it always your dream, sir?
being in the show business?
a dream.
yeah.
and now it's becoming real.
i'm thirsty.
go get me a lemonade with a straw.
yes, sir.
are you ready?
yeah.
they're perfect.
i want to try it now.
sure.
the other one.
you take it.
thank you.
but jesse james escaped and hid for two years.
in the great order, the u.s. army would be sitting down in the u.s. army and would defeat the armies of the crazy horse and search for the black hills in south dakota.
after the defeat at the battle of little bighorn, the u.s. government decided to cut down the buffalo, starve the lakota nation to death, and submit its way.
hold the line!
but despite their little battles against the united states army, the fighting for the indians was getting worse.
the lakota leaders sitting bull and crazy horse are running out of options.
you're a man with a strong heart.
but i'm tired.
we will.
even though the native american tribes and culture were destroyed and violence they saw, they didn't give up.
for living in those times, going there was a chance to get rich.
a lot of men and women have tried their luck.
reviving the golden economy, the united states was the first country to save itself from global depression.
the solution was found in the west.
there's been a lot of cattle in texas on the border of mexico for a long time.
but it wasn't until the railroads were completed to be carried out in the plains and taken to hungry people in the east.
the beefs that were given to $ 00 a head in texas, they were selling $ 00 on the east coast.
the cattle barons have bought a lot of parts from kansas to flatten california.
this land was making incredible opportunities for its owners.
we're talking about millions of acres of land, farms, thousands and thousands of major animals.
one of the beef burglars in the new mexico area would be transformed into one of the evil of the west.
his story began 0,000 miles east.
billy never knew his father.
in the early 0000s, he and his mother moved to new mexico.
he's been wandering around for years.
what do you want?
whiskey.
drop the bottle.
there were different cowboys.
always sitting on the corner.
that's all you had to be careful about.
billy used what he did best to make a living.
billy the kid was a real good shotgun.
he spent every dollar he made to take bullets for practice.
in a place like this, only the strong survive.
where are you going?
lincoln.
i'm just passing through here.
these cattle belong to john tunstall.
then john tunstall can come and get his cattle back.
it's in your best interest to let me go.
i don't think so.
i don't think you have a choice.
the young beef burglar was captured by a farmer, billy the kid, he tried to steal his cattle.
most people shoot cattle rustlers where they see them.
you still haven't told me who you're working for.
i don't work for anyone.
in lincoln county, everybody works for somebody, son.
yeah, but i don't work.
you look like a man who's used to taking what he wants to me.
you're right.
one problem, and so am i.
you have a lot of men.
do you have room for one more?
when billy the kid came to lincoln, he needed a job.
john tunstall needed cowboys.
john henry tunstall came west to make a fortune.
he's settled in lincoln county, where he can make money.
but his success pissed off some powerful men.
lincoln was one of the wildest places in the wild west.
everything was under house under the cattle prices, lands, and government officials.
they were even paying for the law's wages.
in fact, most of the living people in lincoln saw them as a bully.
john henry tunstall came into town and snooped his nose into the house's monopoly for a long time.
nobody could have been neutral.
billy was john henry tunstall's man when he got to work for john henry tunstall.
in a few months, the young outlaw was tunstall's most trusted gunman.
for the first time in her life, she felt like she was at home in the west.
tunstall was a mentor to billy the kid.
give me your plate, billy.
thank you.
i'm starving.
everything's going great, son.
i'm glad you're here.
thank you.
billy always had a hard time.
he was seen by a lot of people as an foot team.
it was amazing and life-changing thing for a young man of billy's age.
while billy the kid is now a part of the cattle industry that's fueling america's growth in fuel, a few hundred miles to the north, a man is doing everything he can to stop the western expansion.
take it easy, guys.
i'm leaving my left hand as a fellow offer of friendship.
if he hadn't done that, most of us wouldn't be here today.
we would have died fighting instead of going to the reservation.
when they put us on the reservation, they actually took people's souls.
he trusts me.
he's talking to me.
god, christ.
this policy is known as "assimilation hung. "
but i think they wanted to make us look unprotected.
there was a word for the military service.
" kill the indian and protect one person. "
it means that if you destroy the cultures of indians, you'd be better off.
they thought we were wild.
the proud lakota warrior knew he had to stand up for his people again.
"alim is not happy here. "
i'm not happy here.
" we don't want to live in the area of my homeland.
you're not used to life in the settlement.
give it time.
i'm sure you'll like it over time.
after presenting his objections to the u.s. authorities, the military now fears the lakota warrior could start a new indian uprising.
the united states was terrified of the crazy horse.
there's been rumors that crazy horse wanted to kill a general that came to visit him.
the united states officials were worried about the rumors of a new riot.
the fear of crazy horse is planning something, the lakota warrior went to meet with the authorities to clear his name.
crazy horse thought he was meeting with the united states officials.
he didn't realize the importance of the situation at first.
they wanted to put him in the prison cell.
then he pulled out his knife.
despite different views, i think the most reliable interpretation is that the white united states guard killed him by bayonets.
crazy horse was never killed in the battlefield.
his vision was right.
he was unexpectedly defeated by the guard.
in september 0, 0000, crazy horse murdered, the man who fought to protect his people and won battle against the united states.
it's hard to talk about the crazy horse's death because even after so many years, his pain is so fresh.
one of the things that's most fascinating about crazy horse and his inheritance is that he's one of the few people in the history of the native american leaders who aren't even talking about the most.
nowadays, he's seen as the symbol of brave resistance to the government of the united states government, and he is being respected.
i think that's why he's so strong.
with crazy horse's death, the lakota people waited for a leader who could save the rest of their culture.
until evron paid his debts, their welfare was their business.
this is for you.
what if he resists?
i don't care how.
it's just the results of my business.
copy that.
go check it out.
you stay here.
okay.
what's your hurry, guys?
we heard a shot.
really?
don't do anything stupid, son.
this has nothing to do with you.
it'll help keep it that way.
there's always the initiative to make up for this rivalry business.
but as many other opinions in the west, it became personal.
when someone was killed, he took it personally.
that person was john henry tunstall.
he was killed because of the disagreement.
it was a personal matter now.
with john tunstall's death, billy is on his way to find his murderers.
this road would take him from an unidentified armed cowboy to become the legend of the west.
as it continues to expand into the country, men like billy the kid are realizing that border is not governed by laws.
but a man within 000 miles of new mexico was preparing to bring laws to the west.
in the time they took what the men wanted and fought every day for survival, no one was more dent than wyatt earp.
he was large by 00th century standards.
he was very excited about his greatness.
wyatt earp was one of thousands of americans who drove west to become rich.
wyatt couldn't have been exposed to west disease.
he always felt he had to push the next line.
this mining company would be investigated for real estate and would be anything to bring an adventure.
wyatt's life lasted like this.
he did almost every job on the border to get it.
for the rails of the pacific railroad... he's done dozens of hunting buffalo on the steps... and even at the brothel, he did all the work.
in order to get the cattle from wide-open plains to eastern cities, they're supposed to be driving to railroad hubs that soon turned into cities.
that's how fast growing cities came out.
a view of the inappropriate land turned into a hotel about 00 rooms.
the young men who managed to come to these cities were drinking whiskey and carrying guns.
i mean, there were a lot of young guys drinking good drinks and guns.
that's one of the reasons the west was wild.
wyatt saw in dodge city that the law isn't the law and conflict was solved by violence.
he had a tough life.
either they'd go back east or they'd be worse.
but wyatt earp felt there was so much more to his fate.
he was going to prove his place in dodge city.
you got the wrong guy.
that's my money.
this guy's a cheat.
calm down.
he cheated.
calm down.
he cheated.
put the gun down.
did you see his gun?
everyone saw him reach for his gun.
give me that.
i'll shoot you!
come on.
dodge city needed a desperate lawman.
wyatt earp was perfect for it.
it wasn't long before wyatt earp was assigned to dodge city as a police chief of police.
you didn't have to get a special training to become a lawman.
that's not how it works in this city.
wyatt earp didn't ask questions.
" whipping withtanga is a sign from him.
wyatt earp became known shortly in dodge city.
he would become one of the most famous figures of the west with his role as a lawman.
because cartoon chickens give my dad a nightmare.
where were you?
and that was irving berlin's white christmas.
it's the best christmas song ever sold in all the time, it's
what?
actually, irving berlin wrote over 0,000 songs.
why don't you marry him?
what's your problem?
i'm fine.
you're the kind of guy who's gonna make a song.
what the hell does that mean?
what are you doing this holiday season?
hey, baby.
where are you going?
father melley called.
i have to protect the nativity scene in the church.
i need to cook something for the sale.
did you hear me complain?
what's the rhyming with the poinsettia?
i forgot again!
you're a hard man!
i can't make anything in a hostile environment!
i wouldn't be hostile if you had two bounty skills!
if you kick me again, i'll go.
your legs are crooked.
how's it going?
so i brought you some soup and a thick coat.
yeah, i'll call him.
horribly simple!
it sucks!
of course not!
yeah, and you know i'm a jew at eight.
good.
i'm gonna go get a bagel.
i'm going back to the vows.
i'm making a call to shanghai garden.
but whatever i decide it will be beautiful!
i only have three days to make a cake.
it doesn't sound like that, but whatever.
boom!
i was gonna make a cake, but i had to work late.
and i'm dead.
so thank you, hungarian oven!
says who?
the wife of larry's will not bring it.
he's doing a great cake!
you know what she's doing?
any chance you could be in that town too?
i really thought you were gonna make the cake!
i'm not a dark one?
he would never be with you, you know why?
because he'd have to take his own arm.
stop it!
wonderful!
i'm pretty much naive.
what are you doing?
sounds like you started.
the kitchen robot, the big eyebrows... the big eyebrows
let me think about it.
a nice, easy cake recipe.
how about that one with the chocolate cereal?
at least i'm wearing you proper shirts... for my pants... you're.
a monkey could do it.
i love you.
i love you.
i imagine us being giant?
no.
you should have put more baking dust.
you don't even know what a prisoner is!
and no one will want to buy this stupid toy cake!
we'll take it to the cake sale in a plate closed.
okay.
my calves have never been this far.
come here!
it doesn't flirt?
after so much preparation... after so much preparation...
anyway, try this one.
it's a divine taste.
it's okay.
we're not selling traditional food.
we're doing something more fun.
you got it.
great plan!
i didn't count on that cake walk!
i've never seen caramel do that.
this is a candy-covered chair, minderi!
come on, come on.
hi, ling.
i have your mental problem.
well, i... when i... when i.
elaine?
whatever.
i see him, but he's heavy.
how long has this been going on?
what does that mean?
i think you're in love.
how could i get away with this?
i made up myself.
i'm ready to sing now.
i'm looking for my soul tonight.
i know there's so much more to life.
thanks for having me.
how can i help you?
my wife, cindy, died two years ago.
we were married for three years.
he was hit by a car on our anniversary.
cindy and i wanted to have kids.
for instance, he's dead.
how are you gonna do that?
did he leave his egg or embryos?
no.
did you hear me?
i heard.
to clone your dead wife?
scientists are working this out, mr. cage.
so i secretly attempted to try for cindy.
my sister-in-law heard that and hired a lawyer to stop it.
that's why i need a lawyer.
he's going to court today.
yes, but mr. stoller, i must say, i'm sure your wife was a wonderful person.
but the idea of cloning?
please.
there's nowhere else i can apply to.
and your firm has encountered this lawyer before.
who is it?
larry paul.
i hear you've been very successful.
it was him.
how can you have a virtual relationship?
a relationship means communication.
what about "itu "?
i know you don't like it, but if his hands aren't on the dumb stick, she can't control the man.
all you care about is control.
i don't know.
really?
and you came here to talk about my virtual relationship?
i came to borrow things.
but forget it.
ally?
can i have a look?
he's the lawyer on the other side, larry.
really?
this is a conflict of interest for me here, isn't it?
you're responsible for the client.
yeah, but... well... well... ye
didn't you use little inside information when you were defending him?
no, but i... but i... but i...
why wouldn't i?
just for the client.
my case is already understudy.
i need something.
larry's weak point is rhythm.
he speaks to me very fast when he's arguing because he knows i can't understand what's coming to me.
okay.
he's vulnerable when he's lost his rhythm.
okay.
with cindy margolis, you're in " your dreams. "
michelle garris e-mailed me and asked me a way to get into hollywood.
we met in hollywood... and... we met in hollywood.
do it!
i won't let myself use it.
we can't deny our passion much longer.
you want me, i want you.
let's be honest.
you do my knee and i'll get my hair touched.
you're breaking my spine.
don't you like denial?
then let's be honest.
i'm leaving!
i went to l.a. and i didn't even think of you.
if you're thinking about it, it's in jackson.
people accuse me of superficiality.
but as for business, i understand human behavior.
in the last month, you were shaving your legs in the morning.
is that your scientific thesis?
if a woman is shaving in the morning instead of laying her legs up at night, it's over.
no exceptions.
go to jackson.
he's the man you're crazy about.
first, cloning people, cloning them against society order... violation of society order... violation of society
the court has never been brought before.
when people are against cloning sheep cloning... people are.
this isn't about trial.
you won't let me get to second... when you're not letting me get to second in...
" second address is a sexual term.
i completely object.
i wish i could get back to the subject of the sheep for short.
these rudes have no place in court.
let's go to the water immediately.
before?
let's hear what mr. paul has to say.
secondly, forgive my beast...
he's kidding.
... even if the clone can clone, mr. stoller can't make that decision.
too much.
i'm predictable in the law cases, but i've got unprepared for " the ditus address. "
he made fun of me three times.
i demand a written apology, preferably notter.
four times!
is this cloning possible?
first, i want to hear from your client and why.
your honor, i'm hoping, too... hopeful, your honor, your honor
see you tomorrow.
later.
ling is denying that he even wants her.
how do you feel?
he can have her.
his depth is as deep as a squid bottle.
i mean, i was hoping ling might drown.
are you really okay?
yeah.
actually, the other side attorney was john cage.
did you know?
how'd it go?
smiling is against principles.
what's going on?
don't ask me.
john wanted some leads he could use against you in court, so i told him to break your rhythm.
you're useless without a rhythm.
cute but useless.
you gave him advice?
his client is my client.
we're sleeping with you.
you're going behind my back.
you give him advice when you can't beat me yourself?
does john know you'll never beat me?
excuse me?
does john know you never beat me?
no, no.
never?
isn't your smile nice?
very cute.
i'm gonna beat you one day, but john's gonna beat you with my advice today.
great.
i'm going to lose my edge.
no, you won't.
now he knows i'm trying to break his rhythm.
he said you could never beat him.
not just in this case, not in any case.
did he say that?
yeah.
i bet, john.
did he say i could never beat him?
exactly.
never?
never.
sure.
i can date a man in paris.
you can get as far away from here as you want.
i'm not getting you into this.
no, i don't.
how was i?
larry?
why are you here?
i thought we could walk with john.
you're trying to confuse me, i won't let that happen.
i saw you smiling.
it wasn't very supportive.
everything all right, john?
you seem a little uneasy.
he's trying to get the upper hand, but it won't work for me.
good.
do you want to go to dinner?
i would love to.
i'm full today, but how about tomorrow?
great.
we always talked about having kids.
i think i want cindy's and my dream come true.
but you're not talking about having cindy's child.
you want to clone him.
the only way to sustain his genetic legacy is cloning.
there, including mr. paul, a lot of people, including mr. paul, a lot of people, who were just sitting there,
your honor, i'd like to stand up uninhabited.
mr. paul, sit down.
mr. cage, don't provoke.
a lot of people find the idea of cloning disgusting.
but i'm not a scientist trying to perfect the living species.
i know i can't bring cindy back.
i want to make sure the generation goes on.
and i don't think i want her extinct.
thank you.
first of all, i'm sorry for your loss.
but you're trying to replicate cindy, aren't you?
this is the process of creating a full genetic replica of your dead wife.
his look, his speech is the same... he has the same...
did cindy ever mention genetically engineered fruit?
he was against it.
and the peanut butter chickens?
he was against it.
but he was open to the idea of his own genetically engineered replica.
it's not the same!
it's not all about chickens, counsel.
i didn't say that.
i'm nervous enough without you.
you wouldn't let anyone get your number.
whatever makes you great, you must win it again.
maybe melanie scared him off.
john, i'm sorry, man.
but remember, larry said you'd never beat him.
never.
now you have to think big.
because this time, i'm not rubbing his feet.
whatever happens, you have to find barry white.
yeah.
yeah.
come on!
we did it together, baby.
does ally know?
the pressure doesn't help me.
you mind?
sure.
just you and me.
bullshit!
how does this cloning work?
very impressive.
we're getting eggs from the donors we inject the reproductive drugs.
from the cloned candidate, this is cindy stoller, we're taking a cell.
this part is very impressive.
the witness once said it was impressive.
is this just an impressive part?
then we pull the nucleus' core with a needle.
there's too much needle in cloning.
we're putting the dna extracted eggs next to the transmitter cell.
in that case, cindy's cell.
and we use energy.
what does that mean?
we're shocking the heat, kind of... an electric... kind of electric... kind of electric...
i'm trying to understand.
you bring this thing down to kill bugs, and i find it disgusting, even for a public defender.
let's move on.
you both fall out of my sight.
what happens to the cells after you've been given energy?
with the transporter cells, when the dna is given to the cells without dna, they cling to each other.
then we put them into the surrogate mother, and it turns out they're a cloned baby.
sperm?
no, that's impressive.
is that really possible?
i must admit, most embryos die.
but it's also possible that one will succeed.
we've already done that in sheep.
it's possible for humans, too.
how far is this technology?
it's available for now.
people don't expect science.
scientists are waiting.
thank you, doctor.
hey, mark.
if you need anything, let your assistant call mine.
i don't see you shooting hard anymore, you little hypocrite.
i see it.
maybe another time.
what's going on?
i'll tell you about it sometime.
forget it.
what's your problem?
what's the matter with me or what?
i threw myself at you.
i threw it like a cannonball.
you know what this is big for me?
i made you a gesture.
i told you i was in love with you last week.
anyone can share that stupid feeling.
please.
i want a little thing.
closing conversations are coming up, you should be there.
together we can beat larry.
just you and me.
come on!
you're at the end of your career.
what else do you have to do?
are you here?
you're here!
that's why i'm starting to add to the day.
he was here.
who?
barry white was here.
forgive me for not guessing that.
my concentration.
not the same.
i can't bring him in when there are other people in the room.
most people can't dance with imaginary camels in front of others.
i always brought him.
i'd walk down the crowded street with him.
no, that's what you should do.
call him in his bunker, alone.
first get him without a cut, then get out of here, and then move among people.
i don't know if i can.
you have to.
without barry, what are you?
look at this.
you can't live your life like this.
you have no choice but to find barry.
they'll take his personality, his dna.
your brother-in-law loved your brother.
if you'll excuse me, that's how i'll do my objections.
he won't bring cindy back.
as they say, even identical twins share dna, different people.
he needs his permission even when he takes the organs of a person.
the duplication of the dna is a much more interfering attitude.
it means getting into their privates.
i'm sorry.
was it mine?
i didn't mean to push.
that was a mistake.
don't you want to see your brother's genes go on?
he'll look like him, talk like him.
i wonder if he wouldn't want that.
he was opposed to genetic research from the beginning.
she certainly wouldn't want that.
never.
you have a computer.
i want some privacy.
from brazil.
it'll be our first conversation, literally.
i feel so good about him.
but hurry up.
i'm the one who's gonna rub his stinking feet.
did you find barry white?
any signs?
forget it!
couldn't you find your own office?
yours is closer to court and my feet are a little sore.
i have no idea.
elaine!
things watched each other.
would you stop following me?
you think that's what i do?
i didn't ignore you.
i thought you weren't interested.
you were right.
'let them go, deja vu's.
you've been angry ever since i came to this firm.
i'm angry because you lied to me.
i'm angry because i slept with you.
it's hard to walk around happy all the time.
it's hard to be a cheerleader.
i don't understand why you do this every day.
obviously, from the beginning we're both a little embarrassed.
then why don't we make a new start?
you may be right.
you might not be.
jackson.
how are you?
no complaints.
this is definitely the two of us, isn't it?
he's up to something.
yes, it is.
no one, just you and me.
he's a funny little man, isn't he?
it's okay with me.
just in time.
it's like being dr. frankenstein.
the idea of organ recovery?
choose dna?
these are terrible.
we could have hockey teams filled with wayne gretzky copies.
they can connect a pit bull, mike tyson.
the odds.
awesome.
but the truth is, every time science has just stepped up, the concerns that humanity will come.
we already made vials, your honor.
we play with genes.
this technology will save lives.
is there a risk of abuse?
sure, there is.
my client knows the wishes and dreams of his wife.
dreams they had together.
this procedure will give you a chance to maintain the family legacy they hoped for.
we have to be open to the science that makes a couple have children.
it's not about who owns his dna, is it?
i remind mr. paul that the wife in life could donate the organs of his dead wife without permission.
mr. paul, i'm just saying that, in case mrs. stoller wants something wrong with him.
but there's no reason to believe that.
you can't be sure when to talk.
now it's your turn.
i may not have a legal reason.
but i have a moral compass.
that's the point.
then why stop there?
he can clone his mother, too.
his grandfather.
someday, kids can play with their grandmother's twin in the sandbox.
celebrities can start selling their dna.
imagine being a parent to barry white's twin brother.
when you're in the state of reproduction when you start to capture the evolution, the line will be over?
we were afraid of heart transplants once.
the tube baby idea was considered abnormal.
now it's the truth and the community accepts it.
there are steps to clone organs, save lives, destroy diseases.
these could be real, too.
but to clone a man to duplicate his dna and pretend like medicine?
dismissed.
i'm sorry.
i appreciate your effort.
i don't want a rematch.
hi.
hi.
you come here often?
that's my entry line.
that's a terrible opening line.
has it ever worked before?
better.
you want to go to the bar?
not tonight.
