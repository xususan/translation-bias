3659 	 but since pleading his case to u.s. authorities, the military now fears the lakota warrior could incite an indian uprising. 	 after he offered his objection to the united states authorities, he was afraid the military would start a new indian foot in the lakota warrior. maxlen: 47
3660 	 the u.s. was incredibly scared about crazy horse. 	 the united states was scared of crazy horse. maxlen: 21

3667 	 and he comes out with knives. 	 then he pulled out his knife. maxlen: 14
3668 	 accounts here differ, but i think the most reliable interpretation is that the white u.s. sentry bayonets him, and he dies. 	 although the most trusting comments i think, the white united states guard killed him by sponging him. maxlen: 36
3669 	 crazy horse is never killed in battle in that respect. 	 crazy horse didn't get killed at the battlefield. maxlen: 17

3674 	 one of the things that's most fascinating about crazy horse and his legacy is simply the fact that of all the many native leaders across american history, he's one of the few people that most non-indians have heard about. 	 one of the most fascinating part of the most fascinating horse and disgust, one of the most fascinating side wizards in american history, is that the indians are talking about most. maxlen: 53
3675 	 i think he's seen today as a symbol of courageous resistance to the u.s. government... and he is, in many respects. 	 today, the symbol of courage against the government of the united states government is seen as a symbol of resistance, and he's being respected by himself. maxlen: 37
3676 	 and i think that's one of the reasons that makes him so powerful. 	 i think that's what makes him so strong. maxlen: 19
3677 	 with crazy horse gone, the lakota people are in desperate need of leadership if they're going to save what's left of their culture. 	 in the death of the crazy horse, the people of the lakota waited for a leader who could save the rest of their hopeless culture. maxlen: 40

4058 	 oh, balls. 	 bullshit! maxlen: 10
4059 	 how does this cloning work? 	 how does this clone happen? maxlen: 15
4060 	 oh, it's fascinating. 	 very impressive. maxlen: 11
4061 	 we harvest eggs from donors who we inject with fertility drugs. 	 we're getting eggs from the data we're injecting the creeps. maxlen: 28
4062 	 we then take cells from the cloning candidate, cindy stoller. 	 this cindy stoller from the clone, we're getting a cell. maxlen: 34
4063 	 oh, here's where it gets fascinating. 	 this part is very impressive. maxlen: 14
4064 	 the witness previously said it was "fascinating." 	 the witness said it was impressive before. maxlen: 19
4065 	 it's just now fascinating? 	 is this just an impressive part? maxlen: 15
4066 	 then we suck the nucleus out of each egg with a needle. 	 then we draw every egg core with a needle. maxlen: 23
4067 	 lots of needles in cloning. 	 there's a lot of needles in the clone. maxlen: 19
4068 	 we take the sucked-out dna-free eggs and place them with the donor cells. 	 we're putting the dna pulled eggs next to the database. maxlen: 27
4069 	 in this case, cindy's. 	 this is cindy's cell. maxlen: 18
4070 	 and we zap them. 	 and we're using energy. maxlen: 13
4071 	 what do you mean? 	 what does that mean? maxlen: 11
4072 	 we fire off a jolt, kind of like... 	 we're spooking the heat, sort of an electric... maxlen: 22
4073 	 i'm trying to get an idea. 	 i'm trying to understand. maxlen: 13
4074 	 you're planting the idea that it's like killing bugs and i find it gross, even for an ombudsman. 	 you're putting this thing down to killing bugs and i find this disgusting, even for a public inspector. maxlen: 39
4075 	 let's proceed. 	 let's keep moving. maxlen: 11
4076 	 you're both losing points with me. 	 you're both out of my sight. maxlen: 22
4077 	 what happens to the cells after you zap them? 	 after energy, what happens to the cells? maxlen: 21
4078 	 when we zap the donor cells in the dna-free cells they fuse together. 	 they're boiling each other with data cells, dnaless cells. maxlen: 31
4079 	 we then plant them in the surrogate mother and what may result is a cloned baby. 	 then we put these in the hostile mother's mother and it's a clone doll. maxlen: 32
4080 	 semen? 	 spermle? maxlen: 11
4081 	 no, it's fascinating! 	 no, that's very impressive. maxlen: 19
4082 	 is it really possible? 	 is that really possible? maxlen: 11
4083 	 most of the embryos die off, i grant you that. 	 i must confess, most embryo are dying. maxlen: 27
4084 	 but it is entirely possible that one will make it through. 	 but it's possible one of them was successful. maxlen: 19
4085 	 we've already done it with sheep. 	 we already tried that on the sheep. maxlen: 14

7221 	 i'm not sure exactly what caused it, but right now, i'm inclined to go along with the diagnosis of a seizure. 	 i'm not so sure what caused this, but right now i'm diagnosed with the fact that it's a epileptic. maxlen: 39
7222 	 the question is, what caused it? 	 the question is, what caused this? maxlen: 15
7223 	 and why is he still comatose? 	 and why not? maxlen: 13
7224 	 if you want to have another consultation on this, please do so. 	 if you're asking us to make any other talk about it, please do it. maxlen: 32

7226 	 well, having said that don't get the impression that we're going to sit by and do nothing. 	 well, don't think we're gonna sit in our place and do nothing. maxlen: 37
7227 	 we won't. 	 we don't think so. maxlen: 14

7229 	 it's just that right now, we're really shooting in the dark. 	 so far all we've done is shoot into darkness. maxlen: 25
7230 	 we really appreciate your honesty, doctor. 	 i appreciate your humility, doctor. maxlen: 26
7231 	 those tests should have been done a long time ago, shouldn't they? 	 but these tests have been done long, haven't they? maxlen: 22
7232 	 we'll keep him in icu, that way he'll be monitored at all times. 	 she's gonna sleep here for a while, so we're gonna watch her from the monitors. maxlen: 36
7233 	 and i'll check in and see him twice a day. 	 and i'm gonna check it and visit him twice a day. maxlen: 22
7234 	 i'm going to move in here with him, then, if it's okay. 	 i won't leave you till she's well. maxlen: 21
7235 	 i'm afraid, that's entirely against hospital regulations. 	 i'm afraid that's completely against hospital rules... maxlen: 22

7241 	 i talk to people passing by. 	 i come and talk to the other people. maxlen: 14
7242 	 i have this idea if i'm sitting there and i'm talking, he won't die. 	 if i sit there and talk, he won't die. maxlen: 27

7247 	 i can't explain it. 	 i can't explain this to you. maxlen: 14
7248 	 maybe i want to be there to mark the end. 	 maybe i should be there when he comes to the end. maxlen: 19
7249 	 i don't know. 	 i don't know. maxlen: 9
7250 	 to prove he was here. 	 to prove he's still here. maxlen: 17

7253 	 annie, that man got up every day of his life and went to a job he didn't like. 	 annie, this guy went to work every day in his life that he never liked. maxlen: 28
7254 	 we didn't ask him to. 	 we never asked him. maxlen: 13
7255 	 he just did it because he was the father and that was the deal he made. 	 he did it because he was his father and he had no choice. maxlen: 23
7256 	 he didn't ask himself if he was satisfied or happy. 	 he never asked himself if i was happy. maxlen: 27
7257 	 he didn't even know he had the right. 	 he never knew if he had any right. maxlen: 17
7258 	 somehow part of that deal was that we'd care for him and watch over him when he got older. 	 when that choice is old, we have to look after him and take care of him. maxlen: 28
7259 	 i screwed that up. 	 but i made it upside down. maxlen: 14
7260 	 john. 	 john. maxlen: 8
7261 	 i got embarrassed by him, by the way mom dominated him. 	 i'm embarrassed against him, but my mother told him to rule. maxlen: 25

7263 	 embarrassed that i had a marriage that failed, a job that didn't make sense, a son i'd barely recognize if i passed him on the street. 	 i'm embarrassed because i have a marriage that went bad because i have an unmanned job, and i have a son who's hard to recognize. maxlen: 57
7264 	 maybe this is more for me than for him, 	 maybe this will be too hard for me, maxlen: 15
7265 	 but i'm gonna be there when he dies. 	 but when you die, i'll be there for you. maxlen: 17
