4060 	 oh, it's fascinating. 	 very impressive. maxlen: 11
4061 	 we harvest eggs from donors who we inject with fertility drugs. 	 we're taking eggs from the donors we inject with reproductive drugs. maxlen: 28
4062 	 we then take cells from the cloning candidate, cindy stoller. 	 from the clone candidate, this is cindy stoller, getting cells. maxlen: 34

4065 	 it's just now fascinating? 	 just this part? maxlen: 15
4066 	 then we suck the nucleus out of each egg with a needle. 	 then pull the core of every egg, with a needle. maxlen: 23
4067 	 lots of needles in cloning. 	 the needle in the cloning is too much. maxlen: 19
4068 	 we take the sucked-out dna-free eggs and place them with the donor cells. 	 we put the dna removed, the eggs, next to the transmitter cell. maxlen: 27
4069 	 in this case, cindy's. 	 so cindy's cell. maxlen: 18
4070 	 and we zap them. 	 and practice energy. maxlen: 13
4071 	 what do you mean? 	 what does that mean? maxlen: 11
4072 	 we fire off a jolt, kind of like... 	 we're in shock, kind of electricity... maxlen: 22
4073 	 i'm trying to get an idea. 	 i'm trying to understand. maxlen: 13
4074 	 you're planting the idea that it's like killing bugs and i find it gross, even for an ombudsman. 	 you're downloading it to kill bugs, and i find it disgusting, even for a public supervisor. maxlen: 39

4076 	 you're both losing points with me. 	 you two are falling out of my sight. maxlen: 22
4077 	 what happens to the cells after you zap them? 	 after energy is given, what happens to cells? maxlen: 21
4078 	 when we zap the donor cells in the dna-free cells they fuse together. 	 when the transmitter cells are given energy to the dnaless cells, they fuse each other. maxlen: 31
4079 	 we then plant them in the surrogate mother and what may result is a cloned baby. 	 then we put them in the surrogate mom, and it's a clone baby. maxlen: 32
