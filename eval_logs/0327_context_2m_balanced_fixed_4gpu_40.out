4059 	 how does this cloning work? 	 how does this cloning work? maxlen: 15
4060 	 oh, it's fascinating. 	 very impressive. maxlen: 11
4061 	 we harvest eggs from donors who we inject with fertility drugs. 	 we're getting eggs from the transmitters we injecting the reproductive drugs. maxlen: 28
4062 	 we then take cells from the cloning candidate, cindy stoller. 	 from the cloning candidate, this is cindy stoller, we're taking cells. maxlen: 34
4063 	 oh, here's where it gets fascinating. 	 this part is very impressive. maxlen: 14
4064 	 the witness previously said it was "fascinating." 	 the witness said it was fascinating. maxlen: 19
4065 	 it's just now fascinating? 	 is this just impressive? maxlen: 15
4066 	 then we suck the nucleus out of each egg with a needle. 	 then we lure every egg core with a needle. maxlen: 23
4067 	 lots of needles in cloning. 	 there's too much needle in the cloning. maxlen: 19
4068 	 we take the sucked-out dna-free eggs and place them with the donor cells. 	 we're putting the dna-free eggs next to the transmitter cell. maxlen: 27
4069 	 in this case, cindy's. 	 in that case, cindy's cell. maxlen: 18
4070 	 and we zap them. 	 and we're energizing. maxlen: 13
4071 	 what do you mean? 	 what does that mean? maxlen: 11
4072 	 we fire off a jolt, kind of like... 	 we're dealing with heat, sort of an electrical... maxlen: 22
4073 	 i'm trying to get an idea. 	 i'm trying to understand. maxlen: 13
4074 	 you're planting the idea that it's like killing bugs and i find it gross, even for an ombudsman. 	 you're trying to kill the bug, and i find it disgusting, even for a public supervisor. maxlen: 39
4075 	 let's proceed. 	 let's move on. maxlen: 11
4076 	 you're both losing points with me. 	 you both fall out of my sight. maxlen: 22
4077 	 what happens to the cells after you zap them? 	 what happens to the cells after the energy is given? maxlen: 21
4078 	 when we zap the donor cells in the dna-free cells they fuse together. 	 they mingle each other when they're given energy to dna-free cells. maxlen: 31
4079 	 we then plant them in the surrogate mother and what may result is a cloned baby. 	 then we put these in the surrogate mother, and eventually there's a cloned baby. maxlen: 32
