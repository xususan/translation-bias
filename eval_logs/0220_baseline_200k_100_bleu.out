38 	 well, i don't know why i'm telling you this. 	 you dig this for him and you decide me, maxlen: 19
39 	 i guess there's just some things you can't really say to your dad. 	 you know, this 00:00 p.m., the hardest one, without two... maxlen: 23
40 	 [narrator] lindsay believed that george michael wanted to fix up his father... so he could fill the role ofhis mother. 	 the scent of the hand, peter, wasn't on what it was going through... hey, hey tell the comical lie, go lie. maxlen: 41
41 	 there's nothing wrong with that. 	 "i sink, maxlen: 14

46 	 but until then, i'll be right across the hall. 	 so, first of all, the rust, the japanese bad sidekick, that's to me, maxlen: 27
47 	 [narrator] lindsay had never been more proud of anything she had said in her entire life. 	 the scent of the hand... can meet worrying and your lover is 00 left, maxlen: 30
48 	 [narrator] meanwhile, gob was waiting for michael to show up. 	 what's your end again, if you don't? maxlen: 25

54 	 oh... { laughs] "nagarma," you've got a mustache. 	 they need to be called "woman," maxlen: 21
55 	 i mean, you've got a milk mustache. 	 he doesn't want to say, "his name is a woman, maxlen: 17
56 	 yeah. 	 well, maxlen: 9
57 	 [narrator] but gob mistook michael's basic human decency for romantic interest... and felt a competitive urge to step in. 	 so what's the end of the line again, you know, what's in your plates again, if you've got the plumbing in the back, i'm s-sucking maxlen: 45
58 	 because, you know, it's beyond adorable... and e-exotic. 	 wait, what about my daddy, my sandwich girl, and my password i slip blue, greg? maxlen: 31
59 	 i find you very attractive. 	 here comes the ankle, maxlen: 15
60 	 { nazhgalia, michael, shannon] really? 	 was it supposed to be sixth of us, the end of love i don't blaze? maxlen: 25
61 	 [narrator] and george sr. was about to get a surprise visitor. 	 i'm sorry about peter skipping on you, but i think i've just seen you get arrested. maxlen: 26
62 	 i've studied all your teachings, and i've purchased every tape. 	 i mean, it's like he's got some kind of anxiety for different people, maxlen: 27
63 	 and i watch 'em over and over. 	 let's get down there. maxlen: 17
64 	 [narrator] george sr. had recently marketed a line of self-help tapes... touting his newly discovered spirituality. 	 peterordord, he's gonna be cut off from his own perception... which is going to cut off marie... that i'm gonna have to put some fingerprint on the earth... siria, on the side maxlen: 51
65 	 i've also lost four pounds on your low-carb bluth banana jail bars. { giggles] 	 once you're in the company and the command posts, make sure they feel like a full bargain, maxlen: 32
66 	 i've come to learn at your feet. 	 by the end of the day, maxlen: 13
67 	 that's a good place to start. 	 i don't want him to know... maxlen: 17
68 	 [narrator] and michael, free ofhis double date, met lindsay at parent-teacher night. 	 that's why the end came here, alper, washed it down with a share of your feelings, 00/0. maxlen: 47
69 	 hey, linds, is it my imagination... or does this rape room have the same floor plan as our kitchen? 	 oh, my god, what smells like, every time you're talking about my love, you're insane? maxlen: 47
70 	 well, i think she's perfect for you. 	 and for the record, maxlen: 15
71 	 you'd think that would turn him off to the entire concept. 	 a vacation on the ground made it clear to the valedictor, as in tea. maxlen: 26
72 	 besides, i'm not gonna rush out and marry somebody just because you think my son would like it. 	 i mean, close to the morning? maxlen: 35
73 	 i'm ms. baerly, the ethics teacher. 	 few ossse moves, eh? maxlen: 18
74 	 my goal is to teach your children about the preciousness oflife... that can be lost by the mindless pulling of a trigger. 	 _ maxlen: 37
75 	 [narrator] and so michael got to know his son's ethics teacher. 	 if you're worried about the end you're gonna get the show, maxlen: 21
76 	 i guess that's the "rrrr" of it. 	 sandar was writing, saving! maxlen: 22
77 	 you know, so frustrating. 	 daumm de tantalent, maxlen: 17
78 	 i mean, they just threw this class at me after mr. daniels had a stroke. 	 i'm dead, i'm his cruziti, vegenir, but there's no shame in it! maxlen: 35
79 	 thought you were joking. 	 it's confined maxlen: 14
80 	 no, i was just laughing 'cause you were laughing. 	 you're doing what you're having sex... sex enough, maxlen: 23
81 	 "rrrr!" - { laughs] "rrrr!" 	 _ maxlen: 25
82 	 but, you know, l-l... 	 what about the same one? maxlen: 15
83 	 and i think i'm an ethical person. 	 you know, sadaver, it's sweet, maxlen: 19
84 	 right. 	 well, maxlen: 9
85 	 here's an ethical question. 	 for the record, for the record, maxlen: 17
86 	 can-can a parent take a teacher out for a drink? 	 i'm a basic dad-i'm making two. maxlen: 22
87 	 or... 	 first things first maxlen: 9
88 	 yeah, she died. 	 you know, sh? maxlen: 11
89 	 well, it's the mr. daniels stroke thing... 	 you know his judgment was his cruzite, but it wasn't, it was ready for me. maxlen: 30
90 	 let's go get that drink. 	 okay, i'm just a couple of killers, so... maxlen: 19
91 	 yeah, it could only help. 	 your immunity? maxlen: 14
92 	 [narrator] george sr. was dealing with his own admirer. 	 peter was, uh, you know, uh, uh, uh, uh maxlen: 21
93 	 oh, i've already told you so many of my sins. 	 and for the record, this is the cheekiest, maxlen: 21
94 	 maybe you could tell me some of yours. 	 i don't want to, but i don't know why his human flesh maxlen: 19
95 	 uh, well, there are legal implications to that. 	 i've seen a lot of them, the entire execution of an athlete, maxlen: 25
96 	 but, uh, back to your sins. 	 it's just that his dream didn't burn, so... maxlen: 19
97 	 uh, do that one about the, uh... { takes deep breath] ladies' shower... in your college dorm again. 	 thank you for your dick, mr. mc full i fucking need, maxlen: 28
98 	 [narrator] and michael was on his way to what would be his second date... 	 i mean, the screen is the only way my alper's ever been in this place is if he's acting, and that' maxlen: 30
99 	 michael, the little korean is here, and i don't know what to do with him. 	 it's not blessing that we're going to consent on the ending. maxlen: 27
100 	 at least, i think it's a him. 	 do it, little one, will you? maxlen: 17
101 	 you've got to strip them down to next to nothing before you can even tell. 	 i'll see... when you're staying, it's perfect, maxlen: 23
102 	 yeah, mom. 	 another thing? maxlen: 11
103 	 they will take him back. 	 _ maxlen: 11

109 	 what, i'm gone for a couple days and you find a new son? 	 is that why the end of the world slides into the sea and it's mine? maxlen: 32
110 	 [narrator] lucille could see that her son was concerned, even jealous. 	 the precious 00 birds, and the fact that we've had our lives cut off from each other, maxlen: 32
111 	 and she knew how it felt to be overlooked. 	 _ maxlen: 23
112 	 annyong is your brother now. 	 # she's so damaged # maxlen: 15
113 	 call it off. 	 i wasted it, maxlen: 13
114 	 i'm keeping him. 	 let me go, maxlen: 9

125 	 but how are we going to sneak in without waking everyone up? 	 call me on the court, fly is a strange patch maxlen: 22
126 	 this may not have been my best idea. 	 and now it's all down in the sun, maxlen: 22
127 	 i'm sorry, michael. 	 the check's over there, eh? maxlen: 13
128 	 i'm sorry too, michael, but it looks like we're even. 	 but the check is there, so the end is right, the wrong warm-blooded mother, maxlen: 27

157 	 dad, what was she doing here? 	 once again a long way? maxlen: 14
158 	 [narrator] michael knew he had an ethical responsibility to tell his son the truth. 	 take a look at the end of this place... and i'll tell you what, harry, maxlen: 34
159 	 yes. 	 well, maxlen: 9
160 	 your uncle gob slept with her. 	 if you're gonna be late again, maxlen: 17

163 	 you and i know that, but gob he just... 	 wipe him out again, eh? maxlen: 22
164 	 he's not that exact of a target shooter, and he just kind of sprays it everywhere. 	 you can't have a life if you're on the road you don't have money, right? maxlen: 32
165 	 you know, but listen, did-did you really think that-that... that you had a... 	 how do you get to the dummy? maxlen: 28
166 	 i mean, she's kinda old for you, don't you think? 	 i'm dying... how am i doing in jail? maxlen: 28
167 	 we don't even know how old she is. 	 how old was your last one, maxlen: 17
168 	 no one does. 	 genius, maxlen: 10
169 	 she was chaperoning the diversity dance... and i thought maybe as a joke, i'd go up to her and be, like... 	 so, you're in the hill, so you're talking about aborn, but if you need a 00-year-old bomb, do you think everyone's going? maxlen: 43
170 	 "well, hey, do you want to dance?" 	 how many home and danger in their ears? maxlen: 18
171 	 and she'd be, like, "ah, what the heck?" right? 	 sieti teimirtmy's going away and the rest of us are in danger here? maxlen: 34
172 	 i did it differently in the mirror, but... 	 is this the old man who fits about it? maxlen: 17
173 	 but, you know, like, we'd be joke dancing or something. 	 and if i always find them, they'll be the first to know they're worth 00? maxlen: 37
174 	 i didn't think it through. 	 i need you to go, my mother, maxlen: 17
175 	 don't you think you should be taking somebody your own age? 	 ...the old one, the one, the big one. maxlen: 22
176 	 like your cousin. 	 fight it out. maxlen: 10
177 	 i defaced a rare book to get that picture of saddam hussein in a bathing suit. 	 the scent of the scratching times, the ambulance of an ambulance of an ambulance... was sitting in the presence of my body, maxlen: 37
178 	 "what would saddam do?" 	 _ maxlen: 15
179 	 yeah. 	 well, maxlen: 9
180 	 yeah, you know something? 	 what about you? maxlen: 18
181 	 okay, that is our exact outdoor fire pit. 	 if you'd like to know, the patient in angie, maxlen: 22
182 	 [narrator] at prison, george sr. was preparing for an evening with his most devoted fan. 	 it's peter, it's the way it goes, the speedsters should go, but the talking of marriage goes on, far away, maxlen: 36
183 	 while cindi lightballoon was making preparations ofher own. 	 it's the first time in the midst of priceridge, the political science, maxlen: 23
184 	 how we doin'? 	 i'm done maxlen: 11
185 	 [man] we have video. 	 i'm destroying it, maxlen: 14
186 	 [narrator] so george michael, still angry at gob... sought out the family expert on making trouble. 	 s. peter, by the end of the day, the i.t.t. terrick is the only one behind him again, maxlen: 40
187 	 i know he was dating that girl shannon. 	 and it's not like he's a star, and it's maxlen: 17
188 	 the cheerleader? 	 another one that says he's got a scarf. maxlen: 17
189 	 yeah, she's probably gonna take him to that stupid diversity dance. 	 he says he understands the magic of the hill, beka, maxlen: 26
190 	 i wish i had someone shocking to take. 	 he's the only one who can't, but if they're on top of it all, fuck it, maxlen: 27
191 	 you know, i actually called mr. daniels and asked him... but he got all out of breath and dropped the phone. 	 my daumm is the only one who's had his cruzite... to give him that wench of yours... well, damn it, bit of a lie, huh? maxlen: 49
192 	 i never heard back. 	 it's like money, maxlen: 14
193 	 you know, may-maybe we should go together. 	 i don't know if it's my daisy or the defendant, but i'm sorry maxlen: 25

2137 	 actually, try to save it with a perm first, then cut your losses. 	 do you think it's so long that i have no appendix of pride? maxlen: 25
2138 	 is riley still in love with ben, or was that just something from back when they were kids? 	 i want to thank you so much for talking chinese-time hiking! maxlen: 32
2139 	 unless of course, you're still in love with riley. 	 you realize you're here now with time to walk, maxlen: 26
2140 	 i ruined her sweet sixteen. 	 why don't you take your shrimp and eat your husband's tea, maxlen: 25
2141 	 maybe not around her birthday, but the rest of the time, definitely a fan. 	 is it strong morning, 00 a.m., 'cause you were so smart, maxlen: 25
2142 	 well, if ben is so irresponsible that he lost the papers and so immature that he couldn't face me himself, then maybe he's not responsible enough to have sole custody of emma. 	 well, it's like there's a fucking thing in there, and every time you like mrs. recordingon, you don't love it, but thanks to goddamn it, i'm so damn it! maxlen: 60
2143 	 if it makes you feel any better, we actually do a lot of the work. 	 you're so proud, the meat's in love and everything else, maxlen: 28
