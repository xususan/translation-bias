6690 	 it's third-generation management, and they've let it run down terribly. 	 this third generation is taking over, and the production is horribly down. maxlen: 32
6691 	 but they have a small subsidiary that's a real gem. 	 but there's a small amount of patio companies, and that's what the job is about. maxlen: 27
6692 	 the cannery itself is sitting on prime waterfront land. 	 the factory is built on a precious land near the sea. maxlen: 18
